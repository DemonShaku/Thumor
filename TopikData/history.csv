1,Events occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
2,"""History"" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events."
3,Historians seek to understand and represent the past through narratives.
4,"They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
5,History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
6,"However, ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
7,"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
8,"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
9,"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within the Western tradition) to be the ""father of history"", or, the ""father of lies""."
10,"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history."
11,"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
12,"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
13,It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his History of Animals.
14,"The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either ""judge"" or ""witness"", or similar)."
15,"The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning ""investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative""."
16,"History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær (""history, narrative, story""), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period."
17,"In Middle English, the meaning of history was ""story"" in general."
20,"With the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about natural history."
21,"In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both ""history"" and ""story""."
22,"Historian in the sense of a ""researcher of history"" is attested from 1531."
23,"In all European languages, the substantive history is still used to mean both ""what happened with men"", and ""the scholarly study of the happened"", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, or the word historiography."
24,"The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669."
25,"In the words of Benedetto Croce, ""All history is contemporary history""."
26,"History is facilitated by the formation of a ""true discourse of past"" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race."
27,The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
28,All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.
29,The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past.
30,"Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the ""true past"")."
31,"Part of the historian's role is to skillfully and objectively utilize the vast amount of sources from the past, most often found in the archives."
32,"It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both."
33,Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.
34,"In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history."
35,"Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts."
36,"From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures."
37,"In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three."
38,But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
39,"Archaeology is especially helpful in unearthing buried sites and objects, which contribute to the study of history."
40,"Archaeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries."
41,Archaeology's methodologies and approaches are independent from the field of history.
42,"""Historical archaeology"" is a specific branch of archaeology which often contrasts its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources."
43,"For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing ""liberty"" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment."
44,"There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically."
45,"These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are often present."
46,"It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization."
47,"The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends."
48,"History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity."
49,"By ""prehistory"", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood."
50,"By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record."
51,"Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America."
52,Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world.
53,History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future.
54,Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.
55,"This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Indigenous Australians and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization."
56,"Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis)."
57,"Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, ""medieval historiography during the 1960s"" means ""Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"")."
58,"Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history."
59,"As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, world view, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians."
60,Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.
64,"Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself)."
65,"In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a nominally neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings."
66,"The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the Han dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji)."
67,"For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese historiography."
68,"Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective."
69,"In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation."
70,"The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past."
71,"Ibn Khaldun often criticized ""idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data."""
72,"As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his ""new science""."
77,He limited history to “what really happened” and by this directed the field further away from science.
78,"For Ranke, historical data should be collected carefully, examined objectively and put together with critical rigor."
79,But these procedures “are merely the prerequisites and preliminaries of science.
80,"Thus if Historians tell us that, given the manner in which he practices his craft, it cannot be considered a science, we must take him at his word."
81,"If he is not doing science, then, whatever else he is doing, he is not doing science."
82,"The traditional Historian is thus no scientist and history, as conventionally practiced, is not a science."
83,"In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces."
84,"A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case."
85,Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach.
86,"Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics."
87,"Nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history."
88,So far only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional Historian.
89,"Whatever other theories of history we have, they were written by experts from other fields (for example, Marxian theory of history)."
90,"More recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship."
91,"In sincere opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as an art."
94,"Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history."
95,"American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups."
96,Another genre of social history to emerge in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life).
97,"Scholars such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period."
98,"Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past."
99,"In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources."
100,"Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History."
101,"Today, most historians begin their research process in the archives, on either a physical or digital platform."
102,They often propose an argument and use their research to support it.
103,"Digital information companies, such as Google, have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access."
104,"Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe."
105,"Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship."
106,Constantin Fasolt suggested that history is linked to politics by the practice of silence itself.
107,Historical omissions can occur in many ways and can have a profound effect on historical records.
108,Information can also purposely be excluded or left out accidentally.
109,"Historians have coined multiple terms that describe the act of omitting historical information, including: “silencing,” “selective memory,” and erasures."
110,"Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow ""organising ideas and classificatory generalisations"" to be used by historians."
111,"The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period."
112,Centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used.
113,Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past.
114,The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.
115,"The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains."
116,"Here prehistory is divided into a series of ""chapters"" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology."
117,This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation.
118,"There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning."
119,"Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use."
120,"In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used."
121,"Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that ""cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries"" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena."
122,Understanding why historic events took place is important.
123,"To do this, historians often turn to geography."
124,"According to Jules Michelet in his book Histoire de France (1833), ""without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."""
125,"Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there."
126,"For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is essential."
127,"Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks."
128,The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities.
129,"That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization."
130,"There is also the case of climate, which historians like Ellsworth Huntington and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament."
147,"The ""new military history"" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture."
148,"Leading journals include Church History, The Catholic Historical Review, and History of Religions."
149,"Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy."
150,This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.
151,"In its ""golden age"" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments."
152,"In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%."
153,"In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%)."
154,"The ""old"" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were ""social"" in the sense of being outside the elite system."
155,"Social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men."
156,"While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as ""history with the people put back in."""
157,"It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience."
158,"It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people."
159,How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
160,Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography).
161,More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights.
162,"It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history."
163,This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time.
164,"Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, ""diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."""
165,"She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it."
166,"Business history  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society."
167,"It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs."
168,It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.
169,"It is an offshoot of the environmental movement, which was kickstarted by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in the 1960s."
170,"World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field."
171,"It gained popularity in the United States, Japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds."
172,The World History Association publishes the Journal of World History every quarter since 1990.
173,"The H-World discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews."
174,A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders.
175,"Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people."
176,"The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the History Workshop movement in Britain in the 1960s."
177,The outgrowth of gender history from women's history stemmed from many non-feminist historians dismissing the importance of women in history.
178,"Despite being a relatively new field, gender history has had a significant effect on the general study of history."
179,"Gender history traditionally differs from women's history in its inclusion of all aspects of gender such as masculinity and femininity, and today's gender history extends to include people who identify outside of that binary."
180,"Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields."
181,"Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government."
182,"A common feature of LGBTQ+ history is the focus on oral history and individual perspectives, in addition to traditional documents within the archives."
183,"They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources, verbal stories or oral histories, and other archival material."
184,"In lists of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized."
185,"Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included."
186,"The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final."
187,A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.
188,It is closely related to deceptive historical revisionism.
189,"Works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory."
190,"At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed."
191,"Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists."
192,"The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars."
193,The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War.
194,A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty.
195,"Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching."
196,"In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe."
197,Many view the field from both perspectives.
198,The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers.
199,"Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP)."
200,"Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates."
201,"Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote ""active methods"" which would give pupils ""the immense happiness of discovery."""
202,Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored.
203,Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.
204,"For example, in Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment."
205,Other countries have complained.
206,"An example of content that is represented different in different regions of the country is the history of the Southern states, where slavery and the American Civil War are treated as controversial topics."
207,"The result is that ""German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."""
