0,"The British Empire was composed of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states."
1,It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries.
2,"At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power."
4,"As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread."
5,"Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia."
6,"A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (Britain, following the 1707 Act of Union with Scotland) the dominant colonial power in North America."
7,Britain became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.
8,The American War of Independence resulted in Britain losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies in North America by 1783.
9,"British attention turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific."
12,"Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its colonies, its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America."
13,"Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, some of which were reclassified as dominions."
14,"By the start of the 20th century, Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead."
15,"Military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, during which Britain relied heavily on its empire."
16,"The conflict placed enormous strain on its military, financial, and manpower resources."
17,"Although the empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power."
18,"In the Second World War, Britain's colonies in East and Southeast Asia were occupied by Japan."
19,"Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire."
20,"India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire."
21,"The Suez Crisis confirmed Britain's decline as a global power, and the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire."
22,Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty.
23,"After independence, many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states."
24,"16 of these, including the United Kingdom, retain a common monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II."
25,"In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic."
27,"In the meantime, the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared ""that this realm of England is an Empire""."
28,The Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies.
29,"In 1562, the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade."
30,"This effort was rebuffed and later, as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the New World."
31,"At the same time, influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee (who was the first to use the term ""British Empire"") were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire."
32,"Several people who helped establish colonies in Ireland also later played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men."
33,"That year, Gilbert sailed for the Caribbean with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic."
35,"On this occasion he formally claimed the harbour of the island of Newfoundland, although no settlers were left behind."
36,"Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584."
37,"Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies."
38,"The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of joint-stock companies, most notably the East India Company, to administer colonies and overseas trade."
39,"This period, until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century, has been referred to by some historians as the ""First British Empire""."
40,"An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits."
41,"The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar."
42,"To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies."
43,This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.
46,"The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful."
47,"In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for Puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims."
48,"Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics (1634), Rhode Island (1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut (1639) for Congregationalists."
51,"This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname."
52,"In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn."
53,"The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates."
54,"In 1670, Charles II incorporated by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the fur trade in the area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form a large proportion of the Dominion of Canada."
55,"From the outset, slavery was the basis of the Empire in the West Indies."
56,"To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island."
57,"In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies)."
58,"For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas."
59,"For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven."
60,"The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India."
61,"There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other."
62,"Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia."
63,"Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England."
64,"In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted for thirteen years."
65,"Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later."
66,The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire.
67,"The episode also had major political consequences, helping to persuade the government of Scotland of the merits of a union of the two countries, rather than just crowns."
68,"Philip V of Spain renounced his and his descendants' claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe."
69,"The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain Gibraltar and Menorca."
70,Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.
71,Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell African slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.
72,"With the outbreak of the Anglo-Spanish War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739, Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes."
73,"In 1746, the Spanish and British began peace talks, with the King of Spain agreeing to stop all attacks on British shipping; however, in the Treaty of Madrid Britain lost its slave trading rights in South and Central America."
74,"In the East Indies, British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles."
76,"France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India."
77,"In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the Presidency Armies, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys, led by British officers."
78,"In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert's Land, and the ceding of New France to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and Louisiana to Spain."
79,Spain ceded Florida to Britain.
80,"Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power."
81,"This was summarised at the time by the slogan ""No taxation without representation"", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen."
82,The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government.
83,"In response, Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775."
85,"The entry of French and Spanish forces into the war tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms."
86,"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal."
88,"The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory."
89,"In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States."
90,"Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to Australia."
91,"The coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch in 1606, but there was no attempt to colonise it."
95,"Indigenous Australians were considered too uncivilised to require treaties, and colonisation brought disease and violence that together with the deliberate dispossession of land and culture were devastating to these peoples."
96,"Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840, to Tasmania until 1853 and to Western Australia until 1868."
97,"Initially, interaction between the indigenous Māori population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods."
98,"European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North."
99,"In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand."
100,"On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi."
101,"This treaty is considered to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute."
105,"Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony."
106,"Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815) and  Heligoland."
107,Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular slave rebellions.
108,"With support from the British abolitionist movement, Parliament enacted the Slave Trade Act in 1807, which abolished the slave trade in the empire."
109,"In 1808, Sierra Leone Colony was designated an official British colony for freed slaves."
110,Parliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the West India Committee decline.
111,"The Slavery Abolition Act, passed the following year, abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, finally bringing the Empire into line with the law in the UK (with the exception of the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon, where slavery was ended in 1844)."
112,"Under the Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of four to six years of ""apprenticeship""."
114,The British government compensated slave-owners.
115,"Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in Central Asia."
116,"Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the Pax Britannica, and a foreign policy of ""splendid isolation""."
117,"Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam, which has been described by some historians as an ""Informal Empire""."
118,"British imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph, new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire."
119,"By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, called the All Red Line."
120,"This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China."
121,"A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired."
122,"The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline."
123,"The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides."
124,"The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India."
125,The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule.
126,"Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect."
127,"This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the ""Great Game""."
128,"As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India."
129,"The ensuing Crimean War (1854–1856), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia."
130,"The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan."
131,"For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente."
132,The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 also limited its threat to the British.
133,"Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign."
134,"British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s."
135,"In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations."
136,Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–1877; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902).
137,"Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the ""jugular vein of the Empire""."
138,"In 1875, the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma'il Pasha's 44% shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (equivalent to £380 million in 2019)."
139,"Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage."
141,"Although Britain controlled Egypt into the 20th century, it was officially part of the Ottoman Empire and not part of the British Empire."
142,"The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan."
143,"A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in 1896, and rebuffed an attempted French invasion at Fashoda in 1898."
144,"During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned British South Africa Company, occupied and annexed territories named after him, Rhodesia."
145,"This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840, which created the Province of Canada."
149,"Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852."
150,"Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister, William Gladstone, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament."
151,"Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire."
152,A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons.
153,"A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising."
154,Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war.
155,"Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific and threatened at home by the Imperial German Navy, Britain formed an alliance with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies France and Russia in 1904 and 1907, respectively."
156,Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa.
157,"In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and German Samoa respectively."
158,"Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement."
159,"The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right."
160,The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on Anzac Day.
161,Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light.
162,The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates.
163,"Britain gained control of Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq, parts of Cameroon and Togoland, and Tanganyika."
164,"The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa (modern-day Namibia), Australia gained New Guinea, and New Zealand Western Samoa."
165,Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.
166,"Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States."
167,"This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the Great Depression, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations."
168,The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration.
169,"The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown."
170,"Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom."
171,A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence.
172,Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts.
173,"This led to tension, particularly in the Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre."
174,"In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion."
175,"British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone."
176,"In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the League of Nations."
177,"Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932."
178,"In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews."
179,"The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power."
181,"Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne."
183,This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster.
184,"The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent."
185,"Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression."
186,In 1937 the Irish Free State introduced a republican constitution renaming itself Ireland.
188,"In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that ""the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live"" should be respected."
189,"He felt that Britain was now assured of victory, but failed to recognise that the ""many disasters, immeasurable costs and tribulations [which he knew] lay ahead"" in December 1941 would have permanent consequences for the future of the empire."
190,"The manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power, including, particularly, the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar."
191,"The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States and, ultimately, the 1951 ANZUS Pact."
192,"The war weakened the empire in other ways: undermining Britain's control of politics in India, inflicting long term economic damage, and irrevocably changing geopolitics by pushing the Soviet Union and the United States to the centre of the global stage."
193,"Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power."
194,"At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations."
195,The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union.
196,"In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism."
197,"In practice, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check."
198,"At first British politicians believed it would be possible to maintain Britain's role as a world power at the head of a re-imagined Commonwealth, but by 1960 they were forced to recognise that there was an irresistible ""wind of change"" blowing."
199,"Their priorities changed to maintaining an extensive zone of British influence and ensuring that stable, non-Communist governments were established in former colonies."
200,"In this context, while other European powers such as France and Portugal, waged costly and unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact, Britain generally adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies."
202,"Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to 5 million, 3 million of whom were in Hong Kong."
203,"India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented."
204,"Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions."
205,Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 30 June 1948.
206,"When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947."
207,The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan.
208,"Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives."
209,"Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948."
210,"The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state."
211,"Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve."
212,The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.
213,"It was immediately followed by the outbreak of a civil war between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine, and British forces withdrew amid the fighting."
214,"The British Mandate for Palestine officially terminated at midnight on 15 May 1948 as the State of Israel declared independence and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, during which the territory of the former Mandate was partitioned between Israel and the surrounding Arab states."
215,"The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted."
216,"The Malayan Emergency, as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth."
217,"In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia, but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations and became an independent city-state."
218,"Brunei, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union."
219,"Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India."
220,"Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow."
221,"The response of Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal."
222,Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side.
223,Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.
224,"The events at Suez wounded British national pride, leading one MP to describe it as ""Britain's Waterloo"" and another to suggest that the country had become an ""American satellite""."
225,"Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in Oman (1957), Jordan (1958) and Kuwait (1961), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States."
