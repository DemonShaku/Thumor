0,Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected in municipal and international law.
1,"They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being"" and which are ""inherent in all human beings"", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status."
2,"They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone."
3,Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide.
4,"The idea of human rights suggests that ""if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights""."
5,"The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day."
6,Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.
7,"The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution."
8,"From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society."
9,The true forerunner of human-rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment.
10,"In Britain in 1689, the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions."
11,"Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights."
12,"Additionally, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms."
13,"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
14,"In 1831 William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a newspaper called The Liberator that he was trying to enlist his readers in ""the great cause of human rights"" so the term human rights probably came into use sometime between Paine's The Rights of Man and Garrison's publication."
15,"In 1849 a contemporary, Henry David Thoreau, wrote about human rights in his treatise On the Duty of Civil Disobedience [1] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers."
16,"United States Supreme Court Justice David Davis, in his 1867 opinion for Ex Parte Milligan, wrote ""By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people."
17,"""Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights."
18,"In Western Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour."
19,The women's rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote.
20,National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers.
21,One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi's movement to free his native India from British rule.
22,"Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the civil rights movement, and more recent diverse identity politics movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States."
23,"The foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the 1864 Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of International humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two World Wars."
24,"The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare."
25,Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
26,The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.
28,All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated-against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide-reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite.
29,"The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the ""foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world""."
30,The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the rights-duty duality.
31,"The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced."
32,"The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority."
33,"Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer Rene Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble."
34,"The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights."
35,"The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized."
37,"Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi."
38,"The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked."
39,"Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights (such as freedom of association and expression), and were reluctant to include economic and social rights (such as the right to work and the right to join a union)."
40,"However, they came into force only in 1976, when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries (despite achieving the ICCPR, a covenant including no economic or social rights, the US only ratified the ICCPR in 1992)."
41,"The ICESCR commits 155 state parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to individuals."
42,Since then numerous other treaties (pieces of legislation) have been offered at the international level.
43,They are generally known as human rights instruments.
44,"All UN organs have advisory roles to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council, and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties."
45,The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
46,"47 of the 193 UN member states sit on the Council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the United Nations General Assembly."
47,Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses.
48,The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council refer cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.
49,"They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties – rather than subsidiary to the United Nations, though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights."
50,The Human Rights Committee promotes participation with the standards of the ICCPR.
51,The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty.
52,"The judgments, termed ""views"", are not legally binding."
54,It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force.
55,"It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly."
56,"This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively ""weak"" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies."
57,"Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information."
58,The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination monitors the CERD and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance.
59,"It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding."
60,It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
61,The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women monitors the CEDAW.
62,"It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol."
63,The Committee Against Torture monitors the CAT and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them.
64,Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
65,The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors the CRC and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years.
66,It does not have the power to receive complaints.
67,The Committee on Migrant Workers was established in 2004 and monitors the ICRMW and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years.
68,It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
69,The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was established in 2008 to monitor the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
70,It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
71,The Committee on Enforced Disappearances monitors the ICPPED.
72,All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented.
73,CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva.
74,The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.
76,"In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice."
77,"Although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, as well as act as the supreme court of the African Union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties."
78,The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights entered into force in January 2004 but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment.
79,Its members are the thirty-five independent states of the Americas.
80,"Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War, the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward globalization, the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context."
81,"Along with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, based in San José, Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights."
82,The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere.
84,Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory.
85,"Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it."
86,"Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states."
87,"The organisation now also includes Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia."
88,It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations.
89,The seat of the Council of Europe is in Strasbourg in France.
90,The Council of Europe is responsible for both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.
91,"These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights."
92,The Council also promotes the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the European Social Charter.
93,All 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed this Convention and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
94,"In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment (Article 3 of the Convention), the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture was established."
95,"One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds."
96,Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume).
97,Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber).
98,These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract.
99,"Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (dikaion physikon, δικαιον φυσικον, Latin ius naturale)."
100,"Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Francisco Suárez, Richard Hooker, Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and John Locke."
101,"In the Seventeenth Century Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another)."
102,"The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act."
103,"It was discovered by considering humankind's natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law."
104,"In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign."
105,In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.
106,Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law.
107,"He wrote that ""even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate"" natural law, which ""would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs."""
109,"This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus (non-esse Deum), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology."
110,"John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in Two Treatises of Government."
111,"Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect ""life, liberty, and property,"" people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one."
112,The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition.
114,Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR.
115,"Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR."
118,"Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing."
119,"For example, in the United States there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use."
120,That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this).
121,"Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights."
122,"Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights: first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment)."
123,"Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition."
124,"This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others."
125,Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity.
127,"Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation."
128,"Some human rights are said to be ""inalienable rights""."
129,"The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to ""a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered""."
131,"The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis."
132,This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).
133,"Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal, and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival."
134,Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women.
135,"For example, Female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America."
136,"It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures."
137,"It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries."
138,"Universalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism."
139,"In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere."
140,"For example, in 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was ""a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition"", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law."
141,"The former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, and of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad both claimed in the 1990s that Asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy."
143,This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.
144,"Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable."
146,"Non-State actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law, which applies to individuals."
147,"Multi-national companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses."
148,"Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multi-national companies is both controversial and ill-defined."
149,"Multi-national companies' primary responsibility is to their shareholders, not to those affected by their actions."
150,"Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power."
151,"No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable."
153,In August 2003 the Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights.
154,"These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored."
155,"Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to substantially reduce inequality by 2030 through the promotion of appropriate legislation."
157,Such International law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.
158,"In practice, many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them."
164,"The International Criminal Court is the body responsible for investigating and punishing war crimes, and Crimes against humanity when such occur within its jurisdiction, with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in 2002."
165,"If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation, it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity."
166,"Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles, the number and effect of these institutions is increasing."
167,"The Paris Principles were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris on 7–9 October 1991, and adopted by United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and the General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993."
168,"The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish."
169,"The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens."
170,"In 1993 Belgium passed a law of universal jurisdiction to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries, and in 1998 Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón under the universal jurisdiction principle."
171,"The principle is supported by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act, but others, including Henry Kissinger (who has himself been accused of war crimes by several commentators), argue that state sovereignty is paramount, because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states' sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons."
172,In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws.
173,Article 39 of the United Nations Charter designates the UN Security Council (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.
174,These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights.
175,"Wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, are breaches of International humanitarian law."
