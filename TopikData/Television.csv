0,"Television (TV), sometimes shortened to tele or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound."
1,"The term can refer to a television set, a television show, or the medium of television transmission."
2,"Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports."
3,"Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers."
4,"After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions."
7,"The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, high-capacity hard disk drives, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule."
8,"For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video on demand service by Netflix)."
10,"Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher."
16,"Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s."
17,"In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs."
19,"Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet."
21,"A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals."
22,A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.
23,"The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International World Fair in Paris."
25,"The use of the term to mean ""a television set"" dates from 1941."
26,"The slang term ""the tube"" or the ""boob tube"" derives from the bulky cathode ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs."
27,"The ""small screen"", as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the ""big screen"" was used to identify productions made for theatrical release."
29,Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.
30,Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873.
31,"As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884."
32,"This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image."
33,"Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk ""image rasterizer"" became exceedingly common."
34,Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on 24 August 1900.
35,"Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others."
36,"A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina."
37,"In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen."
38,A separate circuit regulated synchronization.
39,The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet.
40,"By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems."
41,"On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London."
42,"Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named ""Stooky Bill"", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving."
43,"By 26 January 1926, he had demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio."
44,This is widely regarded as the world's first public television demonstration.
45,Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it.
46,A brightly illuminated subject was placed in front of a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses which swept images across a static photocell.
47,"The thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA, detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal."
48,"This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first."
49,The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image.
50,"As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced."
51,"Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face."
52,"In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany."
53,"In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan."
54,"In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby."
55,"In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television."
56,"Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly."
58,Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens.
60,"Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images."
61,"Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound."
62,"The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey."
63,"Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality."
64,Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover.
65,A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects.
67,"The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds."
68,"Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: ""It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time."
69,It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.
71,"It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY."
74,"This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus."
77,The advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television.
78,"Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s."
79,The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.
80,"The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the ""Braun"" tube."
81,"It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube, with a phosphor-coated screen."
84,They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam.
86,"Both teams succeeded in transmitting ""very faint"" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate."
87,"Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel."
88,"The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or ""camera"" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924."
89,"His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (""photoelectrons"") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle."
90,"The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed ""Radioskop""."
92,The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October.
93,Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval.
94,Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.
96,This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver.
98,This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.
100,"That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (""Pem"") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required)."
101,"Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images."
104,Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage.
109,Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application.
111,"However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique ""multipactor"" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931."
112,This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics.
113,"However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film."
114,"Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards."
115,Mexican inventor Guillermo González Camarena also played an important role in early TV.
118,"On 2 November 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers."
119,"It alternated for a short time with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior."
120,"The EMI team, under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg, analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum."
121,"They solved this problem by developing, and patenting in 1934, two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron."
122,"The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater."
123,"It was used for outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch on a television set as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph."
124,"This was the first time that anyone had broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA would do the same until the 1939 New York World's Fair."
127,This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron.
128,"The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States."
129,"The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes."
130,"Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon."
131,"RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco."
133,"With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems."
137,"Following the invention of the first working transistor at Bell Labs, Sony founder Masaru Ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets."
138,"The first fully transistorized, portable solid-state television set was the 8-inch Sony TV8-301, developed in 1959 and released in 1960."
139,This began the transformation of television viewership from a communal viewing experience to a solitary viewing experience.
141,"Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning."
142,"Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver."
143,"But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it."
149,"Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre."
150,"Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image."
151,The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird.
153,"This device was very ""deep"", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console."
156,"The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set."
159,"These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press."
160,Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate.
161,The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other.
162,"Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained."
163,He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image.
165,Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color.
166,"However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system."
168,"The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface."
169,The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors.
170,The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.
171,"One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum."
172,"In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth."
175,"The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display."
176,The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image.
177,The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.
178,"The first color broadcast (the first episode of the live program The Marriage) occurred on 8 July 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white."
180,The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.
182,"Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place."
184,It used a transistor-based UHF tuner.
186,These developments made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition.
189,"Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967."
190,"By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid."
194,"Due to data compression, digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth."
195,It is an innovative service that represents the most significant evolution in television broadcast technology since color television emerged in the 1950s.
196,"Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers."
198,Motion-compensated DCT video compression significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth required for a digital TV signal.
200,"Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal."
201,This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.
203,"First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images."
206,"Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements."
207,"The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution."
208,This compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.
209,"Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones."
210,"In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth."
211,Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.
212,"Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second."
213,"The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not ""flicker"" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning."
214,"It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa."
215,The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats.
216,Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.
218,"Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly."
219,"But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions."
221,"Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional Broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access."
222,"Internet television refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems—terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods)."
223,IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters.
224,Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.
226,"Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs."
227,"Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015."
228,"Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses."
229,"Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London."
230,Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques.
233,"Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public."
236,"By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter."
237,"WRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB."
238,"It was popularly known as ""WGY Television"" after its sister radio station."
240,"The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company."
241,The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.
243,It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.
244,"With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna."
245,"A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for cord cutters."
246,All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.
247,"This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television."
250,"It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large ""community antennas"" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes."
251,The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.
253,The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB).
254,A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set.
255,"Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner."
256,"Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television."
258,"In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital."
259,Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only.
260,"These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes."
262,"Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription."
263,The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million.
265,"The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations."
266,"The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972."
270,"Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters."
271,"Internet television should not be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV."
272,Smart television refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system.
274,Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.
277,"The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax and VHS, which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies."
282,These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.
283,It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images.
285,"long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile."
286,"As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product."
287,"In television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster."
288,"An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference."
289,"In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument."
291,"While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997."
292,Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.
296,It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.
297,"They are called ""plasma"" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps."
298,"When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers."
299,"LCDs come in two types: those using cold cathode fluorescent lamps, simply called LCDs and those using LED as backlight called as LEDs."
305,This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes.
306,"Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent."
308,"It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs."
309,There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers.
310,"Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation."
312,"Active-matrix OLEDs require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes."
314,"Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD)."
315,"In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight."
317,It is used in handheld television.
318,"The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution video files could overwhelm computer servers and take too long to download."
319,"Many mobile phones and portable devices such as Apple's iPod Nano, or Sony's PlayStation Portable use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens (320×240 and 480×272 pixels respectively)."
331,Broadcast syndication: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run).
332,"It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer."
333,"This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA."
335,"Also, affiliates rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on local programming."
336,The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic miniseries.
337,"However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs."
338,"Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows."
339,"As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas."
340,"Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure."
341,Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as South Park.
342,"The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television."
343,Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes.
344,"Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures."
345,"Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies."
346,"There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments."
347,"A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (The Osbournes, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood) or doing regular jobs (The Simple Life)."
348,"Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are ""quality television"", include series such as Twin Peaks and The Sopranos."
349,"Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines."
