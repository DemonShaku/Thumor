1,"It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire."
2,"Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control."
3,"In AD 226, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians."
4,The division of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from AD 395) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines.
5,"A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra."
6,"Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC."
7,"It has been identified as having ""inspired some of the most important developments in human history, including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, and the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture""."
8,"An even earlier Greek usage of the name Mesopotamia is evident from The Anabasis of Alexander, which was written in the late 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great."
9,"In the Anabasis, Mesopotamia was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in north Syria."
11,"Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern Turkey."
12,"Upper Mesopotamia, also known as the Jazira, is the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris from their sources down to Baghdad."
13,"It is usually used to designate the area until the Muslim conquests, with names like Syria, Jazira, and Iraq being used to describe the region after that date."
14,It has been argued that these later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.
15,"Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region."
16,Overland routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult.
17,"The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way to a 15,000-square-kilometre (5,800 sq mi) region of marshes, lagoons, mudflats, and reed banks in the south."
18,"In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the Persian Gulf."
19,The arid environment ranges from the northern areas of rain-fed agriculture to the south where irrigation of agriculture is essential if a surplus energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) is to be obtained.
20,"This irrigation is aided by a high water table and by melting snows from the high peaks of the northern Zagros Mountains and from the Armenian Highlands, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that give the region its name."
21,"The usefulness of irrigation depends upon the ability to mobilize sufficient labor for the construction and maintenance of canals, and this, from the earliest period, has assisted the development of urban settlements and centralized systems of political authority."
22,"Agriculture throughout the region has been supplemented by nomadic pastoralism, where tent-dwelling nomads herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the river pastures in the dry summer months, out into seasonal grazing lands on the desert fringe in the wet winter season."
23,"The area is generally lacking in building stone, precious metals, and timber, and so historically has relied upon long-distance trade of agricultural products to secure these items from outlying areas."
24,"In the marshlands to the south of the area, a complex water-borne fishing culture has existed since prehistoric times and has added to the cultural mix."
25,Periodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons.
26,"The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur."
27,"Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems."
28,"Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city-states have meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units."
29,These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.
30,"This entire history ends with either the arrival of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 6th century BC or with the Muslim conquest and the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, from which point the region came to be known as Iraq."
31,"In the long span of this period, Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly developed, and socially complex states."
32,"The region was one of the four riverine civilizations where writing was invented, along with the Nile valley in Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yellow River in Ancient China."
33,"Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, Assur and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Eridu, the Akkadian kingdoms, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the various Assyrian empires."
34,"Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon of Akkad (who established the Akkadian Empire), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), Ashur-uballit II and Tiglath-Pileser I (who established the Assyrian Empire)."
35,"Scientists analysed DNA from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in Germany."
36,They compared the genetic signatures to those of modern populations and found similarities with the DNA of people living in today's Turkey and Iraq.
37,"Along with Sumerian, Semitic languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia."
38,"Subartuan a language of the Zagros, perhaps related to the Hurro-Urartuan language family is attested in personal names, rivers and mountains and in various crafts."
39,"Akkadian came to be the dominant language during the Akkadian Empire and the Assyrian empires, but Sumerian was retained for administrative, religious, literary and scientific purposes."
40,Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babylonian period.
41,"Old Aramaic, which had already become common in Mesopotamia, then became the official provincial administration language of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and then the Achaemenid Empire: the official lect is called Imperial Aramaic."
42,"Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries."
43,The last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.
44,Early in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language.
45,"Cuneiform literally means ""wedge-shaped"", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay."
46,The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms.
47,"The earliest texts (7 archaic tablets) come from the É, a temple dedicated to the goddess Inanna at Uruk, from a building labeled as Temple C by its excavators."
48,The early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master.
49,"Thus, only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its use."
50,It was not until the widespread use of a syllabic script was adopted under Sargon's rule that significant portions of the Mesopotamian population became literate.
51,"Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated."
52,"During the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerian and the Akkadian language users, which included widespread bilingualism."
53,"The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence."
54,This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund.
55,"Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD."
56,"An old Sumerian proverb averred that ""he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn."""
57,"Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary."
58,"A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer."
59,"Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases."
60,"The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up."
61,Many Babylonian literary works are still studied today.
62,"One of the most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sîn-lēqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle."
63,Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh.
64,"The whole story is a composite product, although it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure."
65,"This is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-degree circle."
66,"The Sumerian calendar was lunisolar, with three seven-day weeks of a lunar month."
67,This form of mathematics was instrumental in early map-making.
68,The Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids.
69,"They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if π were fixed at 3."
70,"The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the area of the base and the height; however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases."
71,"The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven modern miles (11 km)."
72,"This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time."
73,"This continued to Assyrian times, when Limmu lists were created as a year by year association of events with planetary positions, which, when they have survived to the present day, allow accurate associations of relative with absolute dating for establishing the history of Mesopotamia."
74,The Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict eclipses and solstices.
75,Scholars thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy.
76,Most of these related to religion and omens.
77,Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon.
78,They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter.
79,The origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.
80,"During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy."
81,They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems.
82,This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.
83,This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.
84,"In Seleucid and Parthian times, the astronomical reports were thoroughly scientific; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain."
85,The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the history of astronomy.
88,Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch.
89,He supported Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric theory where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun.
90,"According to Plutarch, Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used (except that he correctly theorized on tides as a result of Moon's attraction)."
91,"Babylonian astronomy served as the basis for much of Greek, classical Indian, Sassanian, Byzantine, Syrian, medieval Islamic, Central Asian, and Western European astronomy."
92,"In addition, the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of therapy and aetiology and the use of empiricism, logic, and rationality in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy."
93,"If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on exorcism to cleanse the patient from any curses."
94,These include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.
95,They were also one of the first Bronze Age societies in the world.
96,"They developed from copper, bronze, and gold on to iron."
97,Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals.
98,"Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and maces."
99,"According to a recent hypothesis, the Archimedes' screw may have been used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BC, although mainstream scholarship holds it to be a Greek invention of later times."
100,"Later, during the Parthian or Sasanian periods, the Baghdad Battery, which may have been the world's first battery, was created in Mesopotamia."
101,"Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat disc, surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, heaven."
102,"They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the universe was born from this enormous sea."
103,"In addition, Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic."
104,"Although the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations."
105,"The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki."
106,"Their son was Enlil, the air god."
107,They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god.
108,He was the chief god of the pantheon.
109,"The Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?."
110,They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.
111,"Babylonian thought was axiomatic and is comparable to the ""ordinary logic"" described by John Maynard Keynes."
113,Logic was employed to some extent in Babylonian astronomy and medicine.
114,Babylonian thought had a considerable influence on early Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy.
115,"In particular, the Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the Sophists, the Heraclitean doctrine of dialectic, and the dialogs of Plato, as well as a precursor to the Socratic method."
116,The Ionian philosopher Thales was influenced by Babylonian cosmological ideas.
118,"Although music and songs amused kings, they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the marketplaces."
119,Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children.
120,Thus songs were passed on through many generations as an oral tradition until writing was more universal.
121,These songs provided a means of passing on through the centuries highly important information about historical events.
123,The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago.
124,"The image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing right-handed."
125,This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient Egypt from the 18th dynasty onwards in long- and short-neck varieties.
126,The oud is regarded as a precursor to the European lute.
129,"Boxing and wrestling feature frequently in art, and some form of polo was probably popular, with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses."
130,"They also played majore, a game similar to the sport rugby, but played with a ball made of wood."
131,"They also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, now known as the ""Royal Game of Ur""."
132,"For example, during the earliest Sumerian period, the ""en"", or high priest of male gods was originally a woman, that of female goddesses, a man."
133,"Thorkild Jacobsen, as well as many others, has suggested that early Mesopotamian society was ruled by a ""council of elders"" in which men and women were equally represented, but that over time, as the status of women fell, that of men increased."
134,"As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, went to school."
135,Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade.
136,"Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children."
137,Some children would help with crushing grain or cleaning birds.
138,"Unusually for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had rights."
139,"They could own property and, if they had good reason, get a divorce."
140,"In the city of Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions."
141,A few have been found wrapped in mats and carpets.
142,"Deceased children were put in big ""jars"" which were placed in the family chapel."
143,Other remains have been found buried in common city graveyards.
144,17 graves have been found with very precious objects in them.
145,It is assumed that these were royal graves.
146,"Rich of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun."
147,"Sumerian temples functioned as banks and developed the first large-scale system of loans and credit, but the Babylonians developed the earliest system of commercial banking."
148,The word Ensi was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture.
149,"The need for irrigation led the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers."
150,"Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, took root on tributaries of the Euphrates, while others, notably Lagash, were built on branches of the Tigris."
151,"The rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials)."
152,"Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops, portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable."
153,This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia.
154,Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts.
155,"Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley, onions, grapes, turnips, and apples."
156,Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine.
159,"Although the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities."
160,The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept.
161,"Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils, leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad, further north."
162,"Among the rivers and streams, the Sumerian people built the first cities along with irrigation canals which were separated by vast stretches of open desert or swamp where nomadic tribes roamed."
163,"Communication among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous."
164,"Thus, each Sumerian city became a city-state, independent of the others and protective of its independence."
165,"At times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries."
166,"As a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare."
167,"Eventually Sumer was unified by Eannatum, but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later."
168,The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings.
169,"The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations."
170,Most kings named themselves “king of the universe” or “great king”.
171,"Another common name was “shepherd”, as kings had to look after their people."
172,"Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad."
173,They all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.
174,Governors also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built.
175,He was also responsible for enforcing the laws.
176,"In this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire."
177,"Although Babylon was quite a small state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of Hammurabi's rule."
178,"He was known as ""the lawmaker"", and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia."
179,"It was later called Babylonia, which meant ""the gateway of the gods."""
180,It also became one of history's greatest centers of learning.
181,An early king Lugalbanda was supposed to have built the white walls around the city.
182,"As city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals."
183,These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major war—the first recording of a war occurred around 3200 BC but was not common until about 2500 BC.
184,"The later Stele of the Vultures at the end of the Early Dynastic III period  (2600–2350 BC), commemorating the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over the neighbouring rival city of Umma is the oldest monument in the world that celebrates a massacre."
185,"From this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system."
186,At times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities.
187,"This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states."
188,"When empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries."
189,"King Sargon, for example, conquered all the cities of Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern Syria."
190,Many Assyrian and Babylonian palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the enemy either desperately escaping or hiding amongst reeds.
191,The codes of Urukagina and Lipit Ishtar have been found.
192,He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia.
193,"The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculpture was also painted."
194,"The Protoliterate period, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals."
195,"The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BC, part man and part lion."
196,"A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived."
197,"Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men."
199,"It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded."
200,"The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection."
201,"They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, often the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete)."
202,Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.
203,"Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well."
204,Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.
205,"Brick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities."
206,"The ziggurat is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the Ishtar Gate from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin."
207,"The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at Uruk from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the Early Dynastic period sites in the Diyala River valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the Third Dynasty of Ur remains at Nippur (Sanctuary of Enlil) and Ur (Sanctuary of Nanna), Middle Bronze Age remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of Ebla, Mari, Alalakh, Aleppo and Kultepe, Late Bronze Age palaces at Hattusa, Ugarit, Ashur and Nuzi, Iron Age palaces and temples at Assyrian (Kalhu/Nimrud, Khorsabad, Nineveh), Babylonian (Babylon), Urartian (Tushpa/Van,  Kalesi, Cavustepe, Ayanis, Armavir, Erebuni, Bastam) and Neo-Hittite sites (Karkamis, Tell Halaf, Karatepe)."
208,Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur.
209,"Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the Iron Age."
