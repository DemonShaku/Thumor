0,"The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations."
1,"Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations."
2,"Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports."
3,Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
4,"Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft and aircraft."
5,"The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport."
6,"Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route."
7,"Governments deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies."
8,"In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode."
9,"Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private."
10,"Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items."
11,"Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land."
12,"While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl."
13,Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power.
14,"Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions."
15,"Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates."
16,"Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft."
17,"Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles."
18,"The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift."
19,A gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing.
20,Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft.
21,Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing.
22,"The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers."
23,"While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water."
24,"The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket."
26,"Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, helicopters can be used."
28,Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other.
29,Land transport is a key factor in urban planning.
30,"It consists of two kinds, rail and road."
31,"The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge."
32,The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.
33,Alternative methods include monorail and maglev.
34,A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails.
35,"Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight."
36,"The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside systems."
37,"Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit."
38,"Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines."
39,"Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships."
40,"Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities; modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially built track."
41,"Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport."
42,"Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo."
43,"Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains."
44,"Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance."
45,"Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians."
46,Road transport offers complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience.
47,"This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport."
48,It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.
49,"Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility."
50,Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.
51,"The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance."
53,The steam was produced in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam external combustion engine.
54,Now most ships have an internal combustion engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called bunker fuel.
55,"Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam."
56,"Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet."
57,"In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans."
59,"Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods."
60,Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping; short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.
62,"Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas."
63,Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source.
64,It is most commonly used at steep gradient.
65,"Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport."
66,Spaceflight is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into outer space by means of a spacecraft.
67,"While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments."
68,"However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System."
69,"Suborbital spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant ""other place"" on Earth."
70,"Faster transport could be achieved through part of a low Earth orbit, or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it."
71,"It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance."
72,"For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed."
73,"Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed."
74,"However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals."
75,"Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another."
76,"For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits."
77,"For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centres and suburbs."
78,"The terminals for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops."
79,"For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use."
80,The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private.
81,"Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through taxation."
82,New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt.
83,"Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or toll plazas on roads."
84,"Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles."
85,"Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects."
86,"Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders."
88,"Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers and pressure."
89,Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver.
90,"However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated."
91,"For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers."
92,"Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver."
93,"For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments."
94,"The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities."
95,"Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway."
97,"International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, but ports can be public-owned."
98,Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.
99,"The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible."
100,This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.
101,"However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment."
102,"Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire."
103,"The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact."
104,"Travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration."
105,Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit.
106,"The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities."
107,"Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel."
108,"Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal."
109,"Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station."
110,Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum.
111,"Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive."
112,"In the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable."
113,International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements.
114,"The word is often associated with road-going ""emergency ambulances"", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems."
115,Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes.
116,"Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft."
117,"With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport."
118,Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption.
119,"While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen."
120,"Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information."
121,Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.
122,"Containerization, with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs."
123,"Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation."
124,"Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently."
125,"The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk."
126,Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.
127,"Air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value."
128,"Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio."
129,"In addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing."
130,"Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people."
131,Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.
132,"But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue."
133,"Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities."
134,"Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport."
135,"Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed."
136,"Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns."
137,"On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain."
138,"Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities."
139,"Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering."
140,"Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity."
141,"Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all."
142,"Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization."
143,"Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport."
144,There are economies of agglomeration.
145,"Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered."
147,An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.
148,Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it.
149,"It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned."
150,"This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector."
151,"By sub-sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming."
152,"Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle."
153,Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.
154,"Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency."
155,"Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands."
156,Redirecting vehicle movement to create 20 minute neighbourhoods that promotes exercise while greatly reducing vehicle dependency and pollution.
157,Some policies are levying a congestion charge to cars for travelling within congested areas during peak time.
158,"In the 2012 United Nation's World Conference, global leaders unanimously recognized that transport and mobility are central to achieving the sustainability targets."
159,"In recent years, data has been collected to show that the transport sector contributes to a quarter of the global greenhouse gas emissions and thus, sustainable transport has been mainstreamed across several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to food, security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements."
161,"The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration."
162,"Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to time immemorial, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution."
164,"Many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, constructed paved roads."
165,"In classical antiquity, the Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly."
166,Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry.
167,The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads.
168,The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks.
169,"Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two."
170,"The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water."
171,"Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible."
172,"With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects."
173,"The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles."
174,"Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources."
178,"Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials."
180,"In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization."
182,"Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance."
