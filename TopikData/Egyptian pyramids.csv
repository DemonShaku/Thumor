0,The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.
2,Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.
3,The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid.
4,It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.
6,"Although Egyptologists often credit his vizier Imhotep as its architect, the dynastic Egyptians themselves, contemporaneously or in numerous later dynastic writings about the character, did not credit him with either designing Djoser's pyramid or the invention of stone architecture."
7,"The Pyramid of Djoser was first built as a square mastaba-like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and was expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers, to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today."
12,He gave up after only damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too large.
13,"The shape of a pyramid is also thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance."
14,Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence.
15,"For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senusret II at El Lahun was Senusret Shines."
16,"While it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them."
17,"One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of ""resurrection machine."
19,One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky.
20,A great many more have since been discovered.
23,"If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble."
24,"As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures."
25,"The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below."
26,"Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt."
27,Its location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone.
28,"Quarrying, which began in Roman times, has left little apart from about fifteen courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid's core."
29,A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.
30,"Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex."
31,"This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction – it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume."
32,The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
33,Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.
34,"The northern structure's owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet."
35,"If this attribution is correct, Khaba's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid."
37,The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty – perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy.
38,They are smaller than their predecessors and are built of low-quality local limestone.
39,"The three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best-preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure."
40,The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre.
41,"Most of the major pyramids at Abusir were built using similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mudbricks with a limestone outer casing."
42,"The largest of these Fifth Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some 70 m (230 ft) high and then later transformed into a ""true"" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry."
43,"Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt."
44,"Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II."
45,"Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser's successor Sekhemkhet, known as the Buried Pyramid."
46,"Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser's."
47,"South of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Djedkare Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi."
48,Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.
49,The Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors.
50,"His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex."
52,"The southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a ""true"" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smooth sides in its finished state, but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone."
53,"As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success – albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact."
54,As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.
55,Several kilometres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last – and most successful – of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the world's first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid.
56,"The structure is also the third-largest pyramid in Egypt, after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza."
57,"Also at Dahshur is one of two pyramids built by Amenemhat III, known as the Black Pyramid, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids."
58,The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids.
59,"One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat's cousin, Khaba II."
60,"The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of the ancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty."
61,"However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni's name has been found at the site."
62,"It was constructed as a step pyramid and then later converted into the first ""true"" smooth-sided pyramid, when the steps were filled in and an outer casing added."
63,The pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times.
64,"Medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps, although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance."
65,"The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature, it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way."
66,It is the Hawara pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place.
67,Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.
68,He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.
69,It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).
70,"Each pyramid is identified through the pharaoh who ordered it built, his approximate reign, and its location."
71,"In 2013, papyri discovered at the Egyptian desert near the Red Sea by archaeologist Pierre Tallet revealed the Diary of Merer, an official of Egypt involved in transporting limestone along the Nile River."
72,"It is possible that quarried blocks were then transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction."
73,"Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together."
