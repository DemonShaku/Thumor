0,"Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes."
1,"After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age."
2,"The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived ""natural philosophy"", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions."
3,"The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of ""natural philosophy"" to ""natural science."
4,"There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence."
5,"The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection."
6,"Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term."
7,"Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge."
8,"In particular, it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share."
9,"For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought."
10,"This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at a national scale, such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids."
11,"However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems."
12,"Metallurgy was known in prehistory, and the Vinča culture was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys."
13,It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.
14,"The ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing; they also studied animal physiology, anatomy, and behavior for divinatory purposes and made extensive records of the movements of astronomical objects for their study of astrology."
15,"Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and mainly only studied scientific subjects which had obvious practical applications or immediate relevance to their religious system."
16,"Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time."
17,"Before the invention or discovery of the concept of ""nature"" (ancient Greek phusis) by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural ""way"" in which a plant grows, and the ""way"" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god."
18,"For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish ""nature"" and ""convention."""
19,"Natural philosophy, the precursor of natural science, was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy – the realm of the first philosopher-physicists."
20,"They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy."
21,The Pythagoreans developed a complex number philosophy and contributed significantly to the development of mathematical science.
22,The theory of atoms was developed by the Greek philosopher Leucippus and his student Democritus.
23,"The Greek doctor Hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science and is known as ""The Father of Medicine""."
24,"A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was Socrates' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself."
25,The Socratic method as documented by Plato's dialogues is a dialectic method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions.
26,This was a reaction to the Sophist emphasis on rhetoric.
27,"The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs."
28,Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.
29,"Socrates was later, in the words of his Apology, accused of corrupting the youth of Athens because he did ""not believe in the gods the state believes in, but in other new spiritual beings""."
30,"In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans."
31,"Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover."
32,The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy).
33,Aristarchus's model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics.
34,"The inventor and mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus and has sometimes been credited as its inventor, although his proto-calculus lacked several defining features."
35,"Pliny the Elder was a Roman writer and polymath, who wrote the seminal encyclopedia Natural History, dealing with history, geography, medicine, astronomy, earth science, botany, and zoology."
36,"Other scientists or proto-scientists in Antiquity were Theophrastus, Euclid, Herophilos, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Galen."
37,"In contrast, the Byzantine Empire resisted the attacks from invaders, and preserved and improved upon the learning."
38,"John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws."
39,"Aristotle's four causes prescribed that the question ""why"" should be answered in four ways in order to explain things scientifically."
40,"Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic political struggles."
41,"However, the general fields of science (or ""natural philosophy"" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville."
42,"However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the Timaeus, which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages."
43,"Another original work that gained influence in this period was Ptolemy's Almagest, which contains a geocentric description of the solar system."
44,"During late antiquity, in the Byzantine empire many Greek classical texts were preserved."
45,Many Syriac translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites.
46,"They played a role when they translated Greek classical texts into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon."
47,"Al-Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world."
48,The Islamic Golden Age flourished from this time until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.
49,"Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), as well as his predecessor Ibn Sahl, was familiar with Ptolemy's Optics, and used experiments as a means to gain knowledge."
50,"Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics."
51,"Furthermore, doctors and alchemists such as the Persians Avicenna and Al-Razi also greatly developed the science of Medicine with the former writing the Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia used until the 18th century and the latter discovering multiple compounds like alcohol."
52,"Demand for Latin translations grew (for example, from the Toledo School of Translators); western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew."
53,"Manuscript copies of Alhazen's Book of Optics also propagated across Europe before 1240, as evidenced by its incorporation into Vitello's Perspectiva."
54,Avicenna's Canon was translated into Latin.
55,"In particular, the texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom and also in the Byzantine Empire, were sought amongst Catholic scholars."
56,"The influx of ancient texts caused the Renaissance of the 12th century and the flourishing of a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism in western Europe, which became a new geographic center of science."
57,"An experiment in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying."
58,One prominent scientist in this era was Roger Bacon.
59,"Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and dialectic reasoning, and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as alchemy's focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance."
60,"Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle."
61,A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.
62,Kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil.
63,He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere.
64,The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye.
65,"Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler's laws of planetary motion."
66,Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics and described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres.
67,Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics.
68,"However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system."
69,René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science.
70,Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature.
71,Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation.
72,"Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of ""simple"" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or ""formal cause"", of each complex type of thing."
73,"This new science began to see itself as describing ""laws of nature""."
74,This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic.
75,Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.
76,"Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, ""energy"" and ""potential"" (modern versions of Aristotelian ""energeia and potentia"")."
77,"This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals."
78,"In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing."
79,"It is during this period that the word ""science"" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature – coming close in meaning to the old term ""natural philosophy."""
80,"During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and inventions that would improve human lives, in the materialistic sense of having more food, clothing, and other things."
81,Societies and academies were also the backbones of the maturation of the scientific profession.
82,Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population.
83,"Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's Principia."
84,"Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry."
85,"Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors – Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally – as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day."
86,"In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded."
87,Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist.
88,When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity.
89,"His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later."
90,"The laws of conservation of energy, conservation of momentum and conservation of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources."
91,"With the advent of the steam engine and the industrial revolution, there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined in physics were not equally useful: they did not have the same energy quality."
92,"This realization led to the development of the laws of thermodynamics, in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the entropy of a closed universe increases over time."
93,"The electromagnetic theory was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework."
94,The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity.
95,"In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron."
96,"In the first half of the century, the development of antibiotics and artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible."
97,"At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of ""atomic energy"" (nuclear power)."
98,"In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race."
99,The molecular structure of DNA was discovered in 1953.
100,The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 led to a rejection of the Steady State theory of the universe in favour of the Big Bang theory of Georges Lemaître.
101,"The development of spaceflight in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including six manned landings on the Moon."
102,Space telescopes lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.
103,"Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones."
104,"In 2015, gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity a century before, were first observed."
105,Each of these branches comprises various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.
106,The relationships between the branches of science are summarized by the following table.
107,It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science.
108,These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines.
109,"Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science."
110,Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece.
111,"Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way."
112,"Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science."
113,"Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on."
114,"Today, ""natural history"" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences."
115,"It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology."
116,Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society.
117,"For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense."
118,"Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense."
119,"In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research)."
120,"The term ""social research"" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods."
121,"It includes mathematics, systems theory, and theoretical computer science."
122,"The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge."
123,"They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts."
124,"The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science."
125,"Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences."
126,"Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics."
127,"Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics."
128,Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge.
129,"Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research."
130,This leads to options for technological advances that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable.
131,"This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question ""what is the use of basic research?"""
132,"he responded: ""Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?""."
133,"For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters."
134,"Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck."
135,"An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as ""Occam's Razor"") and are generally expected to seek consilience – fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena."
136,This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation.
137,"The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred."
138,Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.
139,"This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment)."
140,Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).
141,"When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded."
142,"If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena."
143,"A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory."
144,Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses.
145,"In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses."
146,"This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions."
147,"After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be."
148,"Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias)."
149,"Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as ""perceptual consensibility."""
150,"He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge."
151,"For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested."
152,It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements.
153,"Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results."
154,"Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve."
155,"According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge."
156,The philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.
157,The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism.
158,"It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons."
159,"One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality."
160,"In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds."
161,There are different schools of thought in the philosophy of science.
162,"The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations."
163,"Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories."
164,"This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only."
165,"Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method."
166,"Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation."
167,"Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper."
168,Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation.
169,"He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it."
170,Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.
171,"Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error."
172,It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant.
173,"Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists should not make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics)."
174,"Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true."
175,"Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent ""portrait"" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing."
176,"He characterized normal science as the process of observation and ""puzzle solving"" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift."
177,"Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations."
178,"The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more ""portraits"" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising."
179,A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them.
180,"That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm."
181,"For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process."
182,Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.
183,"That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either."
184,"Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science."
185,Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.
186,"The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize."
187,"That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism."
188,The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty.
189,"""New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding."
190,"According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like ""breakthrough"" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false."
191,"While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions."
192,Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.
193,"Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community."
194,"For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name ""theory"" even though, in practice, they are considered factual."
195,"Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for ""knowledge"" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct."
198,"Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider."
199,"For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive."
200,"Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science."
201,"The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665."
202,Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased.
203,"In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500."
204,"The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences."
205,"Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace."
206,"Science magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research."
207,Science books engage the interest of many more people.
208,"Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science."
209,"Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund."
210,The crisis has long-standing roots; the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem.
211,"The replication crisis represents an important body of research in metascience, which aims to improve the quality of all scientific research while reducing waste."
212,"Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term ""cargo cult science"" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the ""kind of utter honesty"" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated."
213,"Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories."
214,"Sometimes, research may be characterized as ""bad science,"" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas."
215,"The term ""scientific misconduct"" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person."
217,"In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)."
218,Other motivations include recognition by their peers and prestige.
219,"The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award, is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics."
220,"Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work."
221,Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce.
222,"They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50–60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science."
223,"Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues, and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged."
224,"Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines."
225,"Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election."
226,"Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations."
227,Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline.
228,"Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership."
229,Scholars in the sociology of science argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.
230,Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.
231,Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.
232,"In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public."

238,"Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds."
239,"In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government."
