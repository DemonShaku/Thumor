0,"A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing, often in a quiet environment conducive to study."
1,"It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
2,"A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, table games, video games and other formats."
3,Libraries range widely in size up to millions of items.
4,"The word for ""library"" in many modern languages is derived from Ancient Greek βιβλιοθήκη (bibliothēkē), originally meaning bookcase, via Latin bibliotheca."
5,"The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC."
6,Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC.
7,"In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria."
8,The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this time and attracted scholars from all over the world.
9,"A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual."
10,"Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research."
11,"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs."
12,"Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration."
13,Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet.
14,Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources.
15,"They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources."
16,Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning.
17,"Topics of interest include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, and the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship."
18,"Since the 1960s, issues of computerization and digitization have arisen."
19,"Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky and bookmobiles, are generally of the lending type."
20,"Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises."
21,"Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility."
22,"Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part."
23,"Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities."
24,Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution.
25,"Academic libraries  house current, reliable relevant information resources spread through all the disciplines which serve to assuage the information requirements of students and faculty."
26,"Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours)."
27,"Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators."
28,"Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs."
29,"These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software."
30,"These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom."
31,"The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms."
32,"In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented."
35,"Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations."
36,"Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis, especially in the form of fully Open Access institutional publishers."
37,Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children.
38,They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading.
39,"Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading."
40,Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.
41,"Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books."
42,"Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works."
43,"There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the repository character."
44,The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.
45,"Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties."
46,The national libraries of Europe participate in The European Library which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).
47,"If the library is part of a countywide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system."
48,"A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system."
49,Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing.
50,"The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted."
51,"Typically, libraries issue library cards to community members wishing to borrow books."
52,Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.
53,"Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time."
54,"For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment."
55,"According to a study by the Pennsylvania Library Association, public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths."
56,Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
57,"As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown."
58,The stack system involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room.
59,This arrangement arose in the 19th century.
60,"Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the cast iron and steel frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty)."
61,The introduction of electrical lighting had a huge impact on how the library operated.
62,"The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks."
63,"As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space."
64,"Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature."
65,Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.
66,"Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university."
67,Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique.
68,"Many lending libraries contain a ""reference section"", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out."
69,"Such reference sections may be referred to as ""reading rooms"", which may also include newspapers and periodicals."
70,A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include primary as well as secondary sources; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials.
71,"A research library is most often an academic or national library, but a large special library may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries."
72,"A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the Association of Research Libraries."
73,"Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials."
74,Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.
75,"Examples of research libraries include the British Library, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University and the New York Public Library Main Branch on 42nd Street in Manhattan, State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science."
76,"They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably."
77,"The definition of a digital library implies that ""a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."""
78,"Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together."
79,"The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use."
80,"Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question."
81,"With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem."
82,"A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem."
83,"Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable."
84,"Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself."
85,"Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work."
86,"Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof."
87,"In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in a specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library."
88,"Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community."
89,"Libraries and the LGBTQ community have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community."
90,"Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the Women's Library @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history."
91,"Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question."
92,"Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection."
93,"Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library."
94,"Special libraries are distinguished from special collections, which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area."
95,"For more information on specific types of special libraries, see law libraries, medical libraries, music libraries, or transportation libraries."
96,"Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored."
97,These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public.
98,"Others require patrons to submit a ""stack request"", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see List of closed stack libraries (in progress)."
99,Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional librarians.
100,Circulation (or Access Services) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.
101,Collection Development – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
102,"Reference – Staffs a reference desk answering questions from users (using structured reference interviews), instructing users, and developing library programming."
103,"Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are children's literature, young adult literature, and genealogy materials."
104,Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning weeded materials.
105,Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services.
106,Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.
107,"Basic tasks in library management include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems."
108,"More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming)."
112,"This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior."
113,This can be due to individuals' unease in approaching a staff member.
114,Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use.
115,"An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness."
116,"In the public libraries of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement, which advocated library user education."
117,One of the early leaders was John Cotton Dana.
118,"Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card catalogue—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with index cards that identified books and other materials."
119,"In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room."
120,"The emergence of the Internet, however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as ""webcats"" or as online public access catalogues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access."
121,"This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as digital libraries and distributed libraries, as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted."
122,"Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing their resources across a series of shelves called bays."
123,"Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically, a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging."
124,Finland has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world.
125,Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.
126,"In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978."
128,"The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline."
129,The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries.
130,Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away.
132,"A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8 million in revenue."
133,"Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy's decision to dispense with its library of printed books—more than 20,000 volumes in all—and switch over entirely to digital media resources."
134,One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities.
135,There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library.
136,"As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased."
137,Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book.
138,"In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library."
139,"Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet."
140,"The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library."
141,"In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the GoLibrary, that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as El Cerrito del Norte BART station in California."
142,Some specialised search engines such as Google Scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers.
143,The Online Computer Library Center allows anyone to search the world's largest repository of library records through its WorldCat online database.
144,"Websites such as LibraryThing and Amazon provide abstracts, reviews, and recommendations of books."
145,Libraries provide computers and Internet access to allow people to search for information online.
146,"Due to their holdings of valuable material, some libraries are important partners for search engines such as Google in realizing the potential of such projects and have received reciprocal benefits in cases where they have negotiated effectively."
147,"As the prominence of and reliance on the Internet has grown, library services have moved the emphasis from mainly providing print resources to providing more computers and more Internet access."
148,"Libraries face a number of challenges in adapting to new ways of information seeking that may stress convenience over quality, reducing the priority of information literacy skills."
149,"The potential decline in library usage, particularly reference services, puts the necessity for these services in doubt."
150,Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.
151,This includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession.
152,"However, marketing of services has to be adequately supported financially in order to be successful."
153,"National associations of the English-speaking world include the American Library Association, the Australian Library and Information Association, the Canadian Library Association, the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa, and the Research Libraries UK (a consortium of 30 university and other research libraries in the United Kingdom)."
154,"Library bodies such as CILIP (formerly the Library Association, founded 1877) may advocate the role that libraries and librarians can play in a modern Internet environment, and in the teaching of information literacy skills."
155,The Nigerian Library Association is the recognized group for librarians working in Nigeria.
157,Public library advocacy is support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs.
158,"Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members."
159,"Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide ""economic value to the community"" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media."
160,Financing is often carried out by robbing valuable library items.
161,National and international coordination regarding military and civil structures for the protection of libraries is operated by Blue Shield International and UNESCO.
