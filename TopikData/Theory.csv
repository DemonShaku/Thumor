0,"A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking."
1,"The process of contemplative and rational thinking often is associated with such processes like observational study, research."
2,Theories may either be scientific or other than scientific (or scientific to less extent).
3,"Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works."
4,"The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings."
5,"In modern science, the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science."
6,"Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction (""falsify"") of it."
7,"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word ""theory"" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis)."
8,"Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions."
9,"Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values."
10,"A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models."
11,"In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis."
15,"A ""classical example"" of the distinction between ""theoretical"" and ""practical"" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy."
16,"These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked."
17,"As an everyday word, theoria, θεωρία, meant ""looking at, viewing, beholding"", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to contemplative or speculative understandings of natural things, such as those of natural philosophers, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans."
18,English-speakers have used the word theory since at least the late 16th century.
19,"Modern uses of the word theory derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and rational explanation of the general nature of things."
21,"In the book From Religion to Philosophy, Francis Cornford suggests that the Orphics used the word theoria to mean ""passionate sympathetic contemplation""."
22,"Pythagoras changed the word to mean ""the passionless contemplation of rational, unchanging truth"" of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence."
23,Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory.
24,"For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different."
25,"Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as nature, so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create."
26,"On the other hand, praxis involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends."
27,Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of praxis or doing.
28,"There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the arts and sciences."
29,"Theories in various fields of study are expressed in natural language, but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic."
30,"Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of rational thought or logic."
31,Theory is constructed of a set of sentences that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration.
32,"However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory."
33,"Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another."
34,"A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or observationally equivalent, and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference."
35,"The form of theories is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in model theory."
36,"When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are closed under application of certain procedures called rules of inference."
37,"A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference."
38,A theorem is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference.
39,Theories used in applications are abstractions of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems.
40,"Obvious examples include arithmetic (abstracting concepts of number), geometry (concepts of space), and probability (concepts of randomness and likelihood)."
42,"As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories."
43,"(Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.)"
44,"This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge."
45,Underdetermination is an epistemological issue about the relation of evidence to conclusions.
46,"A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a hypothesis."
47,This is called an intertheoretic reduction because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one.
48,"For instance, our historical understanding about sound, ""light"" and heat have been reduced to wave compressions and rarefactions, electromagnetic waves, and molecular kinetic energy, respectively."
49,"These terms, which are identified with each other, are called intertheoretic identities."
50,"When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely."
51,"When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an intertheoretic elimination."
52,"For instance, the obsolete scientific theory that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of caloric fluid was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it."
53,"Also, the theory that phlogiston is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen."
54,"A theorem is derived deductively from axioms (basic assumptions) according to a formal system of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms."
55,"Theories are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world."
56,"They are 'rigorously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation."
57,"Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made."
58,An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.
59,"Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources (consilience)."
60,"The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions with respect to those phenomena."
61,"Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge."
62,"Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing diseases."
63,It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.
64,Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially.
66,"Such fact-supported theories are not ""guesses"" but reliable accounts of the real world."
67,"The theory of biological evolution is more than ""just a theory."""
68,It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease.
69,Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress.
70,"But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact."
71,"The term theory is not appropriate for describing scientific models or untested, but intricate hypotheses."
72,"In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory."
73,This is called the received view of theories.
74,"In the semantic view of theories,  which has largely replaced the received view, theories are viewed as scientific models."
75,"A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a ""model of reality""), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country."
76,"In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria."
79,"One good example is classical electromagnetism, which encompasses results derived from gauge symmetry (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called Maxwell's equations."
80,"The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed ""laws of electromagnetism"", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them."
81,"Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations."
82,"Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested."
83,"For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult."
84,"As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term ""theoretical."""
85,"These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory."
86,"In the same sense, but more specifically, the word theory is an extensive, structured collection of theorems, organized so that the proof of each theorem only requires the theorems and axioms that preceded it (no circular proofs), occurs as early as feasible in sequence (no postponed proofs), and the whole is as succinct as possible (no redundant proofs)."
87,"Ideally, the sequence in which the theorems are presented is as easy to understand as possible, although illuminating a branch of mathematics is the purpose of textbooks, rather than the mathematical theory they might be written to cover."
88,"The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of ideas."
89,At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through empirical observation.
90,"A field of study is sometimes named a ""theory"" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject."
91,"These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field."
92,"Some commonly known examples include set theory and number theory; however literary theory, critical theory, and music theory are also of the same form."
93,A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories.
94,"In other words, it is a theory about theories."
95,Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems.
96,"Often the term ""political theory"" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics."
97,"Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution."
