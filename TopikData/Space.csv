338,"Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country."
339,"The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical."
342,"In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively."
343,"Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid."
344,"Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions."
346,These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.
347,"In turn, provinces are divided into municipalities."
348,"The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves."
349,"The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself."
350,"In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community."
351,The centre-right government of former prime minister José María Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999.
356,"Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States."
357,"Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India."
358,This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours.
359,The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.
362,"Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (secano), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water."
363,"They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated."
364,"The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950."
365,Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.
367,"More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn, fruit trees, and vegetables."
368,"Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses."
369,"Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land."
372,"Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products."
373,"Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983."
374,Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains.
375,"Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export."
376,"Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community."
377,The headquarters of the World Tourism Organization are located in Madrid.
378,"Spain's geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure has made the country's international tourist industry among the largest in the world."
380,Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy.
386,"The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebastián said that ""the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution."
388,"On average, the Spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world, followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV."
390,There are 47 public airports in Spain.
394,"Also, more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million."

403,"These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian."
404,"They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute."
405,"Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America."
412,Spain has been described as a de facto plurinational state.
413,The identity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity.
414,In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture.
415,"Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians, although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity."
416,"It is this last feature of ""shared identity"" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal."
417,Smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain.
418,"There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern, South Asian and Chinese origin."
420,Their origin is unclear.
421,"Historically, Sephardi Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originated in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture."
422,The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardi Jews.
427,"There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce."
428,Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast.
429,"The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer."
430,"What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs."
432,"For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners."
434,"In the North African Spanish autonomous city of Melilla, Riff Berber is spoken by a significant part of the population."
435,"Similarly, in Ceuta Darija Arabic is spoken by a significant percentage of the population."
436,"In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands, English and German are widely spoken by tourists, foreign residents, and tourism workers."
439,"In regards to the professional development education or the vocational education, there are three levels besides the university degrees: the Formación Profesional Básica (basic vocational education); the Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio or CFGM (medium level vocation education) which can be studied after studying the secondary education, and the Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior or CFGS (higher level vocational education), which can be studied after studying the post-16 education level."
440,"The health care is public, universal and free for any legal citizen of Spain."
441,"Although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class."
442,"Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law."
444,Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
446,There have been four Spanish Popes.
448,"Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement."
449,"Later, they became Doctors of the Church."
450,"The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone."
451,"The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan."
457,Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in Spanish Morocco and Western Sahara full citizenship.
458,"Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews."
463,"Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major Latin countries of Europe."
464,"Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity."
465,"Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography."
466,"The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire."
467,"These include the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees, which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the Côa Valley and Siega Verde, which is shared with Portugal, the Heritage of Mercury, shared with Slovenia and the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests, shared with other countries of Europe."
469,The Valencian chivalric romance Tirant lo Blanch written in Valencian is also remarkable.
470,"Other major plays from the medieval times were Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía, Coplas por la muerte de su padre or El Libro de buen amor (The Book of Good Love)."
472,The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture.
473,We are in the times of the Spanish Empire.

480,Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'.
481,"In the spirit of general ""Realism"", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations."
482,"The group that has become known as the Generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain."
485,"These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98."
487,"The next supposed ""generation"" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology."
490,"While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity."
491,"Salvador de Madariaga, another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the College of Europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the Liberal International."
493,"All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards."
495,"Spain is one of the countries with the most laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, and including Latin American Nobel laureates, Spanish language literature ranks among the highest in numbers of laureates."

510,"An important provincial city founded by the Romans and with an extensive Roman era infrastructure, Córdoba became the cultural capital, including fine Arabic style architecture, during the time of the Islamic Umayyad dynasty."
511,There was then an extraordinary flowering of the Gothic style that resulted in numerous instances being built throughout the entire territory.
512,"An influential style centred in Barcelona, known as modernisme, produced a number of important architects, of which Gaudí is one."
513,The International style was led by groups like GATEPAC.
