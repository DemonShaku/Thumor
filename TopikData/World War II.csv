207,"The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front."
208,"Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines."

302,"By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators."
303,"Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates."
304,"The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 per cent (for American POWs, 37 per cent), seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians."
308,"Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on."
309,"In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders."
310,"Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the ""inferior people"" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass executions."
311,"Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943."
312,"In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples."
313,"Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them."
314,"In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP."
315,"Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition."
316,"While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly."
317,"Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so."
318,"To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia."
319,"Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war)."
320,"Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery."
321,"The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide."
322,"Although guided missiles were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably target aircraft until some years after the war."
323,"Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines."
324,"Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship."
325,"In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap."
326,Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.
327,"Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second."
328,"The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics."
330,"Land warfare changed from the static front lines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms."
331,"The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon."
333,"At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications."
334,"This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat."
335,"This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France."
336,"Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used."
337,"Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I."
338,"The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings."
339,"The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces."
340,"Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine."
341,Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption.
342,"Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war."
