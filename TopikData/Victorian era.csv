13,"Her reign lasted for 63 years and seven months, a longer period than any of her predecessors."
14,The term 'Victorian' was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era.
15,"The era has also been understood in a more extensive sense as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it, in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before Victoria's accession—typically from the passage of or agitation for (during the 1830s) the Reform Act 1832, which introduced a wide-ranging change to the electoral system of England and Wales."
17,"The Act abolished many borough seats and created others in their place, as well as expanding the franchise in England and Wales (a Scottish Reform Act and Irish Reform Act were passed separately)."
20,"Her government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne, to whom she was close."

68,"The Victorian frame of mind is largely composed of their characteristic modes of thought and feeling""."
69,"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class whose increase in numbers had a significant effect on the social strata itself: cultural norms, lifestyle, values and morality."
70,Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle-class home and lifestyle.
71,"Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space."
72,The difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function.
73,"In the Victorian era, English family life increasingly became compartmentalised, the home a self-contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations."
74,"The concept of ""privacy"" became a hallmark of the middle-class life."
76,"Bourgeois existence was a world of interior space, heavily curtained off and wary of intrusion, and opened only by invitation for viewing on occasions such as parties or teas."
77,"""The essential, unknowability of each individual, and society's collaboration in the maintenance of a façade behind which lurked innumerable mysteries, were the themes which preoccupied many mid-century novelists."""
78,Three powerful forces were at work.
79,"First was the rapid rise of the middle class, in large part displacing the complete control long exercised by the aristocracy."
80,Respectability was their code—a businessman had to be trusted and must avoid reckless gambling and heavy drinking.
81,"Second, the spiritual reform closely linked to evangelical Christianity, including both the Nonconformist sects, such as the Methodists, and especially the evangelical or Low Church element in the established Church of England, typified by Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885)."
82,"It imposed fresh moralistic values on society, such as Sabbath observance, responsibility, widespread charity, discipline in the home, and self-examination for the smallest faults and needs of improvement."
83,"Starting with the anti-slavery movement of the 1790s, the evangelical moralizers developed highly effective techniques of enhancing the moral sensibilities of all family members and reaching the public at large through intense, very well organized agitation and propaganda."
84,They focused on exciting a personal revulsion against social evils and personal misbehavior.
85,"Asa Briggs points out, ""There were as many treatises on 'domestic economy' in mid-Victorian England as on political economy""The third effect came from the liberalism of philosophical utilitarians, led by intellectuals Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), James Mill (1773–1836) and his son John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)."
86,They were not moralistic but scientific.
87,"Their movement, often called ""Philosophic Radicalism,"" fashioned a formula for promoting the goal of ""progress"" using scientific rationality, and businesslike efficiency, to identify, measure, and discover solutions to social problems."
88,"The formula was an inquiry, legislation, execution, inspection, and report."
90,Evangelicals and utilitarians shared a basic middle-class ethic of responsibility and formed a political alliance.
91,"The dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement."
92,"The nonconformist conscience, as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy."
93,"In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket."
94,"In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales."
95,The political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularization of British society in the 20th century.
96,Penalties on Roman Catholics were mostly removed.
97,The Vatican restored the English Catholic bishoprics in 1850 and numbers grew through conversions and immigration from Ireland.
98,"The Oxford Movement was also occurring around this time, which would draw in new converts to the Catholic Church; among these was John Henry Newman."
99,Secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the Old Testament grew as the scientific outlooked rapidly gained ground among the better educated.
100,"""During the mid-nineteenth century, there were two distinct religious mentalities among British academics."
101,The North British school was religiously conservative and commercially engaged thanks to the influence of Presbyterianism and Calvinism.
102,"Northern English and Scottish researchers played a key role in the development of thermodynamics, which was motivated by the desire to design ever more efficient engines."
103,"By contrast, in the South, mentalities of Anglicanism, agnosticism, and even atheism were more common."
104,"Academics such as the biologist Thomas Huxley promoted ""scientific naturalism."""
105,"In the 1851 census of church attendance, non-conformists who went to chapel comprised half the attendance of Sunday services."
106,Nonconformists were focused in the fast-growing urban middle class.
107,"The two categories of this group were in addition to the evangelicals or ""Low Church"" element in the Church of England: ""Old Dissenters,"" dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, included Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Presbyterians outside Scotland; ""New Dissenters"" emerged in the 18th century and were mainly Methodists."
108,"The ""Nonconformist conscience"" of the Old group emphasized religious freedom and equality, the pursuit of justice, and opposition to discrimination, compulsion, and coercion."
109,"The New Dissenters (and also the Anglican evangelicals) stressed personal morality issues, including sexuality, temperance, family values, and Sabbath-keeping."
110,"Both factions were politically active, but until the mid-19th century, the Old group supported mostly Whigs and Liberals in politics, while the New—like most Anglicans—generally supported Conservatives."
111,"In the late 19th century, the New Dissenters mostly switched to the Liberal Party."
112,"The result was a merging of the two groups, strengthening their great weight as a political pressure group."
113,"They joined together on new issues especially regarding schools and temperance, with the latter of special interest to Methodists."
114,"They could not hold most public offices, they had to pay local taxes to the Anglican church, be married by Anglican ministers, and be denied attendance at Oxford or degrees at Cambridge."
115,Dissenters demanded the removal of political and civil disabilities that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts).
116,The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828.
117,Dissenters organized into a political pressure group and succeeded in 1828 in the repeal of some restrictions.
118,"It was a major achievement for an outside group, but the Dissenters were not finished and the early Victorian period saw them even more active and successful in eliminating their grievances."
119,"Next on the agenda was the matter of church rates, which were local taxes at the parish level for the support of the parish church building in England and Wales."
120,Only buildings of the established church received the tax money.
121,Civil disobedience was attempted but was met with the seizure of personal property and even imprisonment.
122,"The compulsory factor was finally abolished in 1868 by William Ewart Gladstone, and payment was made voluntary."
123,"While Gladstone was a moralistic evangelical inside the Church of England, he had strong support in the Nonconformist community."
124,The Marriage Act 1836 allowed local government registrars to handle marriages.
125,Nonconformist ministers in their chapels were allowed to marry couples if a registrar was present.
126,"Also in 1836, civil registration of births, deaths, and marriages was taken from the hands of local parish officials and given to local government registrars."
127,"Burial of the dead was a more troubling problem, for urban chapels had no graveyards, and Nonconformists sought to use the traditional graveyards controlled by the established church."
128,Cambridge required that for a diploma.
129,The two ancient universities opposed giving a charter to the new University of London in the 1830s because it had no such restriction.
130,"The university, nevertheless, was established in 1837, and by the 1850s Oxford dropped its restrictions."
131,In 1871 Gladstone sponsored the Universities Tests Act 1871 that provided full access to degrees and fellowships.
132,"Nonconformists (especially Unitarians and Presbyterians) played major roles in founding new universities in the late 19th century at Manchester, as well as Birmingham, Liverpool and Leeds."
133,"It was much discussed for several decades, and had its journal edited by William Stewart Ross (1844–1906) the Agnostic Journal and Eclectic Review."
134,"Interest petered out by the 1890s, and when Ross died the Journal soon closed."
135,"Ross championed agnosticism in opposition not so much to Christianity, but to atheism, as expounded by Charles Bradlaugh The term ""atheism"" never became popular."
136,Blasphemy laws meant that promoting atheism could be a crime and was vigorously prosecuted.
137,"They included John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot and Matthew Arnold."
138,"They were not necessarily hostile to Christianity, as Huxley repeatedly emphasized."
139,The literary figures were caught in something of a trap – their business was writing and their theology said there was nothing for certain to write.
140,They instead concentrated on the argument that it was not necessary to believe in God to behave in moral fashion.
141,"The scientists, on the other hand, paid less attention to theology and more attention to the exciting issues raised by Charles Darwin in terms of evolution."
142,The proof of God's existence that said he had to exist to have a marvelously complex world was no longer satisfactory when biology demonstrated that complexity could arise through evolution.
143,"Worriers repeatedly detected threats that had to be dealt with: working wives, overpaid youths, harsh factory conditions, bad housing, poor sanitation, excessive drinking, and religious decline."
144,The licentiousness so characteristic of the upper class of the late 18th and early 19th centuries dissipated.
145,The home became a refuge from the harsh world; middle-class wives sheltered their husbands from the tedium of domestic affairs.
146,"The number of children shrank, allowing much more attention to be paid to each child."
147,"Instead, they should dominate in the realm of domestic life, focused on the care of the family, the husband, the children, the household, religion, and moral behavior."
148,"Religiosity was in the female sphere, and the Nonconformist churches offered new roles that women eagerly entered."
149,"The poem was not a pure invention but reflected the emerging legal economic social, cultural, religious and moral values of the Victorian middle-class."
150,"Legally women had limited rights to their bodies, the family property, or their children."
151,"The recognized identities were those of daughter, wife, mother, and widow."
152,"Rapid growth and prosperity meant that fewer women had to find paid employment, and even when the husband owned a shop or small business, the wife's participation was less necessary."
153,"Meanwhile, the home sphere grew dramatically in size; women spent the money and decided on the furniture, clothing, food, schooling, and outward appearance the family would make."
154,"Patmore's model was widely copied – by Charles Dickens, for example."
155,"Literary critics of the time suggested that superior feminine qualities of delicacy, sensitivity, sympathy, and sharp observation gave women novelists a superior insight into stories about home family and love."
156,This made their work highly attractive to the middle-class women who bought the novels and the serialized versions that appeared in many magazines.
157,"However, a few early feminists called for aspirations beyond the home."
158,"Cheaper paper and printing technology made it easier for humans to attract mates this way, hence the birth of the Valentine card."
159,"As a result, cognitive abilities were pushed to their genetic limits, making people more intelligent and innovative than their predecessors."
160,Formal education thus became vital.
161,The public school became a model for gentlemen and public service.
162,Sunday schools and charity schools helped reduce illiteracy.
163,"In fact, throughout the course of the nineteenth century, there was a clear movement towards universal literacy, culminating in the Elementary Education Act of 1870."
164,One way to determine the literacy rate is to count those who could sign their names on their marriage registers.
165,"Using this method, it was established that literacy in England and Wales reached roughly 90% by the late nineteenth century."
166,"Statistics of literacy from this era are likely underestimates because they were based on the number of people who could write, but throughout most of the nineteenth century, people were typically taught to read before they were taught to write."
167,Literacy rates were higher in urban than rural areas.
168,"Named after the three-legged stool students had been sitting on since the fifteenth century, the Tripos included extremely challenging and highly prestigious exams whose most successful candidate for a given year was called the ""Senior Wrangler."""
169,Below the Senior and Second Wranglers were the Optimes.
170,"The exams concerned not just pure but also ""mixed"" or applied mathematics."
175,"Topics ranged widely, from number theory to mathematical physics."
176,"Candidates needed to have a firm grasp of the works of Sir Isaac Newton and Euclid of Alexandria, trigonometric identities, conic sections, compounded interest, eclipses and more."
179,"They were marked and scored separately, however, and the results of female candidates were enunciated in comparison to men's, for instance, ""between the 20th and 21st Optimes."""
181,"At that time, it was commonly thought that women were emotional creatures lacking the mental faculty to master mathematics."
182,"Thus it was big news when Philippa Fawcett was ranked ""above the Senior Wranger"" in 1890, scoring thirteen percent higher than the top male that year, Geoffrey Thomas Bennett."
183,"In fact, nursing became even more respected after the brilliant exploits of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War."
184,Her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital became a model for others.
185,"Consequently, for many middle-class young women, the prospects of being a nurse, one of the few career options open to them at the time, became much more appealing."
186,"It benefited from the introduction of electrical power, rail transport, and telegraphy."
187,"But as free-to-use libraries sprang up all around the country, people started flocking to them."
188,Authors and publishers looked for ways to cut prices and increase sales.
189,"Serialisation in periodicals, especially literary magazines though not newspapers, became popular."
190,Quality illustrations were commissioned from the reputable artists of the time as an incentive to purchase.
191,Stories from this period often included strong a moral message.
192,But it showed signs of growth and some writers decided to seize the opportunity.
193,"By the middle of the century, commercial publishers came to recognise the great potential of this market and signed deals with gifted authors to provide a plethora of reading materials to children."
194,They also took advantage of innovations such as those that enable the printing of coloured illustrations.
195,"As the middle class boomed, people had more money to spend on entertaining their children."
196,Moral messaging was de-emphasised in favor of fun.
197,Classics like the tales of the Brothers Grimm and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen made their way to the printing press.
198,"But it was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll that proved to be the most popular, alongside the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Kingsley, Jean Ingelow, and George Macdonald."
199,"By the 1880s, juvenile fiction packed with action and adventure became commonplace."
200,"Fantasy did not have a monopoly on the market for children's literature, however."
202,"As a matter of fact, the market grew so large that most of the top writers of the era wrote at least one book for children."
204,"Though it remained influential throughout the period, there was a notable resurgence of Gothic fiction in the fin de siècle, such as in Robert Louis Stevenson's novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)."
205,"Following the bicentenary of William Shakespeare in 1769, the popularity of his works steadily grew, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century."
206,Charles and Mary Lamb appeared to have anticipated this with their Tales from Shakespeare (1807).
207,"Indeed, as the British population became not just increasingly literate but also well-educated, there was growing demand for science titles."
208,Mary Somerville became an early and highly successful science writer of the nineteenth century.
210,"Arguably one of the first books in the genre of popular science, it contained few diagrams and very little mathematics."
211,It had ten editions and was translated to multiple languages.
212,"As its name suggests, it offered readers a broad overview of the physical sciences at a time when these studies were becoming increasingly distinct and specialised."
213,It was the most popular science title from the publisher John Murray until Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859).
214,"Indeed, the late nineteenth century saw a tremendous amount of technological progress, which inspired authors to write in the genre of science fiction."
216,"In some instances, science fiction inspired new technology and scientific research."
217,The researchers found that the more difficult of words were in declining usage and a negative correlation between the use of such words and completed fertility.
218,"On the other hand, simpler words entered increasingly common use, an effect of rising literacy."
219,"In another study, from 2017, researchers employed Google's Ngram Viewer, an enormous archive of scanned books, periodicals, and other printed materials dating back to the sixteenth century."
220,They found that the use of difficult vocabulary increased substantially between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s before declining steadily till the present day.
221,"Victorian Britain, like the periods before it, was interested in literature, theatre and the arts (see Aesthetic movement and Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood), and music, drama, and opera were widely attended."
222,"Michael Balfe was the most popular British grand opera composer of the period, while the most popular musical theatre was a series of fourteen comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan, although there was also musical burlesque and the beginning of Edwardian musical comedy in the 1890s."
223,Drama ranged from low comedy to Shakespeare (see Henry Irving).
224,Melodrama—literally 'musical drama'—was introduced in Revolutionary France and reached Great Britain from there during the Victorian era.
225,It was a particularly widespread and influential theatrical genre thanks to its appeal to the working-class and artisans.
226,"However, its popularity decline in the late nineteenth century."
227,The bandstand was a simple construction that not only created an ornamental focal point but also served acoustic requirements whilst providing shelter from the changeable British weather.
228,It was common to hear the sound of a brass band whilst strolling through parklands.
229,"Astley's Amphitheatre in Lambeth, London, featuring equestrian acts in a 42-foot wide circus ring, was the center of the 19th-century circus."
230,"The permanent structure sustained three fires but as an institution lasted a full century, with Andrew Ducrow and William Batty managing the theatre in the middle part of the century."
234,Fanque also stands out as a black man who achieved great success and enjoyed great admiration among the British public only a few decades after Britain had abolished slavery.
235,"Another form of entertainment involved ""spectacles"" where paranormal events, such as mesmerism, communication with the dead (by way of mediumship or channeling), ghost conjuring and the like, were carried out to the delight of crowds and participants."
236,"Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the study of birds, butterflies, seashells (malacology/conchology), beetles and wildflowers."
237,"Large numbers traveling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centers, and people like Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses."
238,"Often originating in the public schools, they exemplified new ideals of manliness."
241,"Charles Barry's architecture for the new Palace of Westminster, which had been badly damaged in an 1834 fire, was built in the medieval style of Westminster Hall, the surviving part of the building."
242,"It constructed a narrative of cultural continuity, set in opposition to the violent disjunctions of Revolutionary France, a comparison common to the period, as expressed in Thomas Carlyle's The French Revolution: A History and Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities."
243,"At its centre was the Crystal Palace, a modular glass and iron structure – the first of its kind."
244,It was condemned by Ruskin as the very model of mechanical dehumanisation in design but later came to be presented as the prototype of Modern architecture.
245,"The emergence of photography, showcased at the Great Exhibition, resulted in significant changes in Victorian art with Queen Victoria being the first British monarch to be photographed."
246,"In general, various styles of painting were popular during the Victorian period, Classicism, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Impressionism, and Post-impressionism."
247,"In 1848, Dante Rossetti and William Holman Hunt created the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood whose stated aim was to produce paintings of photographic quality, taking inspiration from a variety of sources, from the works of William Shakespeare to Mother Nature herself."
248,The growing popularity of romantic love spilled over into literature and fine arts.
251,The Times originated the practice of sending war correspondents to cover particular conflicts.
252,"Russell wrote one dispatch that highlighted the surgeons' ""inhumane barbarity"" and the lack of ambulance care for wounded troops."
253,"Its most famous editor, Charles Prestwich Scott, made the Guardian into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s."
254,The Daily Telegraph in 1856 became the first penny newspaper in London.
255,It was funded by advertising revenue based on a large audience.
256,"By 1857, Cole planned to build one with ""due regard to the principles of sound."""
259,"Furthermore, a system of routine annual holidays came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class."
260,It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices.
261,"These included sporting events, music halls, and popular theatre."
262,"By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences."
266,"Professional sports were the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf."
267,"Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics."
268,"At the time, Thomas Malthus believed this lack of growth outside Britain was due the carrying capacity of their local environments."
269,"That is, the tendency of a population to expand geometrically while resources grew more slowly, reaching a crisis (such as famine, war, or epidemic) which would reduce the population to a more sustainable size."
270,Two major contributory factors were fertility rates and mortality rates.
271,Britain was the first country to undergo the demographic transition and the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions.
272,"Economist Gary Becker argued that at first, falling fertility is due to urbanisation and lower infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children."
273,"In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children."
274,This is known as the first demographic transition.
279,"Initially, child mortality rates dropped significantly due to improved healthcare and sanitation and better nutrition, yet fertility rates remained high, leading to a population boom."
280,"Gradually, fertility rates fell as people became more affluent and had better access to contraception."
282,There were several reasons for this.
283,"One is biological: with improving living standards, a higher proportion of women were biologically able to have children."
284,Another possible explanation is social.
285,"In the 19th century, the marriage rate increased, and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly."
286,The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain.
287,One theory is that greater prosperity allowed people to finance marriage and new households earlier than previously possible.
288,"With more births within marriage, it seems inevitable that marriage rates and birth rates would rise together."
289,Birth rates were originally measured by the 'crude birth rate' – births per year divided by total population.
290,"This is indeed a crude measure, as key groups and their fertility rates are not clear."
291,It is likely to be affected mainly by changes in the age distribution of the population.
292,The Net Reproduction Rate was then introduced as an alternative measure: it measures the average fertility rate of women of child-bearing ages.
293,High rates of birth also occurred because of a lack of birth control.
294,Mainly because women lacked knowledge of birth control methods and the practice was seen as unrespectable.
295,"Moreover, it was the poor who had had an incentive to curb their fertility whereas the rich had lacked such a need due to greater wealth and lower child mortality rates."
296,This changed due to the Industrial Revolution.
297,Standards of living improved and mortality rates fell.
298,People no longer needed to have as many children as before to ensure the propagation of their genes.
299,The link between poverty and child mortality weakened.
300,"In addition, societal attitude towards contraception warmed, leading to the negative correlation between intelligence and fertility."
301,"Improvements in nutrition may also have played a role, though its importance is still debated."
302,But the nineteenth century saw dramatic technological development.
305,"Engineering prowess, especially in communication and transportation, made Great Britain the leading industrial powerhouse and trading nation of the world at that time."
307,"Excelling in the bulk movement of coal, they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces."
308,Millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before.
309,"Railways enabled mail, newspapers, periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily, quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information."
310,It was not till the two to three decades following the Second World War that substantial economic growth was seen again.
311,"In the long-term view, the mid-Victorian boom was one upswing in the Kondratiev cycle (see figure)."
312,"There was prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half."
313,"Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialisation, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of exports that produced profits for British merchants."
314,British entrepreneurs built railways in India and many independent nations.
316,"Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter."
317,"The Chartist movement peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies."
318,"The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity."
319,Employers typically were paternalistic and generally recognised the trade unions.
320,"Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia."
321,"Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes' aspirations to middle-class norms of ""respectability""."
322,"There was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free."
323,"Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal."
324,"There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism."
325,"Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, who controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military."
326,Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate.
327,"Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music."
328,The educational system was mediocre; the main universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.
330,"The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor."
331,"There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age."
332,Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise.
333,The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.
334,"In December 1844, Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers founded what is considered the first cooperative in the world."
335,"The founding members were a group of 28, around half of which were weavers, who decided to band together to open a store owned and managed democratically by the members, selling food items they could not otherwise afford."
336,"Ten years later, the British co-operative movement had grown to nearly 1,000 co-operatives."
337,"The movement also spread across the world, with the first cooperative financial institution founded in 1850 in Germany."
338,"The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms."
339,Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure.
340,"People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums."
341,"Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults."
344,"Wage rates improved steadily; real wages (after taking inflation into account) were 65 percent higher in 1901, compared to 1871."
345,"People flooded into industrial areas and commercial cities faster than housing could be built, resulting in overcrowding and lagging sanitation facilities such as fresh water and sewage."
346,"These problems were magnified in London, where the population grew at record rates."
347,"Large houses were turned into flats and tenements, and as landlords failed to maintain these dwellings, slum housing developed."
348,"In big, once handsome houses, thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room."""
349,"Significant changes happened in the British Poor Law system in England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland."
350,"These included a large expansion in workhouses (or poorhouses in Scotland), although with changing populations during the era."
351,"Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset: novelist Charles Dickens, for example, worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in a debtors' prison."
352,Reformers wanted the children in school: in 1840 only about 20 percent of the children in London had any schooling.
353,"Agile boys were employed by the chimney sweeps; small children were employed to scramble under machinery to retrieve cotton bobbins; and children were also employed to work in coal mines, crawling through tunnels too narrow and low for adults."
354,"Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or sold matches, flowers, and other cheap goods."
355,"Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building, or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid 19th century)."
356,"Working hours were long: builders might work 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants were theoretically on duty 80-hours a week."
357,"Mother bides at home, she is troubled with bad breath, and is sair weak in her body from early labour."
358,"I am wrought with sister and brother, it is very sore work; cannot say how many rakes or journeys I make from pit's bottom to wall face and back, thinks about 30 or 25 on the average; the distance varies from 100 to 250 fathom."
364,"In its first years, the Institution was dedicated to the improvement of agriculture using chemistry, prompted by trade restrictions with Europe."
365,Such practical concerns continued through the next two centuries.
366,"However, it soon became apparent that additional funding was required in order for the Institution to continue."
367,Some well-known experts were hired as lecturers and researchers.
368,"The most successful of them all was Sir Humphry Davy, whose lectures concerned a myriad of topics and were so popular that the original practical purpose of the Institution faded away."
369,"It was slow to reach Britain, however."
370,Master of Trinity College William Whewell coined the term scientist in 1833 to describe the new professional breed specialists and experts studying what was still commonly known as natural philosophy.
372,I should incline to call him a Scientist.
373,The new term signaled the recognition of the importance of empiricism and inductive reasoning.
374,But this term was slow to catch on.
376,"It was possible for a scientist to ""earn praise but not pudding,"" he wrote."
377,"Since its birth, the Royal Society of London had been a club of gentlemanly amateurs, though some of whom were the very best in their fields, people like Charles Darwin and James Prescott Joule."
379,Britain was the leading world centre for advanced engineering and technology.
380,Its engineering firms were in worldwide demand for designing and constructing railways.
381,"In many cases, from planetary science to mammalian biology, the ease of discovery since the 1700s and 1800s can be fitted to an exponentially decaying curve."
382,"But the rate of progress is also dependent on other factors, such as the number of researchers, the level of funding, and advances in technology."
383,Thus the number of new species of mammals discovered between the late 1700s and late 1800s followed grew exponentially before leveling off in the 1900s; the general shape is known as the logistic curve.
384,"In other cases, a branch of study reached the point of saturation."
385,"Despite the despondency of many Victorian-era scientists, who thought that all that remained was measuring quantities to the next decimal place and that new discoveries would not change the contemporary scientific paradigm, as the nineteenth century became the twentieth, science witnessed truly revolutionary discoveries, such as radioactivity, and basic science continued its advance, though a number of twentieth-century scientists shared the same pessimism as their late-Victorian counterparts."
386,"William Playfair, who created charts of all sorts, justified it thus, ""a man who has carefully investigated a printed table, finds, when done, that he has only a very faint and partial idea of what he has read; and that like a figure imprinted on sand, is soon totally erased and defaced."""
387,"For example, in a chart showing the relationship between population and government revenue of some European nations, he used the areas of circles to represent the geographical sizes of those nations."
388,In the same graph he used the slopes of lines to indicate the tax burden of a given population.
389,"While serving as nurse during the Crimean War, Florence Nightingale drew the first pie charts representing the monthly fatality rates of the conflict, distinguishing deaths due to battle wounds (innermost section), those due to infectious disease (outer section), and to other causes (middle section)."
391,"Her charts clearly showed that most deaths resulted from disease, which led the general public to demand improved sanitation at field hospitals."
393,Belgian sociologist and statistician Adolphe Quetelet discovered that its extremely wide applicability in his analysis of vast amounts of statistics of human physical characteristics such as height and other traits such as criminality and alcoholism.
394,"Queletet derived the concept of the ""average man"" from his studies."
395,Sir Francis Galton employed Quetelet's ideas in his research on mathematical biology.
397,"He invented what he called the ""quincunx"" to demonstrate why mixtures of normal distributions were normal."
398,"Galton noticed that the means of a particular trait in the offspring generation differed from those of the parent generation, a phenomenon now known as regression to the mean."
399,"Francis Edgeworth developed a test for statistical significance that estimated the ""fluctuations""—twice the variance in modern language—from two given means."
400,"By modern standards, however, he was extremely conservative when it comes to drawing conclusions about the significance of an observation."
402,"But this paper fell on deaf ears until William Thomson read it, realised its significance, and had it re-printed in 1850."
403,"Green's work became a source of inspiration for the Cambridge school of mathematical physicists, which included Thomson himself, George Gabriel Stokes, and James Clerk Maxwell."
404,"Green's Essay contained what became known as Green's theorem, a basic result in vector calculus, Green's identities, and the notion of Green's functions, which appears in the study of differential equations."
405,"Thomson went on to prove Stokes' theorem, which earned that name after Stokes asked students to prove in the Smith's Prize exam in 1854."
407,"Stokes' theorem generalises Green's theorem, which itself is a higher-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."
408,"The term matrix was coined by James Joseph Sylvester, a major contributor to the theory of determinants."
409,It is difficult to overestimate the value of matrix theory to modern theoretical physics.
410,"Peter Tait wrote, prophetically, that Cayley was ""forging the weapons for future generations of physicists."""
411,It was during the nineteenth century that scientists began to work out a thorough theory.
412,"In 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, French professor of mechanics Claude-Louis Navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids."
414,"In it, Stokes sought to develop a mathematical description for all known fluids that take into account viscosity, or internal friction."
415,Scientific problems thus became the impetus for the development of the subject.
416,William Rowan Hamilton advanced it in his course to construct a deductive framework for optics; he then applied the same ideas to mechanics.
417,"With an appropriate variational principle, one could deduce the equations of motion for a given mechanical or optical system."
418,"Soon, scientists worked out the variational principles for the theory of elasticity, electromagnetism, and fluid mechanics (and, in the future, relativity and quantum theory)."
419,"Whilst variational principles did not necessarily provide a simpler way to solve problems, they were of interest for philosophical or aesthetic reasons, though scientists at this time were not as motivated by religion in their work as their predecessors."
420,Hamilton's work in physics was great achievement; he was able to provide a unifying mathematical framework for wave propagation and particle motion.
421,"In light of this description, it becomes clear why the wave and corpuscle theories of light were equally able to account for the phenomena of reflection and refraction."
422,"Although the paper was read before the Society and its abstract published, Waterson's paper faced antipathy."
423,"At this time, the kinetic theory of gases was considered highly speculative as it was based on the then not-accepted atomic hypothesis."
425,"In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell published a series of papers on the subject."
426,"Unlike those of his predecessors, who were only using averages, Maxwell's papers were explicitly statistical in nature."
427,He proposed that the speeds of molecules in a gas followed a distribution.
428,"Although the speeds would cluster around the average, some molecules were moving faster or slower than this average."
429,"He showed that this distribution is a function of temperature and mathematically described various properties of gases, such as diffusion and viscosity."
430,"He predicted, surprisingly, that the viscosity of a gas is independent of its density."
431,"This was verified at once by a series of experiments Maxwell conducted with his wife, Katherine."
432,"Experimental verification of the Maxwell distribution was not obtained till 60 years later, however."
433,Such coordinates are associated with conserved momenta and as such are useful in problem solving.
434,Routh also devised a new method for solving problems in mechanics.
435,"At that time, classical mechanics in general and the three-body problem in particular captured the imagination of many talented mathematicians, whose contributions Whittaker covered in his Report."
437,It helped provide the scientific basis for the aerospace industry in the twentieth century.
438,"Despite its age, it remains in print in the early twenty-first century."
439,Brewer and amateur scientist James Prescott Joule was one of the proponents of the latter.
440,"Joule's intricate experiments—the most successful of which involved heating water with paddle wheels—making full use of his skill in temperature control as a brewer, demonstrated decisively the reality of the ""mechanical equivalent of heat."""
441,"What would later become known as the ""conservation of energy"" was pursued by many other workers approaching the subject from a variety of backgrounds, from medicine and physiology to physics and engineering."
442,"Another notable contributor to this development was the German researcher Hermann von Helmholtz, who gave an essentially Newtonian, that is, mechanical, account."
443,"William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) received the works of Joule and Helmholtz positively, embracing them as providing support for the emerging ""science of energy."""
445,"Indeed, the commercial value of new science had already become apparent by this time; some businessmen were quite willing to offer generous financial support for researchers."
446,"Rankine spoke confidently of the new science of thermodynamics, a term Kelvin coined in 1854, whose fundamental principles came to be known as the First and Second Laws and whose core concepts were ""energy"" and ""entropy."""
447,Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait's Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867) was an attempt to reformulate physics in terms of energy.
448,"Here, Kelvin and Tait introduced the phrase kinetic energy (instead of 'actual'), now in standard usage."
449,"Natural ice was vigorously traded in the early nineteenth century, but it was inevitably in short supply, especially in Australia."
450,"During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was considerable commercial incentive to develop ever more effective refrigerators thanks to the expansion of agriculture in the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand and rapid urbanization in Western Europe."
451,"From the 1830s onward, refrigerators relied on the expansion of compressed air or the evaporation of a volatile liquid; evaporation became the basis of all modern refrigerator designs."
452,Scientists began trying to reach ever lower temperatures and to liquefy every gas they encountered.
453,This paved the way for the development of low-temperature physics and the Third Law of Thermodynamics.
454,Research in geology and evolutionary biology naturally led to the question of how old the Earth was.
456,"With the advent of thermodynamics, it became clear that the Earth and the Sun must have an old but finite age."
457,"Whatever the energy source of the Sun, it must be finite, and since it is constantly dissipating, there must be a day when the Sun runs out of energy."
459,He reached comparable figures for the Earth.
460,"The missing ingredient here was radioactivity, which was not known to science till the end of the nineteenth century."
461,Michael Faraday set himself to the task of clarifying the nature of electricity and magnetism by experiments.
462,"In doing so, he devised what could be described as the first electric motor (though it does not resemble a modern one), a transformer (now used to step up the voltage and step down the current or vice versa), and a dynamo (which contains the basics of all electric turbine generators)."
463,The practical value of Faraday's research on electricity and magnetism was nothing short of revolutionary.
464,A dynamo converts mechanical energy into an electrical current whilst a motor does the reverse.
465,"The world's first power plants entered service in 1883, and by the following year, people realized the possibility of using electricity to power a variety of household appliances."
466,"Drawing on the work of his predecessors, especially the experimental research of Michael Faraday, the analogy with heat flow by Lord Kelvin, and the mathematical analysis of George Green, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized all that was known about electricity and magnetism into a single mathematical framework, Maxwell's equations."
467,"Maxwell used his equations to predict the existence of electromagnetic waves, which travel at the speed of light."
468,"In other words, light is but one kind of electromagnetic wave."
469,"Maxwell's theory predicted there ought to be other types, with different frequencies."
470,"After some ingenious experiments, Maxwell's prediction was confirmed by German physicist Heinrich Hertz."
471,"In the process, Hertz generated and detected what are now called radio waves and built crude radio antennas and the predecessors of satellite dishes."
472,"Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz derived, using suitable boundary conditions, Fresnel's equations for the reflection and transmission of light in different media from Maxwell's equations."
473,He also showed that Maxwell's theory succeeded in illuminating the phenomenon of light dispersion where other models failed.
474,"John William Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) and the American Josiah Willard Gibbs then proved that the optical equations derived from Maxwell's theory are the only self-consistent description of the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light consistent with experimental results."
475,"Maxwell originally wrote down a grand total of 20 equations for the electromagnetic field, which he later reduced to eight."
476,"Heaviside rewrote them in the form commonly used today, just four expressions."
477,"In addition, Heaviside was responsible for considerable progress in electrical telegraphy, telephony, and the study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves."
478,"Independent of Gibbs, Heaviside assembled a set of mathematical tools known as vector calculus to replace the quaternions, which were in vogue at the time but which Heaviside dismissed as ""antiphysical and unnatural."
479,"""Faraday also investigated how electrical currents affected chemical solutions."
480,His experiments led him to the two laws of electrochemistry.
481,"Together with Whewell, Faraday introduced the basic vocabulary for the subject, the words electrode, anode, cathode, electrolysis, electrolyte, ion, anion, and cation."
482,They remain in standard usage.
483,But Faraday's work was of value to more than just chemists.
484,"In his Faraday Memorial Lecture in 1881, the German Hermann von Helmholtz asserted that Faraday's laws of electrochemistry hinted at the atomic structure of matter."
485,"While the Germans thought cathode rays were waves, the British and the French believed they were particles."
487,"In addition, because the ratio was the same regardless of the metal used, Thompson concluded that electrons must be a constituent of all atoms."
488,"Although the atoms of each chemical elements have different numbers of electrons, all electrons are identical."
489,"His stated goal was to ""investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of logical and construct its methods."""
490,"In fact, it can be traced all the way back to the Hellenistic Civilization."
491,"While people have devised such machines over the centuries, mathematicians continued to perform calculations by hand, as machines offered little advantage in speed."
492,"For complicated calculations, they employed tables, especially of logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which were computed by hand."
493,"But right in the middle of the Industrial Revolution in England, Charles Babbage thought of using the all-important steam engine to power a mechanical computer, the Difference Engine."
494,"Unfortunately, whilst Babbage managed to secure government funds for the construction of the machine, the government subsequently lost and interest and Babbage faced considerable troubles developing the necessary machine components."
495,"He abandoned the project to pursue a new one, his Analytical Engine."
497,"Like a modern computer, it consisted of two basic parts, one that stores the numbers to be processed (the store), and one that performed the operations (the mill)."
498,"Babbage adopted the concept of punch cards from the French engineer Joseph Jacquard, who had used it to automate the textile industry in France, to control the operations of his Analytical Engine."
499,"Unfortunately, he again lacked the financial resources to build it, and so it remained a theoretical construct."
500,Ada Lovelace translated the notes published by one of the attendees into English and heavily annotated it.
501,"She wrote down the very first computer program, in her case one for computing the Bernoulli numbers."
502,It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
503,It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.
504,But it is likely to exert an indirect and reciprocal influence on science itself in another manner.
505,"It is however pretty evident, on general principles, that in devising for mathematical truths a new form in which to record and throw themselves out for actual use, views are likely to be induced, which should again react on the more theoretical phase of the subject."
506,"This technology, which predates the Victorian era, had a long a rich history."
508,"International trade and travel boosted demand, and there was intense competition among the shipping companies."
509,"Steam ships such as the SS Great Britain and SS Great Western made international travel more common but also advanced trade, so that in Britain it was not just the luxury goods of earlier times that were imported into the country but essentials and raw materials such as corn and cotton from the United States and meat and wool from Australia."
511,"Even when she was finally broken up for scraps in 1888, she was still the largest ship in the world."
512,"Her record was not broken till the Edwardian era with super liners like the Lusitania in 1907, the Titanic in 1912."
513,"Yet despite being a remarkable feat of engineering, the Great Eastern became more and more of a white elephant as smaller and faster ships were in greater demand."
514,"Nevertheless, she gained a new lease of life when she was chartered to lay telegraphic cables across the Atlantic, and then to India."
515,"For that reason, it deployed the Royal Navy to protect maritime trade routes and financed the construction of many steam ships."
516,"In 1837, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone invented a telegraphic system that used electrical currents to deflect magnetic needles, thus transmitting coded messages."
517,"This design soon made its way all across Britain, appearing in every town and post office."
519,"In 1866, the SS Great Eastern successfully laid the transatlantic telegraphic cable."
520,"Like the telegraph, the telephone enabled rapid personal communication."
522,"Receiving little support in his native Italy, Guglielmo Marconi moved to England and adapted Hertz's equipment for this purpose in the 1890s."
523,"He achieved the first international wireless transmission between England and France in 1900 and by the following year, he succeeded in sending messages in Morse code across the Atlantic."
524,"Seeing its value, the shipping industry adopted this technology at once."
525,Radio broadcasting became extremely popular in the twentieth century and remains in common use in the early twenty-first.
526,"The new railways all allowed goods, raw materials, and people to be moved about, rapidly facilitating trade and industry."
527,The financing of railways became an important specialty of London's financiers.
528,They retained an ownership share even while turning over management to locals; that ownership was largely liquidated in 1914–1916 to pay for the World War.
529,"Railroads originated in England because industrialists had already discovered the need for inexpensive transportation to haul coal for the new steam engines, to supply parts to specialized factories, and to take products to market."
530,The existing system of canals was inexpensive but was too slow and too limited in geography.
532,"The engineers and businessmen needed to create and finance a railway system were available; they knew how to invent, to build, and to finance a large complex system."
533,The first quarter of the 19th century involved numerous experiments with locomotives and rail technology.
535,"On his first run, his locomotive pulled 38 freight and passenger cars at speeds as high as 12 miles per hour."
536,Brassey took thousands of British engineers and mechanics across the globe to build new lines.
537,"They invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges."
538,"Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914."
541,"The canal companies, unable or unwilling to upgrade their facilities to compete with railways, used political power to try to stop them."
542,"The railways responded by purchasing about a fourth of the canal system, in part to get the right of way, and in part to buy off critics."
545,"By 1850, rates had fallen to a penny a ton mile for coal, at speeds of up to fifty miles an hour."
546,"Britain now had had the model for the world in a well integrated, well-engineered system that allowed fast, cheap movement of freight and people, and which could be replicated in other major nations."
547,"The railways directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, mechanics, repairmen and technicians, as well as statisticians and financial planners."
548,They developed new and more efficient and less expensive techniques.
549,"Most important, they created a mindset of how technology could be used in many different forms of business."
550,Railways had a major impact on industrialization.
551,"By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railroad system itself."
552,"Parts of the first such railway, the Metropolitan Line, opened to the public in 1863, thereby becoming the first subway line in the world."
554,"That same year, the whole system became officially known as the Tube after the shape of the rail tunnels."
557,The system was overbuilt and much too elaborate and expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried.
558,"However, it did capture the imagination of the Indians, who saw their railways as the symbol of an industrial modernity—but one that was not realized until a century or so later."
559,"The model town of Saltaire was founded, along with others, as a planned environment with good sanitation and many civic, educational and recreational facilities, although it lacked a pub, which was regarded as a focus of dissent."
560,"Although initially developed in the early years of the 19th century, gas lighting became widespread during the Victorian era in industry, homes, public buildings and the streets."
561,The invention of the incandescent gas mantle in the 1890s greatly improved light output and ensured its survival as late as the 1960s.
562,Hundreds of gasworks were constructed in cities and towns across the country.
564,Medicine progressed during Queen Victoria's reign.
565,"In fact, medicine at the start of the nineteenth century was little different from that in the medieval era whereas by the end of the century, it became a lot closer to twenty-first century practice thanks to advances in science, especially microbiology, paving the way for the germ theory of disease."
566,"This was during the height of the Industrial Revolution, and urbanisation occurred at a frantic pace."
568,"He asked that the pump's handle be replaced, after which the epidemic petered out."
569,"Snow also discovered that households whose water supplies came from companies that used the Thames downstream, after many sewers had flown into the river, were fourteen times more likely to die from cholera."
570,A great engineering feat in the Victorian Era was the sewage system in London.
573,Many problems were encountered but the sewers were completed.
574,"After this, Bazalgette designed the Thames Embankment which housed sewers, water pipes and the London Underground."
575,"Using his political influence, he garnered support for the Public Health Act of 1875, which focused on preventative measures in housing, the water supply, sewage and drainage, providing Britain with an extensive public health system."
576,"By mid-century, the stethoscope became an oft-used device and designs of the microscope had advanced enough for scientists to closely examine pathogens."
577,The pioneering work of French microbiologist Louis Pasteur from the 1850s earned widespread acceptance for the germ theory of disease.
578,It led to the introduction antiseptics by Joseph Lister in 1867 in the form of carbolic acid (phenol).
579,"He instructed the hospital staff to wear gloves and wash their hands, instruments, and dressings with a phenol solution and in 1869, he invented a machine that would spray carbolic acid in the operating theatre during surgery."
581,"Chloroform was favoured by doctors and hospital staff because it is much less flammable than ether, but critics complained that it could cause the patient to have a heart attack."
582,Chloroform gained in popularity in England and Germany after John Snow gave Queen Victoria chloroform for the birth of her eighth child (Prince Leopold).
584,"At the same time sugar consumption in the British diet increased, greatly increasing instances of tooth decay."
585,"As a result, more and more people were having teeth extracted and needing dentures."
586,"This gave rise to ""Waterloo Teeth"", which were real human teeth set into hand-carved pieces of ivory from hippopotamus or walrus jaws."
587,"Its medical value was realised immediately, and within a year, doctors were prescribing X-rays for diagnosis, in particular to locate bone fractures and foreign objects inside the patient's body."
588,Urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem.
589,"Moreover, while some diseases, such as cholera, were being driven out, others, such as sexually transmitted diseases, made themselves felt."
590,The changes in moral standards and actual behaviour across the British were profound.
592,Historians continue to debate the various causes of this dramatic change.
593,"Asa Briggs emphasizes the strong reaction against the French Revolution, and the need to focus British efforts on its defeat and not be diverged by pleasurable sins."
594,"Briggs also stresses the powerful role of the evangelical movement among the Nonconformists, as well as the Evangelical faction inside the established Church of England."
595,There is a debate whether the working classes followed suit.
596,Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births.
599,"Slowly capital punishment was replaced by transportation, first to the American colonies and then to Australia, and, especially, by long-term incarceration in newly built prisons."
600,"As one historian points out, ""Public and violent punishment which attacked the body by branding, whipping, and hanging was giving way to reformation of the mind of the criminal by breaking his spirit, and encouraging him to reflect on his shame, before labour and religion transformed his character."""
601,"Crime rates went up, leading to calls for harsher measures to stop the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system."
602,"The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'."
603,"As the prisons grew more numerous, they became more depraved."
606,"By the Victorian era, penal transportation to Australia was falling out of use since it did not reduce crime rates."
607,"The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods."
608,The reforms were controversial and contested.
614,Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason.
616,"The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, the chair of the Prison Commission."
617,"Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely, but in his landmark study, Prostitution, William Acton reported an estimation of 8,600 prostitutes in London alone in 1857."
618,The differing views on prostitution have made it difficult to understand its history.
619,Judith Walkowitz has multiple works focusing on the feminist point of view on the topic of prostitution.
620,"Many sources blame economic disparities as leading factors in the rise of prostitution, and Walkowitz writes that the demographic within prostitution varied greatly."
621,"However, women who struggled financially were much more likely to be prostitutes than those with a secure source of income."
622,Orphaned or half-orphaned women were more likely to turn to prostitution as a means of income.
623,"While overcrowding in urban cities and the amount of job opportunities for females were limited, Walkowitz argues that there were other variables that lead women to prostitution."
624,Walkowitz acknowledges that prostitution allowed for women to feel a sense of independence and self-respect.
625,"Although many assume that pimps controlled and exploited these prostitutes, some women managed their own clientele and pricing."
626,"It is evident that women were exploited by this system, yet Walkowitz says that prostitution was often their opportunity to gain social and economic independence."
627,"While there were plenty of people publicly denouncing prostitution in England, there were also others who took opposition to them."
628,One event that sparked a lot of controversy was the implementation of the Contagious Diseases Acts.
630,"If the suspected woman was found with a venereal disease, they placed the woman into a Lock Hospital."
631,Arguments made against the acts claimed that the regulations were unconstitutional and that they only targeted women.
633,"Because women were excluded from the first National Association, the Ladies National Association was formed."
634,The leader of that organization was Josephine Butler.
635,Butler was an outspoken feminist during this time who fought for many social reforms.
