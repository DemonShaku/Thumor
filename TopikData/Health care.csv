0,"Health care, health-care, or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people."
1,Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields.
2,"Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care."
3,"It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health."
4,"Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies."
5,"Providing health care services means ""the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes""."
7,"Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates)."
8,Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations.
9,Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world.
10,"An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions."
11,"This includes professionals in medicine, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery and allied health, along with many others such as public health practitioners, community health workers and assistive personnel, who systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services."
12,"While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care."
13,Health care can be defined as either public or private.
14,"Such a professional would usually be a primary care physician, such as a general practitioner or family physician."
15,"Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a physiotherapist, or a non-physician primary care provider such as a physician assistant or nurse practitioner."
16,"Depending on the locality, health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a pharmacist or nurse."
17,"Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may be referred for secondary or tertiary care."
18,Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community.
19,"It can be provided in different settings, such as Urgent care centers that provide same-day appointments or services on a walk-in basis."
20,"Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal health, and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, mental and social health issues, including multiple chronic diseases."
21,"Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas."
22,"Continuity is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and preventive care, health education, and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem."
23,"Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations."
24,"Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office."
25,Examples of direct primary care practices include Foundation Health in Colorado and Qliance in Washington.
26,"In context of global population aging, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries."
27,The World Health Organization attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive primary health care strategy.
28,This care is often found in a hospital emergency department.
29,"However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals."
30,Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals.
31,This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group health insurance plans.
32,"In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred."
33,"In other countries patient self-referral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from private insurance schemes or national health insurance."
34,"Allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and dietitians, also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral."
35,Experimental medicine and some types of uncommon diagnostic or surgical procedures are considered quaternary care.
36,These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.
37,"They include many interventions of public health interest, such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases."
38,"They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of self-care, home care, long-term care, assisted living, treatment for substance use disorders among other types of health and social care services."
39,Community rehabilitation services can assist with mobility and independence after the loss of limbs or loss of function.
40,"This can include prostheses, orthotics, or wheelchairs."
41,"Many countries, especially in the west, are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes."
42,There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor's appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being.
43,"Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts."
44,"This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media."
45,"As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and ""other human health activities."""
46,"The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates or other allied health professions."
47,"In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard and the Industry Classification Benchmark, health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including biotechnology, diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery."
48,"For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States."
49,"The United States dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for three-quarters of the world's biotechnology revenues."
50,"Many important advances have been made through health research, biomedical research and pharmaceutical research, which form the basis for evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in health care delivery."
51,"Health care research frequently engages directly with patients, and as such issues for who to engage and how to engage with them become important to consider when seeking to actively include them in studies."
52,Results from health services research often form the basis of evidence-based policy in health care systems.
53,"Health services research is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low-burden, low-cost, built into standard procedures, and involve the patient."
54,"Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on healthcare."
55,"For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on healthcare."
56,A similar correlation is seen from the analysis carried out each year by Bloomberg.
57,"Clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health system's performance, but equally, the notion that more funding is better is not supported."
58,"All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and Mexico."
60,"In the United States, where around 18% of GDP is spent on health care, the Commonwealth Fund analysis of spend and quality shows a clear correlation between worse quality and higher spending."
61,"In particular, the practice of health professionals and the operation of health care institutions is typically regulated by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of quality assurance."
62,Most countries have credentialing staff in regulatory boards or health departments who document the certification or licensing of health workers and their work history.
