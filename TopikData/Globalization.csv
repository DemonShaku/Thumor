0,"Globalization, or globalisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide."
1,Globalization has accelerated since the 18th century due to advances in transportation and communication technology.
2,This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade and the exchange of ideas and culture.
3,Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that is associated with social and cultural aspects.
4,"However, disputes and diplomacy are also large parts of the history of globalization, and of modern globalization."
5,"Economically, globalization involves goods, services, data, technology, and the economic resources of capital."
6,The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds.
7,Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible.
8,"The term globalization first appeared in the early 20th century (supplanting an earlier French term mondialization), developed its current meaning some time in the second half of the 20th century, and came into popular use in the 1990s."
9,"Environmental challenges such as global warming, cross-boundary water and air pollution, and over-fishing have been linked to globalization."
10,"Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, sociocultural resources, and the natural environment."
11,"Academic literature commonly divides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization."
12,"Over the next few decades, the term was occasionally used by other scholars and media, but it was not clearly defined."
13,"One of the first usages of the term in the meaning resembling the later, common usage was by French economist François Perroux in his essays from the early 1960s (in his French works he used the term mondialization (literary worldization), also translated as mundialization)."
14,Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onward.
16,"To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood."
17,All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.
21,"In The Consequences of Modernity, Anthony Giddens writes: ""Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."""
22,"In 1992, Roland Robertson, professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field, described globalization as ""the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."
24,"Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional."
25,At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions.
26,Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents.
27,"Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term."
28,"It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world."
30,"Manfred Steger, professor of global studies and research leader in the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University, identifies four main empirical dimensions of globalization: economic, political, cultural, and ecological."
31,A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four.
32,"They note the term was used ""in education to describe the global life of the mind""; in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market, and in journalism to describe how the ""American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance""."
33,They have also argued that four forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.
34,"According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people."
35,"A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and polities, including imperial agents."
36,"Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of commodities and other objects of exchange."
37,"He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization."
38,"He used ""political globalization"" to refer to the emergence of a transnational élite and a phasing out of the nation-state."
39,"Meanwhile, he used ""cultural globalization"" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture."
40,"""Globophobia"" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the fear of balloons."
41,Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.
42,"The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East."
43,"Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did."
45,"The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe."
46,"With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity."
47,"Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur."
48,"The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity."
49,"If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other."
50,"This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to work."
51,This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization.
52,"Because it predated the Great Divergence in the nineteenth century, where Western Europe pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed Old World centers such as Gujarat, Bengal, coastal China, and Japan."
53,The German historical economist and sociologist Andre Gunder Frank argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley Civilization in the third millennium BCE.
54,"This archaic globalization existed during the Hellenistic Age, when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of Greek culture that reached from India to Spain, including Alexandria and the other Alexandrine cities."
55,"Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade."
56,Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.
57,"Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, Indian subcontinent, Persia, Europe, and Arabia, opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them."
58,"Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also traveled along the Silk Routes."
59,"In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilisations along its network."
60,"The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, missionaries, robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, languages, and new technologies."
61,"The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high ""modern globalization"" in the late 19th century."
62,"This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 15th and 17th centuries, first the Portuguese Empire (1415) followed by the Spanish Empire (1492), and later the Dutch and British Empires."
63,"The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years' War, and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly slave trade."
64,The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere.
65,"European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region."
66,Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
67,"New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires."
68,Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities.
69,"In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transportation significantly and railroads made inland transportation cheaper."
70,The transportation revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.
71,More nations embraced international trade.
72,Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia.
73,"Initially, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions."
74,"GATT's successor was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process."
75,The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiation.
76,"Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement."
77,"Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to middle classes in developed countries."
78,Open skies policies and low-cost carriers have helped to bring competition to the market.
79,"In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between countries."
80,More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location.
81,"This included accounting, software development, and engineering design."
82,"Student exchange programs became popular after World War II, and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons."
83,Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.
84,"Since the 1980s, modern globalization has spread rapidly through the expansion of capitalism and neoliberal ideologies."
85,"The implementation of neoliberal policies has allowed for the privatization of public industry, deregulation of laws or policies that interfered with the free flow of the market, as well as cut-backs to governmental social services."
86,These neoliberal policies were introduced to many developing countries in the form of structural adjustment programs (SAPs) that were implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
87,"These programs required that the country receiving monetary aid would open its markets to capitalism, privatize public industry, allow free trade, cut social services like healthcare and education and allow the free movement of giant multinational corporations."
88,These programs allowed the World Bank and the IMF to become global financial market regulators that would promote neoliberalism and the creation of free markets for multinational corporations on a global scale.
89,"In the late 19th and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly."
90,"This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the Cold War, but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s."
91,The revolutions of 1989 and subsequent liberalization in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness.
92,The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process.
93,"In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled."
94,Most migration occurred between the developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs).
95,As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.
96,The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world – it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market.
97,"It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights."
98,Growth of globalization has never been smooth.
99,"Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market."
100,"Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon."
101,Economic globalization comprises: globalization of production; which refers to the obtainment of goods and services from a particular source from locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.
102,"Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace."
103,An example of such standard is the intermodal container.
104,"Containerization dramatically reduced the costs of transportation, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization."
105,"International standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization, which is composed of representatives from various national standards organizations."
106,"A multinational corporation, or worldwide enterprise, is an organization that owns or controls the production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country."
107,Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers –  import quotas and tariffs –  and to increase trade of goods and services with each other.
108,"If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border."
109,"Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the European Union, a politico-economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe."
110,The EU has developed European Single Market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states.
111,"EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market,Trade facilitation looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximize efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives."
112,Global trade in services is also significant.
113,He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.
114,Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.
115,One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.
116,"This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six countries, each contributing to a part of the production process."
117,"This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel."
118,This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe.
119,The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders.
120,The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level.
121,Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities.
122,Intercultural communication is a related field of study.
123,"Cultural diffusion is the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages etc."
124,"Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities."
125,"For example, sushi is available in Germany as well as Japan, but Euro-Disney outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for ""authentic"" French pastry."
126,"Globalization's contribution to the alienation of individuals from their traditions may be modest compared to the impact of modernity itself, as alleged by existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus."
127,"Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television."
128,"Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and more recently sects such as Mormonism are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins."
129,Globalization has strongly influenced sports.
130,"For example, the modern Olympic Games has athletes from more than 200 nations participating in a variety of competitions."
131,Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions.
132,Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage.
133,"Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for authenticity and to preserve local musical traditions."
134,Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments.
135,Music genres such as jazz and reggae began locally and later became international phenomena.
136,Globalization gave support to the world music phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.
137,"Though the term ""World Music"" was originally intended for ethnic-specific music, globalization is now expanding its scope such that the term often includes hybrid subgenres such as ""world fusion"", ""global fusion"", ""ethnic fusion"", and worldbeat."
138,Bourdieu claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity.
139,"Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes."
140,"These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior."
141,The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization.
142,"In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US."
143,"Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America."
144,Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America.
145,"Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries."
146,Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures.
147,"As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture."
148,"Transcultural is in turn described as ""extending through all human cultures"" or ""involving, encompassing, or combining elements of more than one culture""."
149,"That system includes national governments, their governmental and intergovernmental organizations as well as government-independent elements of global civil society such as international non-governmental organizations and social movement organizations."
150,One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the nation-state and the rise of other actors on the political scene.
151,Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.
152,It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.
153,Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states.
154,"Multiple citizenship, also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality, is a person's citizenship status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states."
155,"Increasingly, non-governmental organizations influence public policy across national boundaries, including humanitarian aid and developmental efforts."
156,"Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Accion International, the Acumen Fund (now Acumen) and the Echoing Green have combined the business model with philanthropy, giving rise to business organizations such as the Global Philanthropy Group and new associations of philanthropists such as the Global Philanthropy Forum."
157,The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.
158,"For example, the North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do."
159,Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter.
160,Citizens cannot freely leave the country.
161,"Despite a large proportion of women workers in the garment industry, women are still heavily underemployed compared to men."
162,Most women that are employed in the garment industry come from the countryside of Bangladesh triggering migration of women in search of garment work.
163,It is still unclear as to whether or not access to paid work for women where it didn't exist before has empowered them.
164,The answers varied depending on whether it is the employers perspective or the workers and how they view their choices.
165,Women workers did not see the garment industry as economically sustainable for them in the long run due to long hours standing and poor working conditions.
166,"Although women workers did show significant autonomy over their personal lives including their ability to negotiate with family, more choice in marriage, and being valued as a wage earner in the family."
167,Women in the maquiladora industry have produced high levels of turnover not staying long enough to be trained compared to men.
168,A gendered two tiered system within the maquiladora industry has been created that focuses on training and worker loyalty.
169,"Women are seen as being untrainable, placed in un-skilled, low wage jobs, while men are seen as more trainable with less turnover rates, and placed in more high skilled technical jobs."
170,The idea of training has become a tool used against women to blame them for their high turnover rates which also benefit the industry keeping women as temporary workers.
171,"Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization and political globalization."
172,The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century.
173,"As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century."
174,"For example, travel across the Atlantic ocean used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days."
175,"Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable."
176,Tourism is travel for pleasure.
177,"The developments in technology and transportation infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable."
178,At any given moment half a million people are in the air.
179,International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.
180,"A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country."
183,International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development.
184,"For example, freedom of movement for workers in the European Union means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country."
185,Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in international education.
186,More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.
187,"A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to citizenship and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships."
188,"In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries."
189,Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.
190,Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century.
191,The electric telegraph was the first method of instant long-distance communication.
192,"For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean."
193,"The first transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day."
194,Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866.
195,The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.
196,The Internet has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries.
197,in different parts of the world are interrelated.
198,"possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."""
199,More than 180 countries have reported cases since then.
200,"This has caused a detrimental impact on the global economy, particularly for SME's and Microbusinesses with unlimited liability/self-employed, leaving them vulnerable to financial difficulties, increasing the market share for oligopolistic markets as well as increasing the barriers of entry."
201,"Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), portfolio investment, and income."
202,"It shows that the depth of global integration fell by about one-tenth after 2008, but by 2013 had recovered well above its pre-crash peak."
203,The report also found a shift of economic activity to emerging economies.
204,Philosophical differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of ideologies and social movements.
205,Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures.
206,Xenophobia is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.
207,"Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity."
208,Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs.
209,"They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the Gini coefficient or the Happy Planet Index, and point to a ""multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"" which they claim are the unintended consequences of globalization."
210,A 2005 study by Peer Fis and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior.
211,"In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one."
212,The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999.
213,"In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably."
214,"The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists."
215,Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004.
216,The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts.
217,Social spending was much higher than in the US.
218,"Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization."
219,"When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad."
220,"At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers."
221,Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.
222,"Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization."
223,"Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents."
224,The situation changed after the financial crisis of 2007.
227,"However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials."
228,Anxiety over their position caused terms such as internationalization and globalization to enter everyday language.
229,Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.
230,Opponents consider governments as agents of neo-colonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations.
231,Much of this criticism comes from the middle class; the Brookings Institution suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile low-income groups as threatening to their economic security.
232,"Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society."
233,"In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that ""freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment."""
234,"Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both ""winner"" and ""loser"" will increase with the ""winner"" gaining more than the ""loser"" but both gaining more than before in an absolute level."
235,"In the book The End of Poverty, Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government corruption; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as AIDS and malaria; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; protectionism; and geographic barriers."
236,"However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist."
237,Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth.
238,"Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities ""by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health;"" effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap."
239,Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization.
240,He argues that many of them lack a basic understanding of comparative advantage and its importance in today's world.
241,The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge.
242,An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.
243,"Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization."
244,"Like this, the British economic journalist Martin Wolf says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty."
245,"Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality."
246,"According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions."
247,"Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes."
248,"Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor."
249,"Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole."
250,"This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial."
