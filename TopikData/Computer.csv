0,A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
1,"Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs."
2,These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
3,"A ""complete"" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for ""full"" operation can be referred to as a computer system."
4,"This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster."
5,Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.
6,"This includes simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones."
7,The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
8,Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
9,"Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations."
10,"Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms."
11,More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
12,The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.
14,"The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries."
15,"Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips."
16,"The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information."
19,Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
20,"This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations."
21,The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century.
22,During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.
24,"The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that the ""modern use"" of the term, to mean ""programmable digital electronic computer"" dates from ""1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine""."
25,The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick.
27,"which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers."
28,The use of counting rods is one example.
29,The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
30,The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC.
31,"Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented."
32,"In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money."
33,It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
34,Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.
35,Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use.
37,The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus.
38,"A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy."
39,"An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235."
40,"The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation."
41,The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.
43,It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division.
44,"As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions."
45,"Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft."
46,"In the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen."
47,"By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced."
48,"In effect, it could be mechanically ""programmed"" to read instructions."
49,The tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters.
50,It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.
51,"The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration."
52,"In 1876, Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators."
53,"In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output."
54,The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work.
55,"Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers."
56,"Considered the ""father of the computer"", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century."
57,"After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible."
58,"The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom."
59,"For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell."
60,The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.
61,All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts.
62,"Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding."
63,Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow.
65,He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.
66,"However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers."
67,"The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872."
68,A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious.
69,"By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (slide rule) and aircraft (control systems)."
70,"This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target."
71,During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.
72,Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation.
73,"These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes."
74,"The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz."
75,Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard.
76,"It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers."
77,"Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design), using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time."
78,The Z3 was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete.
79,"The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange."
80,"Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes."
81,"This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory."
82,"During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications."
83,"The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes which were often run by women."
84,"To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus."
85,He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.
87,"It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete."
90,"Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete."
91,"Like the Colossus, a ""program"" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later."
92,"Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches."
93,"It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine."
94,"It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root."
95,High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes).
96,"The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors."
97,"Turing proposed a simple device that he called ""Universal Computing machine"" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine."
98,"He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable."
99,"The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory."
100,Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.
101,Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation.
102,"Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine."
103,Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.
104,With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed.
105,A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.
106,The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper.
107,"In 1945, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer."
108,"His 1945 report ""Proposed Electronic Calculator"" was the first specification for such a device."
109,"It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device."
110,"Although the computer was considered ""small and primitive"" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer."
111,"As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1."
112,"Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951."
113,"At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam."
114,The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951 and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.
115,"John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in 1948."
116,"From 1955 onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the ""second generation"" of computers."
117,"Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat."
118,"Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life."
119,Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.
120,"Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955."
121,"However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer."
122,"That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955, built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell."
123,It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.
124,"With its high scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits."
125,"In addition to data processing, it also enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements, leading to the development of MOS semiconductor memory, which replaced earlier magnetic-core memory in computers."
126,"The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution, and became the driving force behind the computer revolution."
127,"The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers, and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics."
129,"Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958."
130,"However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid integrated circuit (hybrid IC), rather than a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip."
131,Noyce's invention was the first true monolithic IC chip.
132,His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not.
133,"Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium."
134,"Noyce's monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process, developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959."
135,"After the first MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, Atalla first proposed the concept of the MOS integrated circuit in 1960, followed by Kahng in 1961, both noting that the MOS transistor's ease of fabrication made it useful for integrated circuits."
136,The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962.
137,"General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in 1964, developed by Robert Norman."
139,"While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term ""microprocessor"", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon-gate MOS IC technology, along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel."
140,They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory.
141,"If not integrated, The RAM is usually placed directly above (known as Package on package) or below (on the opposite side of the circuit board) the SoC, and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC, this all done to improve data transfer speeds, as the data signals don't have to travel long distances."
144,Later portables such as the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in.
145,"The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s."
146,The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early 2000s.
147,These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market.
148,"These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin."
149,"Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and ""mice"" input devices are all hardware."
150,"These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires."
151,Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch.
152,"Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a ""1"", and when off it represents a ""0"" (in positive logic representation)."
153,The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.
154,The input devices may be hand-operated or automated.
155,The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU.
156,Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.
157,Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
158,Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
159,Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device).
160,The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
161,Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
162,"If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation."
163,Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
164,Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program.
165,"Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as ""jumps"" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow)."
166,"The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen."
167,Early CPUs were composed of many separate components.
168,"Since the 1970s, CPUs have typically been constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor."
169,"Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) while others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision."
170,"However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform."
171,"Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation."
172,"An ALU may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (""is 64 greater than 65?"")."
174,These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic.
175,"Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously."
176,Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.
177,"Each cell has a numbered ""address"" and can store a single number."
179,The information stored in memory may represent practically anything.
180,"Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease."
181,"Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers."
182,"In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte)."
184,"To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight)."
185,"When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation."
186,"Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts."
187,A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically.
188,Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.
189,The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area.
190,There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU.
191,Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed.
192,"As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed."
194,ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions.
195,"In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely."
196,"In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset."
197,"In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM."
198,"Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software."
199,"Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable."
200,"Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part."
201,Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals.
202,"On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer."
203,"Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices."
205,"I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory."
206,A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.
207,Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O.
208,A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.
209,having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.
210,"One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead."
211,"By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later."
213,"then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time."
214,"Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant."
215,"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks."
216,"If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a ""time slice"" until the event it is waiting for has occurred."
217,This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.
218,"Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result."
219,Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general-purpose computers.
220,"They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware."
221,Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once.
222,"Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called ""embarrassingly parallel"" tasks."
223,"Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built."
224,"Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media."
225,It is often divided into system software and application software Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
226,"When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible computer, it is sometimes called ""firmware""."
227,"That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them."
228,Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.
229,"In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example."
230,A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation.
231,"Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors."
232,"In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc."
233,These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given.
234,"However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there."
236,"Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event."
237,"Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that ""remembers"" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction."
238,Program execution might be likened to reading a book.
239,"While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest."
240,"Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met."
241,This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.
242,"Comparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses."
243,"But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake."
244,"On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions."
246,It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.
247,"The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on."
248,"The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code."
249,"Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes."
250,This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data.
251,"The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture."
252,"In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on."
253,This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer.
254,"Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches."
255,"While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers, it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs."
256,"Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP."
257,These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language.
258,Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.
259,"Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise."
260,They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud.
261,"They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter."
262,Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.
263,"For instance, an ARM architecture CPU (such as may be found in a smartphone or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine language of an x86 CPU that might be in a PC."
264,"Historically a significant number of other cpu architectures were created and saw extensive use, notably including the MOS Technology 6502 and 6510 in addition to the Zilog Z80."
265,"Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error)."
266,"High level languages are usually ""compiled"" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler."
267,"High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program."
268,It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.
269,This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles.
270,"As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered."
271,Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
272,The task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge.
273,Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.
274,"They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects."
275,"But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to ""hang"", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash."
276,"Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution."
277,Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer.
278,"Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design."
279,"Admiral Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first used the term ""bugs"" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947."
280,"In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology."
282,The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.
283,"In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet."
284,The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer.
285,"Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer."
286,"Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous."
287,"In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally."
288,A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information.
289,"""Wireless"" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments."
290,"While popular usage of the word ""computer"" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern definition of a computer is literally: ""A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."""
291,"Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful."
292,"Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed."
293,However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.
294,Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.
295,"The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators."
298,"is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity."
299,Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
300,Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule based systems and pattern recognition systems.
301,Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop.
302,Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions.
303,"Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing."
304,"The need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations, clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature."
