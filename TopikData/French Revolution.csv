1,"An extended period of political turmoil followed, which included the Execution of Louis XVI and the Reign of Terror."
3,"In June, the Estates were converted into a National Assembly, which passed a series of radical measures, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church and extending the right to vote."
4,"The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression and social unrest."
5,"External powers like Austria, Britain and Prussia viewed the Revolution as a threat, leading to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792."
7,"In June, an uprising in Paris replaced the Girondins who dominated the National Assembly with the Committee of Public Safety, headed by Maximilien Robespierre."
9,"As well as external enemies, the Republic faced a series of internal Royalist and Jacobin revolts; in order to deal with these, the French Directory took power in November 1795."
10,"Despite military success, the war led to economic stagnation and internal divisions, and in November 1799 the Directory was replaced by the French Consulate."
12,"Over the next two centuries, its key principles like equality would inspire campaigns for the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage."
13,"Its values and institutions dominate French politics to this day, and many historians regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history."
14,"Rapid population growth and restrictions caused by the inability to adequately finance government debt resulted in economic depression, unemployment and high food prices."
15,"Combined with a regressive tax system and resistance to reform by the ruling elite, the result was a crisis Louis XVI proved unable to manage."
16,"From the late 17th century on, political and cultural debate became part of wider European society, rather than being confined to a small elite."
17,"This took different forms, such as the English 'coffeehouse culture', and extended to areas colonised by Europeans, particularly British North America."
18,"Contacts between diverse groups in Edinburgh, Geneva, Boston, Amsterdam, Paris, London or Vienna were much greater than often appreciated."
19,"Under Louis XIV, the Court at Versailles was the centre of culture, fashion and political power."
20,"Improvements in education and literacy over the course of the 18th century meant larger audiences for newspapers and journals, with Masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs providing areas where people could debate and discuss ideas."
21,"Inefficient agricultural methods meant domestic farmers could not support these numbers, while primitive transportation networks made it hard to maintain supplies even when there was sufficient."
23,"Food shortages were particularly damaging for the regime, since many blamed price increases on government failure to prevent profiteering."
25,"Although French borrowing costs were higher, the percentage of tax revenue devoted to interest payments was about the same in both countries."
26,"The underlying problem was these taxes were predominantly paid by the urban and rural poor, and attempts to share the burden more equally were blocked by the regional parlements which controlled financial policy."
27,"The resulting impasse in the face of widespread economic distress led to the calling of the Estates-General, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances."
28,"The court became the target of popular anger, especially Queen Marie-Antoinette, who was viewed as a spendthrift Austrian spy, and blamed for the dismissal of 'progressive' ministers like Jacques Necker."
29,"For their opponents, Enlightenment ideas on equality and democracy provided an intellectual framework for dealing with these issues, while the American Revolution was seen as confirmation of their practical application."
30,"Unlike Britain, where Parliament determined both expenditures and taxes, in France, the Crown controlled spending, but not revenue."
32,"Although willing to authorise one-time taxes, these bodies were reluctant to pass long-term measures, while collection was outsourced to private individuals."
33,"This significantly reduced the yield from those that were approved and as a result, France struggled to service its debt despite being larger and wealthier than Britain."
35,"The war was financed by state debt, creating a large rentier class who lived on the interest, primarily members of the French nobility or commercial classes."
36,"By 1785 the government was struggling to cover these payments; since default would ruin much of French society, this required an increase in taxes."
37,"When the parlements refused to comply, Calonne persuaded Louis to summon the Assembly of Notables, an advisory council dominated by the upper nobility."
38,"Led by de Brienne, former archbishop of Toulouse,  the Assembly argued that tax increases could only be authorised by the Estates-General."
42,"Although they contained ideas that would have seemed radical only months before,  most supported the monarchy, and assumed the Estates-General would agree to financial reforms, rather than fundamental constitutional change."
43,"The lifting of press censorship allowed widespread distribution of political writings, mostly written by liberal members of the aristocracy and upper middle-class."
44,"As was customary, each Estate assembled in separate rooms, whose furnishings and opening ceremonies deliberately emphasised the superiority of the First and Second Estates."
45,"They also insisted on enforcing the rule that only those who owned land could sit as deputies for the Second Estate, and thus excluded the immensely popular Comte de Mirabeau."
46,"As separate assemblies meant the Third Estate could always be outvoted by the other two, Sieyès sought to combine all three."
47,"His method was to require all deputies be approved by the Estates-General as a whole, instead of each Estate verifying its own members."
48,"Since this meant the legitimacy of deputies derived from the Estates-General, they would have to continue sitting as one body."
49,"After an extended stalemate, on 10 June the Third Estate proceeded to verify its own deputies, a process completed on 17 June; two days later, they were joined by over 100 members of the First Estate, and declared themselves the National Assembly."
53,The governor de Launay surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers.
54,"Taken to the Hôtel de Ville, he was executed, his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time."
55,"Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, two noblemen held for ""immoral behaviour"", and a murder suspect."
56,"Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the Ancien Régime, its destruction was viewed as a triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year."
57,"Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed Lafayette commander of the National Guard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune."
59,"However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people."
60,'The short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated.
61,"Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated."
63,"In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur."
64,The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad.
65,"Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns."
67,"From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications."
68,"However France had reached no consensus on the role of the Crown, and until this question was settled, it was impossible to create political institutions."
72,"Although Jefferson made major contributions to Lafayette's draft, he himself acknowledged an intellectual debt to Montesquieu, and the final version was significantly different."
74,"Mounier, supported by conservatives like Gérard de Lally-Tollendal, wanted a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king, who would have the right of veto."
76,"On this basis, a new committee was convened to agree on a constitution; the most controversial issue was citizenship, linked to the debate on the balance between individual rights and obligations."
78,"This came to a head in late September, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to take over as the royal bodyguard and in line with normal practice were welcomed with a ceremonial banquet."
80,"These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the Hôtel de Ville, some 7,000 marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their demands."
81,"Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped."
82,"They ransacked the palace, killing several guards."
83,"Although the situation remained tense, order was eventually restored, and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard."
84,"Announcing his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration, Louis committed to constitutional monarchy, and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'."
85,"One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire."
86,"The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic."
87,"The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops."
88,"In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned."
91,Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church.
92,"This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vendée, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution."
93,"Widespread refusal led to further legislation against the clergy, many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed."
94,"While certainly true, many provincial areas experienced conflict over the source of legitimate authority, where officers of the Ancien Régime had been swept away, but new structures were not yet in place."
95,"This was less obvious in Paris, since the formation of the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but growing disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly."
96,"Centrists led by Sieyès, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier, and independents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth."
97,"At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like Cazalès and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with extremists like Maximilien Robespierre at the other."
98,"He and Jean-Paul Marat gained increasing support for opposing the criteria for 'active citizens', which had disenfranchised much of the Parisian proletariat."
100,"Despite this show of unity, the Assembly was increasingly divided, while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power."
101,"However, moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage, labour unions and cheap bread, and over the winter of 1790 and 1791, they passed a series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism."
103,"Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became émigrés, further destabilising the institution."
105,"The attempted escape had a profound impact on public opinion; since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria, the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime, and began preparing for war, while fear of 'spies and traitors' became pervasive."
106,"Despite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic, Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution."
107,"A new decree stated retracting this oath, making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication."
109,"On 27 August, Emperor Leopold II and Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring their support for Louis, and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf."
110,"In reality, Leopold and Frederick had met to discuss the Partitions of Poland, and the Declaration was primarily made to satisfy Comte d'Artois and other émigrés."
111,"Although Robespierre himself was one of those excluded, his support in the clubs gave him a political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly, who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune."
113,"On 30 September, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day."
114,"These were exacerbated by Louis' refusal to accept limitations on his powers and attempts to mobilise external support to reverse it, combined with discontent over rising prices due to monetary inflation, which particularly impacted the urban working class."
115,"245 were affiliated with the Feuillants, led by Barnave, constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough."
116,"136 were Jacobin leftists, led by Brissot and often referred to as Brissotins, who regarded Louis with hostility and wanted a republic."
117,"The first concerned émigrés; between October and November, the Assembly approved measures confiscating their property and threatening them with the death penalty."
118,"The second was non-juring priests; opposition to the Civil Constitution had resulted in a state of near civil war in southern France, which Bernave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions."
119,"On 29 November, the Assembly passed a decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply, or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation', which even Robespierre viewed as too far, too soon."
121,"Accompanying this was a campaign for war against Austria and Prussia, also led by Brissot, whose aims have been interpreted as a mixture of cynical calculation and revolutionary idealism."
122,"It exploited popular anti-Austrianism, especially as represented by Marie Antoinette, but also a genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty."
123,"Ironically, Marie Antoinette headed a faction within the court that also favoured war, seeing it as a way to win control of the military, and restore royal authority."
125,"On the morning of 10 August, a combined force of Parisian National Guard and provincial fédérés attacked the Tuileries Palace, killing many of the Swiss Guard protecting it."
126,"Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am, the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king', effectively suspending the monarchy."
127,"The former Brissotins now split into moderate Girondins led by Brissot, and radical Montagnards, headed by Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat."
128,"While loyalties constantly shifted, around 160 of the 749 deputies were Girondists, 200 Montagnards and 389 members of La Plaine."
130,"Responsibility is disputed, but even moderates expressed sympathy for the action, which soon spread to the provinces; the killings reflected widespread concern over social disorder On 20 September, the French army won a stunning victory over the Prussians at Valmy."
132,"The next few months were taken up with the trial of Citoyen Louis Capet, formerly Louis XVI."
133,"While the Convention was evenly divided on the question of his guilt, members were increasingly influenced by radicals centred in the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune."
135,"Horrified conservatives across Europe called for the destruction of revolutionary France; in February the Convention anticipated this by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic; these countries were later joined by Spain, Portugal, Naples and the Tuscany in the War of the First Coalition."
136,Many left for the provinces.
138,"Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vendée rose in revolt."
139,"On 18th, Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians."
140,"Uprisings followed in Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulon, Marseilles and Caen."
141,"The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the Revolutionary Tribunal for allegedly directing the September massacres; he was quickly acquitted, further isolating the Girondins from the sans-culottes."
143,Growing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins.
148,"The urgent task of suppressing internal dissent was helped by divisions among their opponents; while areas like the Vendée and Brittany wanted to restore the monarchy, most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris."
150,"At the end of July, the Convention set price controls over a wide range of goods, with the death penalty for hoarders, and on 9 September 'revolutionary groups' were established to enforce them."
152,"However, France's biggest challenge was servicing the huge public debt inherited from the former regime, which continued to expand due to the war."
153,"Initially financed by sales of confiscated property, this was hugely inefficient; since few would buy assets that might be repossessed, fiscal stability could only be achieved by continuing the war until French counter-revolutionaries had been defeated."
154,"In mid-October, Marie Antoinette was found guilty of a long list of crimes and guillotined; two weeks later, the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed, along with Philippe Égalité."
158,The extent of the brutal repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th century.
161,"Although those numbers have been challenged, François Furet concluded it ""not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale, but a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region's identity."""
162,"At the height of the Terror, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thought could place one under suspicion, and even its supporters were not immune."
163,"Under the pressure of events, splits appeared within the Montagnard faction, with violent disagreements between radical Hébertists and moderates led by Danton."
164,"Robespierre saw their dispute as de-stabilising the regime, and as a deist he objected to the anti-religious policies advocated by the atheist Hébert."
166,"Those arrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judgement; from March to July, executions in Paris increased from five to twenty-six a day."
167,"Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June, a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre, who was also accused of circulating claims he was a second Messiah."
168,"Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the sans-culottes, but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger."
169,"Many feared their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal; during a meeting on 29 June, three members of the Committee of Public Safety called him a dictator in his face."
170,"Robespierre responded by not attending sessions, allowing his opponents to build a coalition against him."
172,"When he refused to give names, the session broke up in confusion."
173,"That evening he made the same speech at the Jacobins club, where it was greeted with huge applause and demands for execution of the 'traitors'."
175,"His voice failed when he tried to speak, a deputy crying ""The blood of Danton chokes him!"
177,"That evening, units loyal to the Convention stormed the building, and Robespierre was arrested after a failed suicide attempt."
179,François Furet argues the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition.
180,"A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events, exacerbated by war."
181,"Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders, some of the leading ""terrorists"" retained their positions."
182,"They included Paul Barras, later chief executive of the French Directory, and Joseph Fouché, director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police under the Directory, the Consulate and Empire."
183,"Others were exiled or prosecuted, a process that took several months."
188,"Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy d'Anglas, it established a bicameral legislature, intended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems."
190,"Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification, it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies."
193,"Although these criticisms were certainly valid, it also faced internal unrest, a stagnating economy and an expensive war, while hampered by the impracticality of the constitution."
195,"As a result, the Directory was characterised by ""chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression."
196,"""Retention of the Conventionnels ensured the Thermidorians held a majority in the legislature and three of the five Directors, but they faced an increasing challenge from the right."
200,"Despite limited support from sections of the military, it was easily crushed, with Babeuf and other leaders executed."
201,"The same percentage were broadly centrist or unaffiliated, along with two Directors, Étienne-François Letourneur and Lazare Carnot."
204,"With Royalists apparently on the verge of power, the Republicans staged a coup on 4 September."
206,"The election results were cancelled, sixty-three leading royalists deported to French Guiana and new laws passed against émigrés, Royalists and ultra-Jacobins."
208,"Without a majority in the legislature, the Directors relied on the army to enforcing decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories."
209,"The architect of its end was Sieyès, who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered ""I survived""."
210,"Nominated to the Directory, his first action was removing Barras, using a coalition that included Talleyrand and former Jacobin Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother and president of the Council of 500."
213,"Austria was at war with the Ottomans, as were the Russians, while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland."
215,"Since it expected a short war, the recruits were to serve for twelve months."
216,"It was a different kind of war, fought by nations rather than kings, intended to destroy their opponents' ability to resist, but also to implement deep-ranging social change."
217,"After defeating a second Austrian army at Jemappes on 6 November, they occupied the Netherlands, areas of the Rhineland, Nice and Savoy."
221,"Despite high rates of desertion, this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats; for comparison, the combined Prussian-Austrian army was less than 90,000."
224,"Second, armies were primarily loyal to their generals, for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves."
225,"As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris, they were happy to allow them to continue fighting, a key factor behind sanctioning Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt."
228,"""The Revolution in Saint Domingue was the most notable example of slave uprisings in French colonies."
233,Among the most significant were Marat's L'Ami du peuple and Elysée Loustallot's Revolutions de Paris.
235,"There was a widespread assumption writing was a vocation not a business, and the role of the press advancement of civic republicanism."
237,"To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics."
238,These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.
241,It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital.
242,"The song is the first example of the ""European march"" anthemic style, while the evocative melody and lyrics led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music."
243,De Lisle was instructed to 'produce a hymn which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'
244,"Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory."
245,Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die.
246,"Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women (tricoteuses) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd."
247,Parents often brought their children.
248,"By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically."
249,"Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored."
250,They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien Régime.
253,"Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms."
254,"It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty."
256,"They expressed these demands using pamphlets and clubs such as the Cercle Social, whose largely male members viewed themselves as contemporary feminists."
257,"However, in October 1793, the Assembly banned all women's clubs and the movement was crushed; this was driven by the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, antagonism towards feminine ""interference"" in state affairs due to Marie Antoinette, and traditional male supremacy."
258,"Activists included Girondists like Olympe de Gouges, author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and Charlotte Corday, the killer of Marat."
263,They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread – the major food of the poor people – from becoming too expensive.
265,Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.
266,"Meanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers."
267,"At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal."
268,They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men.
269,Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793.
270,"Her publications emphasised that women and men are different, but this shouldn't prevent equality under the law."
271,Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist.
272,Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation.
273,"She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world."
274,"Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join."
279,"This sparked a counter-revolutionary movement led by women; while supporting other political and social changes, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being."
281,"In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic."
282,These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.
283,"All church lands were nationalised, along with those owned by Royalist exiles, which were used to back paper currency known as assignats, and the feudal guild system eliminated."
284,"It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee."
286,"The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and school systems were massively disruptedBetween 1790 to 1796, industrial and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared, forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities assignats."
287,"When this resulted in escalating inflation, the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders, creating a Black market."
290,"Its impact on French nationalism was profound, while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe."
291,"Its influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it was either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it."
292,The system established by Louis XIV centralised political power at Versailles and was controlled by the monarch.
293,"His power derived from immense personal wealth, control over the army and appointment of clergy, provincial governors, lawyers and judges."
294,"In less than a year, the king was reduced to a figurehead, the nobility deprived of titles and estates and the church of its monasteries and property."
295,"Clergy, judges and magistrates were controlled by the state, and the army sidelined, with military power placed held by the revolutionary National Guard."
297,"""The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century."
298,"The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity."""
299,"In 1788, it held a dominant position within society, to the extent being French was synonymous with Catholicism."
300,"By 1799, much of its property and institutions had been confiscated and its senior leaders dead or in exile."
301,"Its cultural influence was also under attack, with efforts made to remove  such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies."
302,Ultimately these attempts not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious; opposition to these changes was a key factor behind the revolt in the Vendée.
303,"Over the centuries, charitable foundations had been set up to fund hospitals, poor relief, and schools; when these were confiscated and sold off, the funding was not replaced, causing massive disruption to these support systems."
305,Demand remained strong and after 1800 nuns resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates.
306,"An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether with the Cult of Reason, and with civic festivals replacing religious ones, leading to attacks by locals on state officials."
307,"The Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Church's traditional roles but not its power, lands or monasteries; the clergy became public officials controlled by Paris, not Rome, while Protestants and Jews gained equal rights."
308,"However, debate continues into the present over the role of religion in the public sphere and related issues such as church-controlled schools."
309,"Recent arguments over the use of Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as wearing headscarves, have been explicitly linked to the conflict over Catholic rituals and symbols during the Revolution."
310,"With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms."
311,"Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues, much to the relief of the peasants."
312,"Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch."
313,"Because all the children had a share in the family's property, there was a declining birth rate."
314,"Cobban says the Revolution bequeathed to the nation ""a ruling class of landowners."
315,"""In the cities, entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished, as restrictive monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes and guilds gave way."
316,"However, the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade, hurting the cities and their supply chains."
317,"Overall, the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system, and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner."
318,"Another 2017 paper found that the redistribution of land had a positive impact on agricultural productivity, but that these gains gradually declined over the course of the 19th century."
319,"Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one."
323,"However, there were no efforts by the Bourbons, Vichy or anyone else to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789."
324,France permanently became a society of equals under the law.
325,"In the Soviet Union, ""Gracchus"" Babeuf was regarded as a hero."
327,"They suggest that ""areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth, especially after 1850."
328,There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion.
331,"Yet in Britain the majority, especially among the aristocracy, strongly opposed the French Revolution."
332,"Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons."
333,"Philosophically and politically, Britain was in debate over the rights and wrongs of revolution, in the abstract and in practicalities."
334,"The Revolution Controversy was a ""pamphlet war"" set off by the publication of A Discourse on the Love of Our Country, a speech given by Richard Price to the Revolution Society on 4 November 1789, supporting the French Revolution (as he had the American Revolution), and saying that patriotism actually centers around loving the people and principles of a nation, not its ruling class."
337,"It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster."
