1,"From the late 15th century to the early 19th century, Spain controlled a huge overseas territory in the New World, the Southeast Asian archipelago of the Philippines, what they called ""The Indies"" (Spanish: Las Indias) and territories in Europe (centering on the so-called Spanish Road), Africa and Oceania."
4,"The crown's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage, giving it power in the religious sphere."
5,"An important element in the formation of Spain's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, known as the Catholic Monarchs, which initiated political, religious and social cohesion but not political unification."
6,"Iberian kingdoms retained their political identities, with particular administration and juridical configurations."
7,"Although the power of the Spanish sovereign as monarch varied from one territory to another, the monarch acted as such in a unitary manner over all the ruler's territories through a system of councils: the unity did not mean uniformity."
8,"In 1580, when Philip II of Spain succeeded to the throne of Portugal (as Philip I), he established the Council of Portugal, which oversaw Portugal and its empire and ""preserv[ed] its own laws, institutions, and monetary system, and united only in sharing a common sovereign."""
9,"In the early 16th century, it conquered and incorporated the Aztec and Inca empires, retaining indigenous elites loyal to the Spanish crown and converts to Christianity as intermediaries between their communities and royal government."
10,"After a short period of delegation of authority by the crown in the Americas, the crown asserted control over those territories and established the Council of the Indies to oversee rule there."
11,"The crown then established viceroyalties in the two main areas of settlement, Mexico and Peru, both regions of dense indigenous populations and mineral wealth."
12,The Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation—the first circumnavigation of the Earth—laid the foundation for the Pacific oceanic empire of Spain and began the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.
13,The structure of governance of its overseas empire was significantly reformed in the late 18th century by the Bourbon monarchs.
14,"Although the crown attempted to keep its empire a closed economic system under Habsburg rule, Spain was unable to supply the Indies with sufficient consumer goods to meet demand, so that foreign merchants from Genoa, France, England, Germany, and the Netherlands dominated the trade, with silver from the mines of Peru and Mexico flowing to other parts of Europe."
15,The merchant guild of Seville (later Cadiz) served as middlemen in the trade.
16,"The crown's trade monopoly was broken early in the 17th century, with the crown colluding with the merchant guild for fiscal reasons in circumventing the supposedly closed system."
17,"Spain was largely able to defend its territories in the Americas, with the Dutch, the English, and the French only taking small Caribbean islands and outposts, using them to engage in contraband trade with the Spanish populace in the Indies."
18,"The Bourbon monarchy attempted to expand trade within the empire, by allowing commerce between all ports in the empire, and took other measures to revive economic activity to the benefit of Spain."
19,"In the process, they gained a revenue and lost an empire."
20,"Spain experienced its greatest territorial losses during the early 19th century, when its colonies in the Americas began fighting for independence."
21,"By the year 1900 Spain had also lost its colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific, and it was left with only its African possessions."
22,"In Spanish America among the legacies of its relationship with Iberia, Spanish is the dominant language, Catholicism the main religion, and political traditions of representative government can be traced to the Spanish Constitution of 1812."
23,"In conjunction with the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire's establishment in the 15th century ushered in the modern global era and the rise of European dominance in global affairs."
24,The union of Castile and Aragon united the economic and military power of Iberia under one dynasty.
25,"Their dynastic alliance was important for a number of reasons, ruling jointly over a large aggregation of territories although not in a unitary fashion."
26,"They successfully pursued expansion in Iberia in the Christian conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, completed in 1492, for which Valencia-born Pope Alexander VI gave them the title of the Catholic Monarchs."
27,"The Kingdom of Portugal had an advantage over the Crown of Castile, having earlier retaken territory from the Muslims."
28,"Following Portugal's earlier completion of the reconquest and its establishment of settled boundaries, it began to seek overseas expansion, first to the port of Ceuta (1415) and then by colonizing the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1418) and the Azores (1427–1452); it also began voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century."
29,Its rival Castile laid claim to the Canary Islands (1402) and retook territory from the Moors in 1462.
30,"The Christian rivals, Castile and Portugal, came to formal agreements over the division of new territories in the Treaty of Alcaçovas (1479), as well as securing the crown of Castile for Isabella, whose accession was challenged militarily by Portugal."
31,"Following the voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and first major settlement in the New World in 1493, Portugal and Castile divided the world by the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), which gave Portugal Africa and Asia and the Western Hemisphere to Spain."
32,"The voyage of Christopher Columbus, a Genoese mariner married to a Portuguese woman in Lisbon, obtained the support of Isabella of Castile, sailing west in 1492, seeking a route to the Indies."
33,"Columbus unexpectedly encountered the western hemisphere, populated by peoples he named ""Indians."""
34,"Subsequent voyages and full-scale settlements of Spaniards followed, with gold beginning to flow into Castile's coffers."
35,Managing the expanding empire became an administrative issue.
36,"The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella began the professionalization of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (letrados) who were university graduates (licenciados), of Salamanca, Valladolid, Complutense and Alcalá."
37,"These lawyer-bureaucrats staffed the various councils of state, eventually including the Council of the Indies and Casa de Contratación, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the empire in the New World, as well as royal government in The Indies."
38,"To do so, the monarchy implemented a system of encomienda."
39,Encomienda was a method of land control and distribution based upon vassalic ties.
40,"Land would be granted to a noble family, who were then responsible for farming and defending it."
41,"This eventually led to a large land based aristocracy, a separate ruling class that the crown later tried to eliminate in its overseas colonies."
42,"By implementing this method of political organization, the crown was able to implement new forms of private property without completely replacing already existing systems, such as the communal use of resources."
43,"After the military and political conquest, there was an emphasis on religious conquest as well, leading to the creation of the Spanish Inquisition."
44,"Although the Inquisition was technically a part of the Catholic church, Ferdinand and Isabella formed a separate Spanish Inquisition, which led to mass expulsion of Muslims and Jews from the peninsula."
45,"This religious court system was later adopted and transported to the Americas, though they took a less effective role there due to limited jurisdiction and large territories."
46,"It had conquered Melilla in 1497, and further expansionism policy in North Africa was developed during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by the Cardinal Cisneros."
47,"Several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile: Mazalquivir (1505), Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1508), Oran (1509), Algiers (1510), Bougie and Tripoli (1510)."
48,"On the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña (1476) with support from the Canary Islands, and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the treaty of Cintra (1509)."
49,"The Spanish princesses married the heirs of Portugal, England and the House of Habsburg."
50,"Following the same strategy, the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Aragonese house of Naples against Charles VIII of France in the Italian Wars beginning in 1494."
51,Ferdinand's general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba took over Naples after defeating the French at the Battle of Cerignola and the Battle of Garigliano in 1503.
52,"In these battles, which established the supremacy of the Spanish Tercios in European battlefields, the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century."
53,"After the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, and her exclusion of Ferdinand from a further role in Castile, Ferdinand married Germaine de Foix in 1505, cementing an alliance with France."
54,"Had that couple had a surviving heir, likely the Crown of Aragon would have been split from Castile, which was inherited by Charles, Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson."
55,Ferdinand joined the League of Cambrai against Venice in 1508.
56,"In 1511, he became part of the Holy League against France, seeing a chance at taking both Milan—to which he held a dynastic claim—and Navarre."
57,"In 1516, France agreed to a truce that left Milan in its control and recognized Spanish control of Upper Navarre, which had effectively been a Spanish protectorate following a series of treaties in 1488, 1491, 1493, and 1495."
58,"The conquest of the Canary Islands, inhabited by Guanche people, began in 1402 during the reign of Henry III of Castile, by Norman nobleman Jean de Béthencourt under a feudal agreement with the crown."
59,"The conquest was completed with the campaigns of the armies of the Crown of Castile between 1478 and 1496, when the islands of Gran Canaria (1478–1483), La Palma (1492–1493), and Tenerife (1494–1496) were subjugated."
60,"Chronicler Pulgar wrote that the fame of the treasures of Guinea ""spread around the ports of Andalusia in such way that everybody tried to go there""."
61,"Worthless trinkets, Moorish textiles, and above all, shells from the Canary and Cape Verde islands were exchanged for gold, slaves, ivory and Guinea pepper."
62,"The War of the Castilian Succession (1475–79) provided the Catholic Monarchs with the opportunity not only to attack the main source of the Portuguese power, but also to take possession of this lucrative commerce."
63,The Crown officially organized this trade with Guinea: every caravel had to secure a government license and to pay a tax on one-fifth of their profits (a receiver of the customs of Guinea was established in Seville in 1475—the ancestor of the future and famous Casa de Contratación).
64,"Castilian fleets fought in the Atlantic Ocean, temporarily occupying the Cape Verde islands (1476), conquering the city of Ceuta in the Tingitan Peninsula in 1476 (but retaken by the Portuguese), and even attacked the Azores islands, being defeated at Praia."
65,"As a result of this naval victory, at the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479 Castile, while retaining her rights in the Canaries, recognized the Portuguese monopoly of fishing and navigation along the whole west African coast and Portugal's rights over the Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde islands [plus the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez ]."""
66,"The treaty delimited the spheres of influence of the two countries, establishing the principle of the Mare clausum."
67,"Thus, the limitations imposed by the Alcáçovas treaty were overcome and a new and more balanced division of the world would be reached in the Treaty of Tordesillas between both emerging maritime powers."
68,"The Catholic Monarchs then negotiated with Christopher Columbus, a Genoese sailor attempting to reach Cipangu (Japan) by sailing west."
69,Castile was already engaged in a race of exploration with Portugal to reach the Far East by sea when Columbus made his bold proposal to Isabella.
70,"In the Capitulations of Santa Fe, dated on 17 April 1492, Christopher Columbus obtained from the Catholic Monarchs his appointment as viceroy and governor in the lands already discovered and that he might discover thenceforth; thereby, it was the first document to establish an administrative organization in the Indies."
71,Columbus' discoveries inaugurated the Spanish colonization of the Americas.
72,"Spain's claim to these lands was solidified by the Inter caetera papal bull dated 4 May 1493, and Dudum siquidem on 26 September 1493, which vested the sovereignty of the territories discovered and to be discovered."
73,"Since the Portuguese wanted to keep the line of demarcation of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the globe was split into two hemispheres dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims."
74,"These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in all of the New World from north to south (later with the exception of Brazil, which Portuguese commander Pedro Alvares Cabral encountered in 1500), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia."
75,The treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull Ea quae pro bono pacis on 24 January 1506.
76,Other European powers did not see the treaty between Castile and Portugal as binding on themselves.
77,"Francis I of France observed ""The sun shines for me as for others and I should very much like to see the clause in Adam's will that excludes me from a share of the world."""
78,"Since the defense of Catholicism and propagation of the faith was the papacy's primary responsibility, there were a number of papal bulls promulgated that affected the powers of the crowns of Spain and Portugal in the religious sphere."
79,"Converting the inhabitants of in the newly discovered lands was entrusted by the papacy to the rulers of Portugal and Spain, through a series of papal actions."
80,"The Patronato real, or power of royal patronage for ecclesiastical positions had precedents in Iberia during the reconquest."
81,"In 1493 Pope Alexander, from the Iberian Kingdom of Valencia, issued a series of bulls."
82,The papal bull of Inter caetera vested the government and jurisdiction of newly found lands in the kings of Castile and León and their successors.
83,The territories were incorporated by the Catholic Monarchs as jointly held assets.
84,"In the Treaty of Villafáfila of 1506, Ferdinand renounced not only the government of Castile in favor of his son-in-law Philip I of Castile but also the lordship of the Indies, withholding a half of the income of the kingdoms of the Indies."
86,"The political condition of the Indies were to transform from ""Lordship"" of the Catholic Monarchs to ""Kingdoms"" for the heirs of Castile."
87,"In general, Indians were exempt from the tithe."
88,"Although the crown received these revenues, they were to be used for the direct support of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and pious establishments, so that the crown itself did not benefit financially from this income."
89,"The experiment was deemed a failure, with the natives considered too new in the faith to be ordained."
90,"Pope Paul III did issue a bull, Sublimis Deus (1537), declaring that natives were capable of becoming Christians, but Mexican (1555) and Peruvian (1567–68) provincial councils banned natives from ordination."
91,"The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted on the assumption that Columbus's grandiose assessment of what he found was true, so Spain negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line."
92,The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges.
93,"With that lesson learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas."
94,"The pattern in the Caribbean that played out over the larger Spanish Indies was exploration of an unknown area and claim of sovereignty for the crown; conquest of indigenous peoples or assumption of control without direct violence; settlement by Spaniards who were awarded the labour of indigenous people via the encomienda; and the existing settlements becoming the launch point for further exploration, conquest, and settlement, followed by the establishment institutions with officials appointed by the crown."
95,"As a Genoese with the connections to Portugal, Columbus considered settlement to be on the pattern of trading forts and factories, with salaried employees to trade with locals and to identify exploitable resources."
96,"However, Spanish settlement in the New World was based on a pattern of a large, permanent settlements with the entire complex of institutions and material life to replicate Castilian life in a different venue."
97,Columbus's second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that.
98,"On Hispaniola, the city of Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus's brother Bartholomew Columbus and became a stone-built, permanent city."
99,"As the Caribbean became a draw for Spanish settlement and as Columbus and his extended Genoese family failed to be recognized as officials worthy of the titles they held, there was unrest among Spanish settlers."
100,"The crown began to curtail the expansive powers that they had granted Columbus, first by appointment of royal governors and then a high court or Audiencia in 1511."
101,"Columbus encountered the mainland in 1498, and the Catholic Monarchs learned of his discovery in May 1499."
102,"Taking advantage of a revolt against Columbus in Hispaniola, they appointed Francisco de Bobadilla as governor of the Indies with civil and criminal jurisdiction over the lands discovered by Columbus."
103,"Bobadilla, however, was soon replaced by Frey Nicolás de Ovando in September 1501."
104,"Henceforth, the Crown would authorize to individuals voyages to discover territories in the Indies only with previous royal license, and after 1503 the monopoly of the Crown was assured by the establishment of the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) at Seville."
105,"The successors of Columbus, however, litigated against the Crown until 1536 for the fulfillment of the Capitulations of Santa Fe in the pleitos colombinos."
106,"In metropolitan Spain, the direction of the Americas was taken over by the Bishop Fonseca between 1493 and 1516, and again between 1518 and 1524, after a brief period of rule by Jean le Sauvage."
107,"That same year, the crown established a permanent high court, or audiencia, in the most important city at the time, Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic)."
108,Now oversight of the Indies was based both in Castile and with officials of the new royal court in the colony.
109,Those from the less prosperous Hispaniola were eager to search for new success in a new settlement.
110,From there Juan Ponce de León conquered Puerto Rico (1508) and Diego Velázquez took Cuba.
113,"The crown separated the territories of the mainland, designated as Castilla de Oro, from the viceroy of Hispaniola, establishing Pedrarias Dávila as General Lieutenant in 1513 with functions similar to those of a viceroy, while Balboa remained but was subordinated as governor of Panama and Coiba on the Pacific Coast; after his death, they returned to Castilla de Oro."
114,"The territory of Castilla de Oro did not include Veragua (which was comprised approximately between the Chagres River and cape Gracias a Dios), as it was subject to a lawsuit between the Crown and Diego Columbus, or the region farther north, towards the Yucatán peninsula, explored by Yáñez Pinzón and Solís in 1508–1509, due to its remoteness."
115,"The conflicts of the viceroy Columbus with the royal officers and with the Audiencia, created in Santo Domingo in 1511, caused his return to the Peninsula in 1515."
117,"It did stimulate some trade and industry, but the trading opportunities encountered were limited."
118,"Therefore, Spain started to invest in America with the creation of cities, because Spain was in America due to religious reasons."
119,"Matters began to change in the 1520s with the large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's Guanajuato region, but it was the opening of the silver mines in Mexico's Zacatecas and Potosí in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia) in 1546 that became legendary."
120,These imports contributed to inflation in Spain and Europe from the last decades of the 16th century.
121,The vast imports of silver also made local manufactures uncompetitive and ultimately made Spain overly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials and manufactured goods.
122,"""I learnt a proverb here"", said a French traveler in 1603: ""Everything is dear in Spain except silver""."
123,The problems caused by inflation were discussed by scholars at the School of Salamanca and the arbitristas.
124,The natural resource abundance provoked a decline in entrepreneurship as profits from resource extraction are less risky.
125,The wealthy preferred to invest their fortunes in public debt (juros).
126,"The Habsburg dynasty spent the Castilian and American riches in wars across Europe on behalf of Habsburg interests, and declared moratoriums (bankruptcies) on their debt payments several times."
127,"These burdens led to a number of revolts across the Spanish Habsburg's domains, including their Spanish kingdoms, but the rebellions were put down."
128,"He was the first Habsburg monarch of Spain and co-ruler of Spain with his mother, Queen Juana."
129,Charles had been raised in Mechelen and his interests remained those of Christian Europe.
130,"While not directly an inheritance, Charles was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire after the death of his grandfather Emperor Maximilian."
132,"Despite holding the imperial throne, Charles' real authority was limited by the German princes."
133,"They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands."
136,"Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the Duke of Alba, personally suppressed the Revolt of Ghent (1539–1540)."
137,"Charles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favor of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558."
138,"Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of emperor."
139,The overseas lands claimed by Spain in the New World proved to be a source of wealth and the crown was able to assert greater control over its overseas possessions in the political and religious spheres than was possible on Iberian peninsula or in Europe.
140,"The conquests of the Aztec Empire and the Inca Empire brought vast indigenous civilizations into the Spanish Empire and the mineral wealth, particularly silver, were identified and exploited, becoming the economic lifeblood of the crown."
141,"Under Charles, Spain and its overseas empire in the Americas became deeply entwined, with the crown enforcing Catholic exclusivity; exercising crown primacy in political rule, unencumbered by claims of an existing aristocracy; and defending its claims against other European powers."
146,Milan was administered by Castilian governors.
147,"Pope Clement VII joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, resulting in the War of the League of Cognac (1526–30)."
148,"Charles's sack of Rome (1527) and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from annulling the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt Catherine of Aragon, so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the English Reformation."
149,"In other respects, the war was inconclusive."
150,"A third war erupted in 1535, when, following the death of the last Sforza Duke of Milan, Charles installed his own son, Philip, in the duchy, despite Francis's claims on it."
151,"Francis failed to conquer Milan, but succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally the Duke of Savoy, including his capital, Turin."
152,The crowns of Castile and Aragon depended on Genoese bankers for its finances and the Genoese fleet aided the Spanish in fighting the Ottomans in the Mediterranean.
153,"They had defeated the eastern Christian Byzantine empire and seized its capital, creating it as the Ottoman capital and the Ottomans controlled a rich area of the eastern Mediterranean, with links to Asia, Egypt, and India and in by the mid-sixteenth century, they ruled a third of Europe."
154,"The Ottomans had created an impressive land and maritime empire, with port cities and short and long range trade connections."
155,"Charles's great rival was Suleiman the Magnificent, whose rule almost exactly coincided with Charles's."
156,"A contemporary Spanish writer, Francisco López de Gómara, compared Charles unfavorably with Suleiman in the 1540s, saying that although both were wealthy and pursued war, ""the Turks succeeded better at fulfilling their projects than did the Spanish; they devoted themselves more fully to the order and discipline of war, they were better advised, they used their money more effectively."
158,"At the same time, Ottoman corsairs regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power."
160,"Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against Charles for standing in the way of his divorce, joined him in his invasion of France."
161,"Although the Spanish were defeated at the Battle of Ceresole in Savoy, the French army was unable to seriously threaten Spanish-controlled Milan, while suffering defeat in the north at the hands of Henry, thereby being forced to accept unfavorable terms."
162,"The Austrians, led by Charles's younger brother Ferdinand, continued to fight the Ottomans in the east."
163,"The presence of Spain in North Africa declined during Charles's reign, though Tunis and its port, La Goleta, were taken in 1535."
164,"One after another, most of the Spanish possessions were lost: Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1522), Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña (1524), Algiers (1529), Tripoli (1551), and Bougie (1555)."
165,"Francis's defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity."
166,"He first tried the path of negotiation at the Council of Trent in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the Saxon elector Maurice."
167,"In response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch–Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority."
168,The emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic Battle of Mühlberg in 1547.
170,"Charles's involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic, Habsburg cause in the Holy Roman Empire; the precedent would lead, seven decades later, to involvement in the war that would decisively end Spain as Europe's leading power."
171,"The situation changed dramatically with the expedition of Hernán Cortés, who, with alliances with city-states hostile to the Aztecs and thousands of indigenous Mexican warriors, conquered the Aztec Empire (1519–1521)."
172,"Following the pattern established in Spain during the Reconquista and in the Caribbean, the first European settlements in the Americas, conquerors divided up the indigenous population in private holdings encomiendas and exploited their labor."
173,Central Mexico and later the Inca Empire of Peru gave Spain vast new indigenous populations to convert to Christianity and rule as vassals of the crown.
174,Charles established the Council of the Indies in 1524 to oversee all of Castile's overseas possessions.
175,"Charles appointed a viceroy in Mexico in 1535, capping the royal governance of the high court, Real Audiencia, and treasury officials with the highest royal official."
176,"Following the conquest of Peru, in 1542 Charles likewise appointed a viceroy."
177,Both officials were under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies.
178,Charles promulgated the New Laws of 1542 to limit the power of the conqueror group to form a hereditary aristocracy that might challenge the power of the crown.
179,"Philip was born in Valladolid on 21 May 1527, and was the only legitimate son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, by his wife Isabella of Portugal."
180,"He did not become Holy Roman Emperor, but divided Habsburg possessions with his uncle Ferdinand."
181,"Philip treated Castile as the foundation of his empire, but the population of Castile was never great enough to provide the soldiers needed to defend the Empire or settlers to populate it."
182,"His father married him to Queen Mary I of England in 1554 to form an alliance with the English, and both Philip and Mary were Catholics, making them unpopular with the Church of England and the Protestant majority of England."
183,"He seized the throne of Portugal in 1580, creating the Iberian Union and bringing the entire Iberian peninsula under his personal rule."
184,"According to one of his biographers, it was entirely due to Philip that the Indies were brought under crown control, remaining Spanish until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century and Catholic to the present era."
185,"His greatest failure was his inability to suppress the Dutch Revolt, which was aided by English and French rivals."
186,"His militant Catholicism also played a major role in his actions, as did his inability to understand imperial finances."
187,"He inherited his father's debts and incurred his own pursuing religious wars, resulting in recurring state bankruptcies and dependence on Genoese and German bankers."
188,"Although there was an enormous expansion of silver production in Peru and Mexico, it did not remain in the Indies or even in Spain itself, but rather much of it went to European merchant houses."
189,"Under Philip's rule, learned men, known as arbitristas began writing analyses of this paradox of Spain's impoverishment."
190,"The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by his less capable son Selim the Sot emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the sultan himself."
192,The battle ended the threat of Ottoman naval hegemony in the Mediterranean.
193,The victory was aided by the participation of various military leaders and contingents from parts of Italy under Philip's rule.
195,"They reconquered Tunis in 1574, and they helped to restore an ally, Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi, to the throne of Morocco, in 1576."
196,"The death of the Persian shah, Tahmasp I, was an opportunity for the Ottoman sultan to intervene in that country, so he agreed to a truce in the Mediterranean with Philip II in 1580."
197,"Larache and La Mamora, on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, and the island of Alhucemas, in the Mediterranean, were taken, but during the second half of the 17th century, Larache and La Mamora were also lost."
200,"The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy."
201,"France was stricken for the next thirty years by chronic civil war and unrest and, during this period, removed it from effectively competing with Spain and the Habsburg family in European power games."
202,"Freed from effective French opposition, Spain attained the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559–1643."
205,These battles are generally considered to signal the start of the Eighty Years' War that ended with the independence of the United Provinces in 1648.
206,"The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of Antwerp, were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces."
207,"According to Luc-Normand Tellier, ""It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Americas."
208,The war dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the Rhineland with the Cologne War.
211,"Groningen, Breda, Campen, Dunkirk, Antwerp, and Brussels, among others, were put to siege."
212,Farnese eventually secured the Southern provinces for Spain.
215,The Queen of England began to aid the Northern provinces and sent troops there in 1585.
216,English forces under the Earl of Leicester and then Lord Willoughby faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under Farnese in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganize their defenses.
219,The English fleet was at Plymouth and followed the Armada up the Channel.
220,"The first encounter was off Plymouth, 21 July, the second off Portland Bill, 23 July, the third off the Isle of Wight, 24 July."
221,"The fighting culminated in the Battle of Gravelines, off the coast of Flanders."
222,"After eight hours of intense fighting, the English ran low on ammunition and pulled back."
223,"Since the Spanish were trained to board enemy ships and fight hand-to-hand, their cannons were not designed to be fired repeatedly."
224,"While the Spanish fleet had sailed with 2,431 cannons, many were intended for a ground assault after landing and were useless for naval battles."
225,"Through a week of fighting the Spanish had expended upwards of 125,000 cannonballs, but no English ship was seriously damaged."
226,"However, typhus spread fast aboard the English vessels; large numbers of English sailors died of disease or hunger, and, of the few who did survive, some died even after landing at Margate."
227,"As the Channel was blocked off, the Spanish commander Medina Sidonia decided to circle around Scotland and Ireland and retreat back to Spain."
228,"By the time the fleet arrived in Ireland, many soldiers were dying of thirst and hunger, as they had run out of supplies."
229,"Many of the surviving ships were caught in fierce storms off the west coast of Ireland, and dozens of Spanish ships were wrecked and thousands drowned or were robbed and butchered by Irish locals or English soldiers when they reached the shore."
230,"Only the Spanish nobles were spared, kept prisoner for ransom."
231,"The defeat of the Armada saved Protestant England from a Catholic reconquest, and the situation in the Netherlands became increasingly difficult to manage."
232,"Maurice of Nassau, William's son, recaptured Deventer, Groningen, Nijmegen and Zutphen."
233,"The Spanish were on the defensive, mainly because they had wasted too much resources on the attempted invasion of England and on expeditions in northern France."
234,"In 1595, King Henry IV of France declared war on Spain, further reducing Spain's ability to launch offensive warfare on the United Provinces."
235,"Faced with wars against France, England and the United Provinces, each led by capable leaders, the bankrupted Spanish empire found itself competing against strong adversaries."
236,Continuing piracy against its shipping in the Atlantic and costly colonial enterprises forced Spain to renegotiate its debts in 1596.
238,"The crown attempted to reduce its exposure to the conflicts, first signing the Treaty of Vervins with France in 1598, restoring many of the stipulations of the previous Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis."
239,Philip ceded the Spanish Netherlands to his daughter Isabella.
240,"Although the Council of the Indies was tasked with oversight there, it acted without advice of high officials with direct colonial experience."
241,Another serious problem was that the crown did not know what Spanish laws were in force there.
242,"To remedy the situation, Philip appointed Juan de Ovando, who was named President of the council, to give advice."
243,"Ovando appointed a ""chronicler and cosmographer of the Indies,"" Juan López de Velasco, to gather information about the crown's holdings, which resulted in the Relaciones geográficas in the 1580s."
244,"The crown sought greater control over encomenderos, who had attempted to establish themselves as a local aristocracy; strengthened the power of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; shored up religious orthodoxy by the establishment of the Inquisition in Lima and Mexico City (1571); and increased revenues from silver mines in Peru and in Mexico, discovered in the 1540s."
245,"In Peru, after decades of political unrest, with ineffective viceroys and encomenderos wielding undue power, weak royal institutions, a renegade Inca state existing in Vilcabamba, and waning revenue from the silver mine of Potosí, Toledo's appointment was a major step forward for royal control."
246,"He built on reforms attempted under earlier viceroys, but he is often credited with a major transformation in crown rule in Peru."
247,"Toledo formalized the labor draft of Andean commoners, the mita, to guarantee a labor supply for both the silver mine at Potosí and the mercury mine at Huancavelica."
248,"He established administrative districts of corregimiento, and resettled native Andeans in reducciones to better rule them."
249,"Under Toledo, the last stronghold of the Inca state was destroyed and the last Inca emperor, Tupac Amaru I, was executed."
250,Silver from Potosí flowed to coffers in Spain and paid for Spain's wars in Europe.
251,"In Mexico, Viceroy Enríquez organized the defense of the northern frontier against nomadic and bellicose indigenous groups, who attacked the transport lines of silver from the northern mines."
252,"In the religious sphere, the crown sought to bring the power of the religious orders under control with the Ordenanza del Patronazgo, ordering friars to give up their Indian parishes and turn them over to the diocesan clergy, who were more closely controlled by the crown."
253,The crown expanded its global claims and defended existing ones in the Indies.
254,Transpacific explorations had resulted in Spain claiming the Philippines and the establishment of Spanish settlements and trade with Mexico.
255,"The viceroyalty of Mexico was given jurisdiction over the Philippines, which became the entrepôt for Asian trade."
256,"Philip's succession to the crown of Portugal in 1580 complicated the situation on the ground in the Indies between Spanish and Portuguese settlers, although Brazil and Spanish America were administered through separate councils in Spain."
257,"Spain dealt with English encroachment on Spain's maritime control in the Indies, particularly by Sir Francis Drake and his cousin John Hawkins."
261,Spain regained control in the Isthmus of Panama by relocating the main port there from Nombre de Dios to Portobelo.
262,"In 1564, Miguel López de Legazpi was commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Don Luís de Velasco, to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean to find the Spice Islands, where earlier explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy López de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively."
263,The westward sailing to reach the sources of spices continued to be a necessity with the Ottomans still controlled major choke points in central Asia.
264,It was unclear how the agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing the Atlantic world affected finds on the other side of the Pacific.
265,"Spain had ceded its rights to the ""Spice Islands"" to Portugal in the Treaty of Saragossa in 1529, but the appellation was vague as was their exact delineation."
266,"The Legazpi expedition was ordered by King Philip II, after whom the Philippines had earlier been named by Ruy López de Villalobos, when Philip was heir to the throne."
267,"The king stated that ""the main purpose of this expediiton is to establish the return route from the western isles, since it is already known that the route to them is fairly short."""
268,"The viceroy died in July 1564, but the Audiencia and López de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition."
269,"On embarking on the expedition, Spain lacked maps or information to guide the king's decision to authorize the expedition."
270,"That realization subsequently led to the creation of reports from the various regions of the empire, the relaciones geográficas."
271,"The Philippines came under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of Mexico, and once the Manila Galleon sailings between Manila and Acapulco were established, Mexico became the Philippines' link to the larger Spanish Empire."
272,Spanish colonization began in earnest when López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first settlements in Cebu.
273,"Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian friars, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the archipelago."
275,The combined Spanish-Mexican-Filipino forces also built a Christian walled city over the burnt ruins of Muslim Maynila and made it as the new capital of the Spanish East Indies and renamed it Manila.
276,Spaniards were few and life was difficult and they were often outnumbered by their Latino recruits and Filipino allies.
277,They attempted to mobilize subordinated populations through the encomienda.
278,"Unlike in the Caribbean where the indigenous populations rapidly disappeared, the indigenous populations continued to be robust in the Philippines."
279,"Maynila's former ruler, the Muslim rajah, Rajah Sulayman, who was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei, refused to submit to Legazpi but failed to get the support of Lakan Dula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north."
280,"When Tarik Sulayman and a force of Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslim warriors attacked the Spaniards in the Battle of Bangkusay, he was finally defeated and killed."
281,The Spanish also repelled an attack by Chinese pirate warlord Limahong.
282,"Simultaneously, the establishment of a Christianized Philippines attracted Chinese traders who exchanged their silk for Mexican silver, Indian and Malay traders also settled in the Philippines too, to trade their spices and gems for the same Mexican silver."
283,The Philippines then became a center for Christian missionary activity that was also directed to Japan and the Philippines even accepted Christian converts from Japan after the Shogun persecuted them.
284,Most of the soldiers and settlers sent by the Spanish to the Philippines were either from Mexico or Peru and very little people directly came from Spain.
285,"The Spanish were joined by the newly Christianized Non-Muslim Visayans of the Kedatuan of Madja-as who were Animists and Rajahnate of Cebu who were Hindus, plus the Rajahnate of Butuan (who were from northern Mindanao and were Hindus with a Buddhist Monarchy), as well as the remnants of the Kedatuan of Dapitan who are also Animists and had previously waged war against the Islamic nations of the Sultanate of Sulu and Kingdom of Maynila."
286,"They fought against the Sultanate of Brunei and its allies, the Bruneian puppet-states of Maynila and Sulu, which had dynastic links with Brunei."
287,"The Spanish, its Mexican recruits and Filipino allies assaulted Brunei and seized its capital, Kota Batu."
288,"This was achieved partly as a result of the assistance of two noblemen, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna."
289,"The former had traveled to Manila to offer Brunei as a tributary of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal."
290,"The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new Bendahara."
292,"The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 Filipino natives and 300 Borneans."
293,"The campaign was one of many, which also included action in Mindanao and Sulu."
294,"The Spanish succeeded in invading the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna."
295,Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to Jerudong.
296,"In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei."
297,The Spanish suffered heavy losses due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak.
298,"They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days."
299,Its failure resulted in the hanging of Agustín de Legaspi and the execution of Magat Salamat (the crown-prince of Tondo).
300,"Thereafter, some of the conspirators were exiled to Guam or Guerrero, Mexico."
301,"The Spanish then conducted the centuries long Spanish–Moro conflict against the Sultanates of Maguindanao, Lanao and Sulu."
302,War was also waged against the Sultanate of Ternate and Tidore (in response to Ternatean slaving and piracy against Spain's allies: Bohol and Butuan).
303,"During the Spanish–Moro conflict, the Moros of Muslim Mindanao conducted piracy and slave-raids against Christian settlements in the Philippines."
304,The Spanish fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities such as Zamboanga City on Muslim Mindanao.
305,"The Spanish considered their war with the Muslims in Southeast Asia an extension of the Reconquista, a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the Spanish homeland which was invaded by the Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate."
306,"Some 120 Spaniards, Japanese, and Filipinos, sailing aboard three junks, launched an expedition to Cambodia."
307,"After an altercation between the Spanish expedition members and some Chinese merchants at the port left a few Chinese dead, the Spanish were forced to confront the newly declared king Anacaparan, burning much of his capital while defeating him."
309,"Another expedition, one to conquer Mindanao, was also lacking in success."
311,Philip asserted his claim to the Portuguese throne and in June sent the Duke of Alba with an army to Lisbon to assure his succession.
312,"The Duke of Alba's Spanish army defeated the Portuguese at the Battle of Alcântara on 25 August 1580, and Alba conquered the capital of Lisbon two days later."
314,"Filippo di Piero Strozzi, a Florentine mercenary, clashed with Bazán at the Battle of Ponta Delgada, off the island of São Miguel, but was defeated and killed."
317,The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires placed into Philip's hands included almost the entirety of the explored New World along with a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia.
319,"""Sea power is more important to the ruler of Spain than any other prince"", wrote one commentator, ""for it is only by sea power that a single community can be created out of so many so far apart."""
320,"A writer on tactics in 1638 observed, ""The might most suited to the arms of Spain is that which is placed on the seas, but this matter of state is so well known that I should not discuss it, even if I thought it opportune to do so."""
321,"Portugal and her kingdoms, including Brazil and her African colonies, were under the dominion of the Spanish monarch."
322,"Portugal required an extensive occupation force to keep it under control, and Spain was still reeling from the 1576 bankruptcy."
325,Portugal was brought into Spain's conflicts with rivals.
327,"Parma had suggested transporting 30,000 troops in Flanders across the English Channel to invade England."
328,"Unfavorable weather, plus heavily armed and manœuvrable English ships, and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack resulted in a defeat for the Spanish Armada."
329,"However, the failure of the Drake–Norris Expedition to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on-off 1585–1604 Anglo–Spanish War."
330,"In 1591, Spain reasserted its naval superiority at the Battle of Flores, when an attempt to capture its treasure fleet was thwarted."
331,"The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures."
332,"During the reign of Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal) in 1640, the Portuguese revolted and fought for their independence from the rest of Iberia."
333,The Council of Portugal was subsequently dissolved.
334,"Philip sought to reduce foreign conflicts, since even the vast revenues could not sustain the nearly bankrupted kingdom."
335,"The plague devastated Castilian lands between 1596 and 1602, causing the deaths of some 600,000 people."
336,A great number of Castilians went to America or died on Dutch and German battlefields.
337,"In 1609, the great majority of the Morisco population of Spain (much more numerous and unassimilated in the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon, than in the Crown of Castile or the Principality of Catalonia) was expelled."
338,It is estimated that Castile lost about 25% of its population between 1600 and 1623.
339,"The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda."
340,"However, the Genoese nobleman Ambrogio Spinola, commanding an army of mercenary Italian troops, fought in the name of Spain and repeatedly defeated the Dutchmen."
341,He was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's latest bankruptcy in 1607.
342,"In 1609, the Twelve Years' Truce was signed between Spain and the United Provinces."
344,"Spain made a fair recovery during the truce, putting its finances in order and doing much to restore its prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play a leading part."
345,"The Duke of Lerma (and to a large extent Philip II) had been uninterested in the affairs of their ally, Austria."
346,"In 1618, the king replaced him with Don Baltasar de Zúñiga, a veteran ambassador to Vienna."
347,Don Balthasar believed that the key to restraining the resurgent French and eliminating the Dutch was a closer alliance with Habsburg Monarchy.
348,"In 1618, beginning with the Defenestration of Prague, Austria and the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, embarked on a campaign against the Protestant Union and Bohemia."
349,"Don Balthasar encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army in the Netherlands, was sent at the head of the Army of Flanders to intervene."
350,"Thus, Spain entered into the Thirty Years' War."
351,The learned arbitristas sent the king more analyses of Spain's problems and possible solutions.
352,"As an illustration of the precarious economic situation of Spain at the time, it was actually Dutch bankers who financed the East India merchants of Seville."
353,"At the same time, everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and settlements were undermining Spanish and Portuguese hegemony."
354,"The Dutch were religiously tolerant and not evangelical, focusing on trade, as opposed to Spain's longstanding defense of Catholicism."
356,Spain badly needed time and peace to repair its finances and to rebuild its economy.
357,"In 1622, Don Balthasar was replaced by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, a reasonably honest and able man."
358,"After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at White Mountain in 1621, and again at Stadtlohn in 1623."
359,The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of Breda in 1625.
360,"The intervention of Christian IV of Denmark in the war threatened the Spanish position, but the victory of the Imperial general Albert of Wallenstein over the Danes at Dessau Bridge and again at Lutter (both in 1626), eliminated that threat."
361,"There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the Empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed crushed."
362,"France was once again involved in its own instabilities, and Spain's eminence seemed clear."
363,"Olivares aimed for ""peace with honor"", however, which meant in practice a peace settlement that would have restored to Spain something of its predominant position in the Netherlands."
364,"This was unacceptable to the United Provinces, and the inevitable consequence was the constant hope that one more victory would finally lead to ""peace with honor"", perpetuating the ruinous war that Olivares had wanted to avoid to begin with."
365,"In 1625, Olivares proposed the Union of Arms, which aimed at raising revenues from the Indies and other kingdoms of Iberia for imperial defense, which met strong opposition."
366,The Union of Arms was the sparking point for a major revolt in Catalonia in 1640.
367,"This turmoil also seemed a propitious moment for the Portuguese to revolt against Habsburg rule, with the Duke of Braganza proclaimed as John IV of Portugal."
368,"While Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, the war seemed to go in Spain's favor."
369,But in 1627 the Castilian economy collapsed.
370,"The Habsburg had been debasing their currency to pay for the war and prices exploded, just as they had in previous years in Austria."
371,"Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a barter economy owing to the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry and had to depend on revenue from its colonies."
372,"The Spanish armies, like others in German territories, resorted to ""paying themselves"" on the land."
373,"Olivares had backed certain taxation reforms in Spain pending the end of the war, but was blamed for another embarrassing and fruitless war in Italy."
374,"The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years' Truce had made increasing their navy a priority, (which showed its maturing potency at the Battle of Gibraltar 1607), managed to strike a great blow against Spanish maritime trade with the capture by captain Piet Hein of the Spanish treasure fleet on which Spain had become dependent after the economic collapse."
375,"Spanish military resources were stretched across Europe and also at sea as they sought to protect maritime trade against the greatly improved Dutch and French fleets, while still occupied with the Ottoman and associated Barbary pirate threat in the Mediterranean."
376,In the meantime the aim of choking Dutch shipping was carried out by the Dunkirkers with considerable success.
377,"In 1625 a Spanish-Portuguese fleet, under Admiral Fadrique de Toledo, regained the strategically vital Brazilian city of Salvador da Bahia from the Dutch."
378,"Elsewhere, the isolated and undermanned Portuguese forts in Africa and Asia proved vulnerable to Dutch and English raids and takeovers or simply being bypassed as important trading posts."
379,"In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, one of history's most noted commanders, landed in Germany and relieved the port of Stralsund, the last continental stronghold of German forces belligerent to the Emperor."
380,"Gustavus then marched south and won notable victories at Breitenfeld and Lützen, attracting more Protestant support with every step he took."
381,By 1633 Spain was deeply involved in saving their Austrian allies from the Swedes who had continued to be wildly successful despite the death of Gustavus at Lützen in 1632.
382,"In early September 1634, a Spanish army that had marched from Italy linked with the Imperials at the town of Nördlingen, bringing their total to 33,000 troops."
383,"Having severely underestimated the number of experienced Spanish soldiers in the reinforcements, the commanders of the Protestant armies of the Heilbronn League decided to offer battle."
384,The seasoned Spanish infantry — which had not been present at any of the battles that had ended in Swedish victories — was mostly responsible for the complete rout of the enemy army.
385,"Alarmed by the Spanish success at the Battle of Nördlingen and the probable collapse of the Swedish military effort, Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of Louis XIII, realized that it would be necessary to turn the existing cold war into a hot one if Spain, in conjunction with the Austrian Habsburgs, was to be stopped from dominating Europe."
386,"The French won the Battle of Les Avins in Belgium on 20 May 1635, an early success, but the Spanish defeated a joint Franco-Dutch invasion of the Spanish Netherlands before Spanish and Imperial armies cut through Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne."
387,"However, the Spanish offensive stalled before Paris could be targeted, and the French launched counterattacks that drove the Spanish back into Flanders."
388,"In February 1637, Admiral Miguel de Horna, commander of the Armada of Flanders, fought a bloody battle with a Dutch convoy met off the coast of Cornwall, capturing fourteen merchantmen and three warships."
389,"In August, Salvador Rodríguez led a raid on the Shetland fishing grounds, which took a toll of thirty-five herring busses."
390,"At the Battle of the Downs in 1639, a large Spanish fleet (100 ships; 2,000 guns; 20,000 men) was destroyed off the coast of Kent by the Dutch, and the Spanish found themselves unable to supply and reinforce their forces adequately in the Netherlands."
391,"According to Geoffrey Parker, the Army of Flanders received 8,000 Castilian reinforcements each year during the Eighty Years' War, and 30,000 Castilian soldiers were mobilized between 1631 and 1639."
392,"In 1643, the Army of Flanders, commanded by Francisco de Melo, suffered defeat in northern France at the Battle of Rocroi."
393,The battle was one of the few major battlefield defeats of a Spanish army in over a century.
394,"The Peace of Westphalia ended the Spanish-Dutch War in 1648, with Spain recognizing the independence of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands."
395,The Spanish had to be paid to leave positions they had seized on the Rhine.
396,"The Franco-Spanish War continued for eleven more years, in the course of which England joined in on the side of France."
397,"In 1640, Spain had already experienced the loss of Portugal, following its revolt against Spanish rule, and brought to an end the Iberian Union, and the establishment of the House of Braganzaunder king John IV of Portugal."
398,"He had received widespread support from the Portuguese people, and Spain was unable to respond, since it was at war with France and Catalonia revolted that year."
400,"When John died in 1656, the Spanish attempted to wrest Portugal from his son Alfonso VI of Portugal but were defeated at the Battle of Ameixial (1663) and the Battle of Montes Claros (1665), leading to Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence in 1668, during the regency of Philip IV's young heir, Charles II, who was seven at the time."
401,"Although France suffered from a civil war from 1648 to 1652, Spain had been exhausted by the Thirty Years' War and the ongoing revolts."
402,"With the war against the United Provinces at an end in 1648, the Spanish drove the French out of Naples and Catalonia in 1652, recaptured Dunkirk, and occupied several northern French forts that they held until peace was made."
403,"The war came to an end soon after the Battle of the Dunes (1658), where the French army under Viscount Turenne retook Dunkirk."
404,Spain agreed to the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ceded to France the Spanish Netherlands territory of Artois and the northern Catalan county of Roussillon.
405,"France was now the dominant power on continental Europe, and the United Provinces were dominant in the Atlantic."
407,"Sevilla, and indeed the economy of Andalucía, would never recover from such complete devastation."
409,"Although the islands' loss barely diminished its American territories, the islands were strategically located and held political, military, and economic advantages in the long run."
410,"Spain's main Caribbean strongholds of Cuba and Puerto Rico remained in crown hands, but Windward Islands and Leeward Islands which Spain claimed but did not occupy were vulnerable."
412,"The French settled in the West Indies in Martinique and Guadeloupe in 1635; and the Dutch acquired trading bases in Curaçao, St Eustace, and St Martin."
413,"Charles became monarch in 1665 when he was four years old, so a regency of his mother and a five-member government junta ruled in his name, headed by his natural half-brother John of Austria."
417,"French forces led by the Duke of Luxembourg defeated the Spanish at Fleurus (1690) and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under William III of Orange, who fought on Spain's side."
418,"The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation, including the important cities of Ghent and Luxembourg."
419,The war revealed to Europe the vulnerability of the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy.
420,"Further, the ineffective Spanish Habsburg government took no action to improve them."
421,Spain suffered utter decay and stagnation during the final decades of the seventeenth century.
422,While the rest of Western Europe went through exciting changes in government and society – the Glorious Revolution in England and the reign of the Sun King in France – Spain remained adrift.
423,"The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent Charles I and Philip II demanded a strong and hardworking monarch; the weakness and lack of interest of Philip III and Philip IV contributed to Spain's decay."
424,"Charles II was childless and weak ruler, known as ""The Bewitched."""
425,"In his last will and testament he left his throne to a French prince, the Bourbon Philip of Anjou, rather than to another Habsburg."
426,"This resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession, with the Habsburg Monarchy, the Dutch and the English challenging Charles II's choice of a Bourbon prince to succeed him as king."
427,"When these territories reach a high level of importance, the crown established the Council of the Indies in 1524, following the conquest of the Aztec empire, asserting permanent royal control over its possessions."
428,"Regions with dense indigenous populations and sources of mineral wealth attracting Spanish settlers became colonial centers, while those without such resources were peripheral to crown interest."
429,"Once regions incorporated into the empire and their importance assessed, overseas possessions came under stronger or weaker crown control."
430,"The crown learned its lesson with the rule of Christopher Columbus and his heirs in the Caribbean, and they never subsequently gave authorization of sweeping powers to explorers and conquerors."
431,"The Catholic Monarchs' conquest of Granada in 1492 and their expulsion of the Jews ""were militant expressions of religious statehood at the moment of the beginning of the American colonization."""
432,"The crown's power in the religious sphere was absolute in its overseas possessions through the papacy's grant of the Patronato real, and ""Catholicism was indissolubly linked with royal authority."""
433,"Church-State relations were established in the conquest era and remained stable until the end of the Habsburg era in 1700, when the Bourbon monarchs implemented major reforms and changed the relationship between crown and altar."
434,"The crown's administration of its overseas empire was implemented by royal officials in both the civil and religious spheres, often with overlapping jurisdictions."
435,The crown could administer the empire in the Indies by using native elites as intermediaries with the large indigenous populations.
436,"Administrative costs of empire were kept low, with a small number of Spanish officials generally paid low salaries."
437,"Crown policy to maintain a closed commercial system limited to one port in Spain and only a few in the Indies was in practice not closed, with European merchant houses supplying Spanish merchants in the Spanish port of Seville with high quality textiles and other manufactured goods that Spain itself could not supply."
438,Much of the silver of the Indies was diverted into those European merchant houses.
439,Crown officials in the Indies enabled the creation of a whole commercial system in which they could coerce native populations to participate while reaping profits themselves in cooperation with merchants.
444,"This territory later became the Viceroyalty of New Spain, present day Mexico."
445,"Of equal importance was the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire by Francisco Pizarro, which would become the Viceroyalty of Peru."
446,"After the conquest of Mexico, rumors of golden cities (Quivira and Cíbola in North America and El Dorado in South America) motivated several other expeditions."
447,"Many of those returned without having found their goal, or finding it much less valuable than was hoped."
448,"Indeed, the New World colonies only began to yield a substantial part of the Crown's revenues with the establishment of mines such as that of Potosí (Bolivia) and Zacatecas (Mexico) both started in 1546."
449,"By the late 16th century, silver from the Americas accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget."
450,Eventually the world's stock of precious metal was doubled or even tripled by silver from the Americas.
451,Official records indicate that at least 75% of the silver was taken across the Atlantic to Spain and no more than 25% across the Pacific to China.
452,Some modern researchers argue that due to rampant smuggling about 50% went to China.
453,Saint Augustine quickly became a strategic defensive base for the Spanish ships full of gold and silver being sent to Spain from its New World dominions.
454,"The Portuguese mariner sailing for Castile, Ferdinand Magellan, died while in the Philippines commanding a Castilian expedition in 1522, which was the first to circumnavigate the globe."
455,The Basque commander Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition to success.
456,"Spain sought to enforce their rights in the Moluccan islands, which led a conflict with the Portuguese, but the issue was resolved with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1525), settling the location of the antimeridian of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres."
457,"From then on, maritime expeditions led to the discovery of several archipelagos in the South Pacific as the Pitcairn Islands, the Marquesas, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands or New Guinea, to which Spain laid claim."
458,"Most important in Pacific exploration was the claim on the Philippines, which was populous and strategically located for the Spanish settlement of Manila and entrepôt for trade with China."
460,The Manila Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to Acapulco on the coast of Mexico.
461,"From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the Spanish treasure fleets, for shipment to Spain."
462,The Spanish trading port of Manila facilitated this trade in 1572.
463,"Although Spain claimed islands in the Pacific, it did not encounter or claim the Hawaiian Islands."
464,"The control of Guam, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, and Palau came later, from the end of the 17th century, and remained under Spanish control until 1898."
465,"In the 18th century, Spain was concerned with increasing Russian and British influence in the Pacific Northwest of North America and sent several expeditions to explore and further shore up Spanish claims to the region."
466,"Royal law and Catholicism codified and maintained hierarchies of class and race , while all were subjects of the crown and mandated to be Catholic."
467,"The crown took active steps to establish and maintain Catholicism by evangelizing the pagan indigenous populations, as well as African slaves not previously Christian, and incorporating them into Christendom."
468,The Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spanish America.
469,"The crown also imposed restrictions on emigration to the Americas, excluding Jews and crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners, using the Casa de Contratación to vet potential emigres and issue licenses to travel."
470,The portrait to the right was most likely used as a souvenir.
471,For those who traveled to the New World and back it was common to bring back souvenirs as there were a great interest in what the New World meant.
472,The land would be significantly different but there was a special emphasis put on the emerging mixed races.
473,Not only was there whites mixing with blacks but there were natives mixing with both whites and blacks as well.
474,"From a Spanish viewpoint, the castas paintings would most-likely have provided a sort of sense to the madness that was mixed races."
475,There were political implications of this portrait as well.
476,"Once those issues were resolved theologically, in practice the crown sought to protect its new vassals."
477,"It did so by dividing peoples of the Americas into the República de Indios, the native populations, and the República de Españoles."
478,"The República de Españoles was the entire Hispanic sector, composed of Spaniards, but also Africans (enslaved and free), as well as mixed-race castas."
479,"Within the República de Indios, men were explicitly excluded from ordination to the Catholic priesthood and obligation for military service as well as the jurisdiction of the Inquisition."
480,Indians under colonial rule who lived in pueblos de indios had crown protections due to their statuses as legal minors.
481,"Due to the lack of prior exposure to the Catholic faith, Queen Isabella had declared all indigenous peoples her subjects."
482,This differed from people of the African continent because these populations had theoretically been exposed to Catholicism and chose not to follow it.
483,This religious differentiation is important because it gave indigenous communities legal protections from members of the Républica de Españoles.
484,"In fact, an often overlooked aspect of the colonial legal system was that members of the pueblos de indios could appeal to the crown and circumvent the legal system in the Républica de Españoles."
485,"The statuses of the indigenous populations as legal minors barred them from becoming priests, but the républica de indios operated with a fair amount of autonomy."
486,Missionaries also acted as guardians against encomendero exploitation.
487,"Indian communities had protections of traditional lands by the creation of community lands that could not be alienated, the fondo legal."
488,"They managed their own affairs internally through Indian town government under the supervision of royal officials, the corregidores and alcaldes mayores."
489,"Although indigenous men were barred from becoming priests, indigenous communities created religious confraternaties under priestly supervision, which functioned as burial societies for their individual members, but also organized community celebrations for their patron saint."
490,"The first order to make the trip to the Americas were the Franciscans, led by Pedro de Gante."
491,Franciscans believed that living a spiritual life of poverty and holiness was the best way to be an example that inspired others to convert.
492,The friars would walk into the towns barefoot as a display of their surrender to God in a sort of theater of conversion.
493,With this began the practice of evangelization of the peoples of the new world as supported by the Spanish government.
494,"Religious orders in Spanish America had their own internal structures and were organizationally autonomous, but nonetheless were very important to the structure of colonial society."
495,They had their own resources and hierarchies.
496,"Though some orders took vows of poverty, by the time the second wave of friars came to the Americas and as their numbers grew, the orders began amassing wealth and thus became key economic players."
497,"The church, as this wealthy power, had huge estates and built large constructions such as gilded monasteries and cathedrals."
498,Priests themselves also became wealthy landowners.
499,"Orders like the Franciscans also established schools for the indigenous elites as well as hired indigenous laborers, thereby shifting the dynamics in the indigenous communities and their relationship to the Spanish."
500,"After the fall of the Aztec and Inca empires, the rulers of the empires were replaced by the Spanish monarchy, while retaining much of the hierarchical indigenous structures."
501,"The crown recognized noble status of elite Indians, giving them exemption from the head-tax and the right to use the nobles title don and doña."
502,"Indigenous noblemen were a key group for the administration of the Spanish Empire, since they served as intermediaries between crown officials and indigenous communities."
503,"Indigenous noblemen could serve on cabildos, ride horses, and carry firearms."
504,The crown's recognition of indigenous elites as nobles meant that these men were incorporated into colonial system with privileges separating them from Indian commoners.
505,Indian noblemen were thus crucial to the governance of the huge indigenous population.
506,"Through their continued loyalty to the crown, they maintained their positions of power within their communities but also served as agents of colonial governance."
507,The Spanish Empire's utilization of local elites to rule large populations that are ethnically distinct from the rulers has long been practiced by earlier empires.
508,"Indian caciques were crucial in the early Spanish period, especially when the economy was still based on extracting tribute and labor from commoner Indians who had rendered goods and service to their overlords in the prehispanic period."
509,"Caciques mobilized their populations for encomenderos and, later, repartimiento recipients chosen by the crown."
510,"The noblemen became the officers of the cabildo in indigenous communities, regulating internal affairs, as well as defending the communities’ rights in court."
511,"In Mexico, this was facilitated by the 1599 establishment of the General Indian Court (Juzgado General de Indios), which heard legal disputes in which indigenous communities and individuals were engaged."
512,"With legal mechanisms for dispute-resolution, there were relatively few outbreaks of violence and rebellion against crown rule."
513,"Eighteenth-century rebellions in long-peaceful areas of Mexico, the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 and most spectacularly in Peru with the Tupac Amaru Rebellion (1780–81) saw indigenous noblemen leading uprisings against the Spanish state."
514,"In the República de Españoles, class and race hierarchies were codified in institutional structures."
515,"Spaniards emigrating to The Indies were to be Old Christians of pure Christian heritage, with the crown excluding New Christians, converts from Judaism and their descendants, because of their suspect religious status."
516,"The crown established the Inquisition in Mexico and Peru in 1571, and later Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), to guard Catholics from the influence of crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners."
517,"Church practices established and maintained racial hierarchies  by recording baptism, marriage, and burial were kept separate registers for different racial groups."
518,Churches were also physically divided by race.
519,"Race mixture (mestizaje) was a fact of colonial society, with the three racial groups, European whites (españoles), Africans (negros), and Indians (indios) producing mixed-race offspring, or castas."
520,"There was a pyramid of racial status  with the apex being the small number of European white (españoles), a slightly larger number of mixed-race castas, who, like the whites were mainly urban dwelling, and the largest populations were Indians living in communities in the countryside."
521,"Although Indians were classified as part of the Repúbica de Indios, their offspring of unions with Españoles and Africans were castas."
522,"White-Indian mixtures were more socially acceptable in the Hispanic sphere, with the possibility over generations of mixed-race offspring being classified as Español."
523,"Any offspring with African ancestry could never remove the ""stain"" of their racial heritage, since Africans were seen as ""natural slaves."""
524,"Non-whites (blacks and mixed-race castas) were far more often and more severely punished , while Indians, considered legal minors, were not expected to behave better and were more leniently punished."
525,"Royal and municipal legislation attempted to control the behavior of black slaves, who were subject to a curfew, could not carry arms, and were prohibited from running away from their masters."
526,"As the urban, white, lower-class (plebeian) population increased, they too were increasingly subject to criminal arrest and punishment."
527,"Capital punishment was seldom employed, with the exception of sodomy and recalcitrant prisoners of the Inquisition, whose deviation from Christian orthodoxy was considered extreme."
528,"However, only the civil sphere could exercise capital punishment and prisoners were ""relaxed,"" that is, released to civil authorities."
529,"Often criminals served sentences of hard labor in textile workshops (obrajes), presidio service on the frontier, and as sailors on royal ships."
530,One important privilege was their being judged by the court of their corporation.
531,"Members of the clergy held the fuero eclesiástico were judged by ecclesiastical courts, whether the offense was civil or criminal."
532,"In the eighteenth century the crown established a standing military and with it, special privileges (fuero militar)."
533,The privilege extended to the military was the first fuero extended to the non-whites who served the crown.
534,Indians had a form of corporate privilege through their membership in indigenous communities.
535,"In central Mexico, the crown established a special Indian court (Juzgado General de Indios), and legal fees, including access to lawyers, were funded by a special tax."
536,"The crown extended the peninsular institution of the merchant guild (consulado) first established in Spain, including Seville (1543), and later established in Mexico City and Peru."
537,"Consulado membership was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards, usually members of transatlantic commercial houses."
538,"The consulados’ tribunals heard disputes over contracts, bankruptcy, shipping, insurance and the like and became a wealthy and powerful economic institution and source of loans to the viceroyalties."
539,Transatlantic trade remained in the hands of mercantile families based in Spain and the Indies.
540,"The men in the Indies were often younger relatives of the merchants in Spain, who often married wealthy American-born women."
541,"American-born Spanish men (criollos) in general did not pursue commerce but instead owned landed estates, entered the priesthood, or became a professional."
542,"In the Bourbon era, for the first time there was a distinction made between Iberian-born and American-born Spaniards, In the Habsburg era, in law and ordinary speech they were grouped together without distinction."
543,"Increasingly American-born Spaniards developed a distinctly local focus, with peninsular-born (peninsulares) Spaniards increasingly seen as outsiders and resented, but this was a development in the late colonial period."
544,"Resentment against peninsulares was due to a deliberate change in crown policy, which systematically favored them over American-born criollos for high positions in the civil and religious hierarchies."
545,This left criollos only the membership in a city or town's cabildo.
546,"When the secularizing Bourbon monarchy pursued policies strengthening secular royal power over religious power, it attacked the fuero eclesiástico, which for many members of the lower clergy was a significant privilege."
547,Parish priests who had functioned as royal officials as well as clerics in Indian towns lost their privileged position.
548,"At the same time the crown established a standing army and promoted militias for the defense of empire, creating a new avenue of privilege for creole men and for castas, but excluding indigenous men from conscription or voluntary service."
549,"Given that, the crown attempted to create and maintain a classic, closed mercantile system, warding off competitors and keeping wealth within the empire."
550,"While the Habsburgs were committed to maintaining a state monopoly in theory, in reality the Empire was a porous economic realm and smuggling was widespread."
551,"In the 16th and 17th century under the Habsburgs, Spain experienced a gradual decline in economic conditions, especially relative to the industrial development of its French, Dutch, and English rivals."
552,"Many of the goods being exported to the Empire originated from manufacturers in northwest Europe, rather than in Spain."
553,But illicit commercial activities became a part of the Empire's administrative structure.
554,"Supported by large flows of silver from America, trade prohibited by Spanish mercantilist trade restrictions flourished, because it provided a source of income to both crown officials and private merchants."
555,"The local administrative structure in Buenos Aires, for example, was established through its oversight of both legal and illegal commerce."
556,In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs.
557,"The crown's pursuit of wars to maintain and expand territory, defend the Catholic faith and stamp out Protestantism, and beat back Ottoman Turkish strength outstripped its ability to pay for it all, despite the huge production of silver in Peru and Mexico."
558,Most of that flow paid mercenary soldiers in the European religious wars in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and into foreign merchants’ hands to pay for the consumer goods manufactured in northern Europe.
559,Paradoxically the wealth of the Indies impoverished Spain and enriched northern Europe.
560,"According to these thinkers, ""Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked."
561,"The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated."
562,"In this way alone could Castile's productivity increased, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end."
565,"Shipping was through particular ports in Spain (Seville, subsequently Cadiz), Spanish America (Veracruz, Acapulco, Havana, Cartagena de Indias, and Callao/Lima) and the Philippines (Manila)."
566,Spanish settlers in the Indies in the very early period were few and Spain could supply sufficient goods to them.
567,"But as the Aztec and Inca empires were conquered in the early sixteenth century and then large deposits of silver found in both Mexico and Peru, the regions of those major empires, Spanish immigration increased and demand for goods rose far beyond Spain's ability to supply it."
568,"Since Spain had little capital to invest in the expanding trade and no significant commercial group, bankers and commercial houses in Genoa, Germany, The Netherlands, France, and England supplied both investment capital and goods in a supposedly closed system."
569,"Even in the sixteenth century, Spain recognized that the idealized closed system did not function in reality."
570,"Despite that the crown did not alter its restrictive structure or advocacy of fiscal prudence, despite the pleas of the arbitristas, the Indies trade remained nominally in the hands of Spain, but in fact enriched the other European countries."
572,Merchants in Seville conveyed consumer goods that were registered and taxed by the House of Trade.
573,were sent to the Indies were produced in other European countries.
574,"Other European commercial interests came to dominate supply, with Spanish merchant houses and their guilds (consulados) in Spain and the Indies acting as mere middlemen, reaping profits a slice of the profits."
575,"However, those profits did not promote Spanish economic development of a manufacturing sector, with its economy continuing to be based on agriculture."
576,"The wealth of the Indies led to prosperity in northern Europe, particularly The Netherlands and England, both Protestant."
577,"As Spain's power weakened in the seventeenth century, England, The Netherlands, and the French took advantage overseas by seizing islands in the Caribbean, which became bases for a burgeoning contraband trade in Spanish America."
578,"Crown officials who were supposed to suppress contraband trade were quite often in cahoots with the foreigners, since it was a source of personal enrichment."
579,"In Spain, the crown itself participated in collusion with foreign merchant houses, since they paid fines, ""meant to establish a compensation to the state for losses through fraud."""
580,it became for merchant houses a calculated risk for doing business; for the crown it gained income it would have lost otherwise.
581,Foreigner merchants were part of the supposed monopoly system of trade.
582,"The mines in Peru and Mexico were in the hands of a few elite mining entrepreneurs, with access to capital and a stomach for the risk mining entailed."
583,"They operated under a system of royal licensing, since the crown held the rights to subsoil wealth."
584,"Mining entrepreneurs assumed all the risk of the enterprise, while the crown gained a 20% slice of the profits, the royal fifth (""Quinto"")."
585,"Further adding to the crown's revenues was mining was that it crown held a monopoly on the supply of mercury, used for separating pure silver from silver ore in the patio process."
586,"The crown kept the price high, thereby depressing the volume of silver production."
587,Protecting its flow from Mexico and Peru as it transited to ports for shipment to Spain resulted early on in a convoy system (the flota) sailing twice a year.
588,"Its success can be judged by the fact that the silver fleet was captured only once, in 1628 by Dutch privateer Piet Hein."
589,That loss resulted in the bankruptcy of the Spanish crown and an extended period of economic depression in Spain.
590,One practice used by the Spanish to gather workers for the mines was called repartimiento.
591,This was a rotational forced labor system where indigenous pueblos were obligated to send laborers to work in Spanish mines and plantations for a set number of days out of the year.
592,"Repartimiento was not implemented to replace slave labor but instead existed alongside free wage labor, slavery, and indentured labor."
593,"It was, however, a way for the Spanish to procure cheap labor thus boosting the mining-driven economy."
594,It is important to note that the men who worked as repartimiento laborers were not always resistant to the practice.
595,"Some were drawn to the labor as a way to supplement the wages they earned cultivating fields so as to support their families and, of course, pay tributes."
596,"At first, a Spaniard could get repartimiento laborers to work for them with permission from a crown official, such as a viceroy,  only on the basis that this labor was absolutely necessary to provide the country with important resources."
597,This condition became laxer as the years went on and various enterprises had repartimiento laborers where they would work in dangerous conditions for long hours and low wages.
598,"During the Bourbon era, economic reforms sought to reverse the pattern that left Spain impoverished with no manufacturing sector and its colonies’ need for manufactured goods supplied by other nations."
599,"It attempted to restructure to establish as closed trading system, but it was hampered by the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht."
600,The treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession with a victory for the Bourbon French candidate for the throne had a provision for the British to legally sell by a license (Asiento de Negros) slaves to Spanish America.
601,The provision undermined the possibility of a revamped Spanish monopoly system.
602,The merchants also used the opportunity to engage in contraband trade of their manufactured goods.
603,Crown policy sought to make legal trade more appealing than contraband by instituting free commerce (comercio libre) in 1778 whereby Spanish American ports could trade with each other and they could trade with any port in Spain.
604,It was aimed at revamping a closed Spanish system and outflanking the increasingly powerful British.
605,"Silver production revived in the eighteenth century, with production far surpassing the earlier output."
606,"The crown reducing the taxes on mercury, meaning that a greater volume of pure silver could be refined."
607,"Silver mining absorbed most available capital in Mexico and Peru, and the crown emphasized the production of precious metals that was sent to Spain."
608,"There was some economic development in the Indies to supply food, but a diversified economy did not emerge."
609,The economic reforms of the Bourbon era both shaped and were themselves impacted by geopolitical developments in Europe.
610,The Bourbon Reforms arose out of the War of the Spanish Succession.
611,"In turn, the crown's attempt to tighten its control over its colonial markets in the Americas led to further conflict with other European powers who were vying for access to them."
613,"In the Americas, meanwhile, economic policies enacted under the Bourbons had different impacts in different regions."
614,"On one hand, silver production in New Spain greatly increased and led to economic growth."
615,"But much of the profits of the revitalized mining sector went to mining elites and state officials, while in rural areas of New Spain conditions for rural workers deteriorated, contributing to social unrest that would impact subsequent revolts."
616,"The settlement gave spoils to those who had backed a Habsburg for the Spanish monarchy, ceding European territory of the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and parts of Milan to the Duchy of Savoy, and Gibraltar and Menorca to the Kingdom of Great Britain."
618,"However, this recovery was not then translated into institutional improvement, rather the ""proximate solutions to permanent problems."""
619,This legacy of neglect was reflected in the early years of Bourbon rule in which the military was ill-advisedly pitched into battle in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720).
620,"The poor performance of the Spanish military is well illustrated by the Battle of Cape Passaro, off the coast of Sicily, where a Spanish fleet was destroyed by the British."
622,"Following the war, the new Bourbon monarchy took a much more cautious approach to international relations, relying on a family alliance with Bourbon France, and continuing to follow a program of institutional renewal."
623,The crown program to enact reforms that promoted administrative control and efficiency in the metropole to the detriment of interests in the colonies undermined creole elites' loyalty to the crown.
624,"When French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Iberian peninsula in 1808, Napoleon ousted the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, placing his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne."
625,"There was a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule in Spanish America, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826)."
626,"It sought to increase revenues and to assert greater crown control, including over the Catholic Church."
627,Centralization of power was to be for the benefit of the crown and the metropole and for the defense of its empire against foreign incursions.
628,"From the viewpoint of Spain, the structures of colonial rule under the Habsburgs were no longer functioning to the benefit of Spain, with much wealth being retained in Spanish America and going to other European powers."
630,Cadiz became the one port for all Indies trading (see flota system).
631,"Individual sailings at regular intervals were slow to displace the traditional armed convoys, but by the 1760s there were regular ships plying the Atlantic from Cadiz to Havana and Puerto Rico, and at longer intervals to the Río de la Plata, where an additional viceroyalty was created in 1776."
632,The contraband trade that was the lifeblood of the Habsburg empire declined in proportion to registered shipping (a shipping registry having been established in 1735).
633,"Two upheavals registered unease within Spanish America and at the same time demonstrated the renewed resiliency of the reformed system: the Tupac Amaru uprising in Peru in 1780 and the rebellion of the comuneros of New Granada, both in part reactions to tighter, more efficient control."
634,Spain's victory in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741) against a British expedition in the Caribbean port of Cartagena de Indias helped Spain secure its dominance of its possessions in America until the 19th century.
635,"But different regions fared differently under Bourbon rule, and even while New Spain was particularly prosperous, it was also marked by steep wealth inequality."
636,"Silver production boomed in New Spain during the 18th century, with output more than tripling between the start of the century and the 1750s."
637,"The economy and the population both grew, both centered around Mexico City."
638,"But while mine owners and the crown benefited from the flourishing silver economy, most of the population in the rural Bajío faced rising land prices, falling wages."
639,"Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), reflecting in part the success of the Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control."
640,"With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s."
641,The end of Cadiz's monopoly of trade with America brought about a rebirth of Spanish manufactures.
642,Most notable was the rapidly growing textile industry of Catalonia which by the mid-1780s saw the first signs of industrialization.
643,"This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in Barcelona."
644,This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood in stark contrast to the relative backwardness of most of the country.
645,"Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as Cuba, with its tobacco plantations, and a renewed growth of precious metals mining in America."
646,"On the other hand, most of rural Spain and its empire, where the great bulk of the population lived, lived in relatively backward conditions by 18th-century West European standards, reinforced old customs and isolation."
647,"Agricultural productivity remained low despite efforts to introduce new techniques to what was for the most part an uninterested, exploited peasant and laboring groups."
648,Governments were inconsistent in their policies.
649,"Though there were substantial improvements by the late 18th century, Spain was still an economic backwater."
650,"Under the mercantile trading arrangements it had difficulty in providing the goods being demanded by the strongly growing markets of its empire, and providing adequate outlets for the return trade."
651,"From an opposing point of view according to the ""backwardness"" mentioned above the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt traveled extensively throughout the Spanish Americas, exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific point of view between 1799 and 1804."
652,In his work Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico he says that the Indians of New Spain lived in better conditions than any Russian or German peasant in Europe.
653,"Mexico City consumed 189 pounds of meat per person per year, in comparison to 163 pounds consumed by the inhabitants of Paris, the Mexicans also consumed almost the same amount of bread as any European city, with 363 kilograms of bread per person per year in comparison to the 377 kilograms consumed in Paris."
654,Caracas consumed seven times more meat per person than in Paris.
655,Von Humboldt also said that the average income in that period was four times the European income and also that the cities of New Spain were richer than many European cities.
656,"The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy, and the demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed."
657,It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored.
658,But time was to be against it.
660,"The British, also occupied with France, were unable to capture Spanish convoys, and Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes."
661,"In Europe, Spain had been trying to divest Maria Theresa of Lombardy in northern Italy since 1741, but faced the opposition of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, and warfare in northern Italy remained indecisive throughout the period up to 1746."
663,Spain was defeated during the invasion of Portugal and lost both Havana and Manila to British forces towards the end of the Seven Years' War (1756–63).
664,"However, it promptly recovered these losses and seized the British naval base in the Bahamas during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83)."
665,"During most of the 18th century, Spanish privateers were the scourge of the Antilles, with Dutch, British, French and Danish vessels as their prizes."
666,In 1783 and 1784 the Spanish navy bombarded Algiers to end piracy in the Mediterranean.
667,The second bombardment under Admiral Antonio Barceló damaged the city so severely that the Dey of Algiers negotiated a peace treaty.
668,"Admiral Luis de Córdova y Córdova captured two British convoys totaling seventy-nine ships, including a fleet of fifty-five merchantmen and frigates in the Action of 9 August 1780."
669,"The Spanish governor of Louisiana Bernardo de Gálvez launched several successful offensives against British Florida, capturing the entirety of West Florida from Britain."
670,"Spain and France were allies because of the Bourbon ""Family Pact"" carried out by both countries against Britain."
671,Gálvez also conquered the island New Providence in the Bahamas.
672,Jamaica was the last British stronghold of importance in the Caribbean.
673,"Gálvez attempted to organize a expedition to capture the island; however, the 1783 Peace of Paris was concluded and the invasion cancelled."
674,Under royal order from Charles III of Spain Gálvez continued the aid operations to supply the American rebels.
675,"The British blockaded the colonial ports of the Thirteen Colonies, and the route from Spanish-controlled New Orleans up to the Mississippi river was an effective alternative to supply the American rebels."
676,"Spain actively supported the thirteen colonies throughout the American Revolutionary War, beginning in 1776 by jointly funding Roderigue Hortalez and Company, a trading company that provided critical military supplies, throughout financing the final Siege of Yorktown in 1781 with a collection of gold and silver from Havana."
677,"Spanish aid was supplied to the colonies via four main routes: from French ports with the funding of Roderigue Hortalez and Company; through the port of New Orleans and up the Mississippi river; from warehouses in Havana; and (4)from the northwestern Spanish port of Bilbao, through the Gardoqui family trading company which supplied significant war materiel."
678,"Many Spanish expeditions explored large parts of this vast region, especially those close to Spanish settlements."
679,"During the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish soldiers, missionaries and adventurers also established pioneering communities, primarily in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo, and forts on the northeastern coast threatened by the French and Dutch."
680,"As Portuguese-Brazilian settlement expanded, following in the trail of the Bandeirantes exploits, these isolated Spanish groups were eventually integrated into Brazilian society."
681,"Only some Castilians who were displaced from the disputed areas of the Pampas of Rio Grande do Sul have left a significant influence on the formation of the gaucho, when they mixed with Indian groups, Portuguese and blacks who arrived in the region during the 18th century."
682,"The Spanish were barred by their laws from slaving of indigenous people, leaving them without a commercial interest deep in the interior of the Amazon basin."
683,The Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542) had been intended to protect the interests of indigenous people.
684,"The Portuguese-Brazilian slavers, the Bandeirantes, had the advantage of access from the mouth of the Amazon River, which was on the Portuguese side of the line of Tordesillas."
685,"By the 18th century, much of the Spanish territory was under de facto control of Portuguese-Brazil."
686,This reality was recognized with the legal transfer of sovereignty in 1750 of most of the Amazon basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the Treaty of Madrid.
687,This settlement sowed the seeds of the Guaraní War in 1756.
688,The French had established an empire in northern North America and took some islands in the Caribbean.
689,The English established colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America and in northern North America and some Caribbean islands as well.
690,"In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown realized that its territorial claims needed to be defended, particularly in the wake of its visible weakness during the Seven Years' War when Britain captured the important Spanish ports of Havana and Manila."
691,"Another important factor was that the Russian empire had expanded into North America from the mid-eighteenth century, with fur trading settlements in what is now Alaska and forts as far south as Fort Ross, California."
692,Great Britain was also expanding into areas that Spain claimed as its territory on the Pacific coast.
693,"Taking steps to shore up its fragile claims to California, Spain began planning California missions in 1769."
694,"Spain also began a series of voyages to the Pacific Northwest, where Russia and Great Britain were encroaching on claimed territory."
695,"The Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest, with Alessandro Malaspina and others sailing for Spain, came too late for Spain to assert its sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest."
697,"It was a dispute over claims in the Pacific Northwest, where neither nation had established permanent settlements."

699,"In 1806 Baron Nikolai Rezanov attempted to negotiate a treaty between the Russian-American Company and the Viceroyalty of New Spain, but his unexpected death in 1807 ended any treaty hopes."
700,"When the negotiations between the two nations were taking place, Spain's resources were stretched due to the Spanish American wars of independence."
701,Alessandro Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser confederation to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the élites of the empire's periphery and center was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control.
702,All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe at the turn of the 19th century with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
703,"The first major territory Spain was to lose in the 19th century was the vast Louisiana Territory, which had few European settlers."
704,It stretched north to Canada and was ceded by France in 1763 under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
705,"The French, under Napoleon, took back possession as part of the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800 and sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803."
706,"Napoleon's sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 caused border disputes between the United States and Spain that, with rebellions in West Florida (1810) and in the remainder of Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi, led to their eventual cession to the United States."
707,"The Royal Navy's decisive defeat of the main Spanish fleet, under French command, at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 undermined Spain's ability to defend and hold on to its empire."

726,"On 23 March, a large French force entered the capital Madrid."

743,"A military coup in 1820 led by Rafael del Riego forced Ferdinand to accept the constitution again, which went back into force until Ferdinand raised troops in 1823, and re-asserted absolutist rule again."
744,The reinstatement of the constitution was a major factor in propelling New Spain's elites to support independence in 1821.
745,"Historian Brian Hamnett argues that had the Spanish monarchy and Spanish liberals been more flexible regarding the place of the overseas components, that the empire would not have collapsed."
746,Juntas emerged in Spanish America as Spain faced a political crisis due to the invasion and occupation by Napoleon Bonaparte and abdication of Ferdinand VII.
747,"Spanish Americans reacted in much the same way the Peninsular Spanish did, legitimizing their actions through traditional law, which held that sovereignty reverted to the people in the absence of a legitimate king."

775,"Thus by the end of 1864, it could be said the Spanish were winning."
776,"However, military victory was trumped by political defeat."
777,"The price of war in terms of money and lives had been huge, disease and the hardy guerrilla fighters of the island causing many casualties that Spain could ill afford, and in 1865, the Bourbon Queen Isabella II signed a decree annulling the annexation."

779,"On 2 June 1899, the second expeditionary battalion Cazadores of Philippines, the last Spanish garrison in the Philippines, which had been besieged in Baler, Aurora at war's end, was pulled out, effectively ending around 300 years of Spanish hegemony in the archipelago."

798,During the Second World War the Vichy French presence in Tangier was overcome by that of Francoist Spain.
799,Spain lacked the wealth and the interest to develop an extensive economic infrastructure in its African colonies during the first half of the 20th century.

819,"An important cultural legacy of the Spanish empire overseas is Roman Catholicism, which remains the main religious faith in Spanish America and the Philippines."
820,Christian evangelization of indigenous peoples was a key responsibility of the crown and a justification for its imperial expansion.
821,"Although indigenous were considered neophytes and insufficiently mature in their faith for indigenous men to be ordained to the priesthood, the indigenous were part of the Catholic community of faith."

828,It is often argued that the rise of caudillismo during and after Latin American independence movements created a legacy of authoritarianism in the region.
829,"There was no significant development of representative institutions during the colonial era, and the executive power was often made stronger than the legislative power during the national period as a result."
830,"Unfortunately, this has led to a popular misconception that the colonial legacy has caused the region to have an extremely oppressed proletariat."
831,Revolts and riots are often seen as evidence of this supposed extreme oppression.
832,"However, the culture of revolting against an unpopular government is not simply a confirmation of widespread authoritarianism."
833,"The colonial legacy did leave a political culture of revolt, but not always as a desperate last act."
834,The civil unrest of the region is seen by some as a form of political involvement.
835,"While the political context of the political revolutions in Spanish America is understood to be one in which liberal elites competed to form new national political structures, so too were those elites responding to mass lower-class political mobilization and participation."
836,"Hundreds of towns and cities in the Americas were founded during the Spanish rule, with the colonial centers and buildings of many of them now designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites attracting tourists."
