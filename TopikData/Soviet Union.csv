0,"The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a federal socialist state in Northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991."
1,"Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics, it was a one-party state prior to 1990 governed by the Communist Party, with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian SFSR."
2,"Other major urban centers were Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR) and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR)."
3,"It was the largest country in the world by surface area, spanning over 10,000 kilometers (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500 mi) north to south."
4,"Its territory included much of Eastern Europe, parts of Northern Europe and Western Asia, and all of Central and North Asia."
5,"Its five biomes were tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains."
6,Its diverse population was officially known as the Soviet people.
7,"The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917 when the Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government that had earlier replaced the monarchy of the Russian Empire."
8,"They established the Russian Soviet Republic, beginning a civil war between the Bolshevik Red Army and many anti-Bolshevik forces across the former Empire, among whom the largest faction was the White Guard, which engaged in violent anti-communist repression against the Bolsheviks and their worker and peasant supporters known as the White Terror."
9,"The Red Army expanded and helped local Bolsheviks take power, establishing soviets, repressing their political opponents and rebellious peasants through Red Terror."
11,"The New Economic Policy (NEP), which was introduced by Lenin, led to a partial return of a free market and private property; this resulted in a period of economic recovery."
12,"Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power."
13,Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule inside the Communist Party and inaugurated a command economy.
14,"As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization, which led to significant economic growth, but also led to a man-made famine in 1932–1933 and expanded the Gulag labour camp system originally established in 1918."
15,"Stalin also fomented political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove his actual and perceived opponents from the Party through mass arrests of military leaders, Communist Party members, and ordinary citizens alike, who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death."
16,"On 23 August 1939, after unsuccessful efforts to form an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers, the Soviets signed the non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany."
17,"After the start of World War II, the formally neutral Soviets invaded and annexed territories of several Eastern European states, including eastern Poland and the Baltic states."
18,"In June 1941 the Germans invaded, opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history."
19,Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad.
20,Soviet forces eventually captured Berlin and won World War II in Europe on 9 May 1945.
21,The territory overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Eastern Bloc.
22,"The Cold War emerged in 1947 as a result of a post-war Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe, where the Eastern Bloc confronted the Western Bloc that united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949."
23,"Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period known as de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev."
24,"The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities."
25,The USSR took an early lead in the Space Race with the first ever satellite and the first human spaceflight.
26,"In the 1970s, there was a brief détente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the Soviet Union deployed troops in Afghanistan in 1979."
27,The war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation of American military aid to Mujahideen fighters.
28,"In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to further reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika."
29,The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing economic stagnation.
30,"The Cold War ended during his tenure and in 1989, Warsaw Pact countries in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective Marxist-Leninist regimes."
31,"In particular, the indecisive action of the Eastern European rulers after the Pan-European Picnic caused the fall of the Iron Curtain, which shattered the formerly powerful communist unity."
32,This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well.
33,"Central authorities initiated a referendum—boycotted by the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the Union as a renewed federation."
35,"It failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of the Communist Party."
37,The Russian Federation (formerly the Russian SFSR) assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as its continued legal personality.
39,The country had the world's second-largest economy and the largest standing military in the world.
40,The USSR was recognized as one of the five nuclear weapons states.
41,"It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as well as a member of the OSCE, the WFTU and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the Warsaw Pact."
48,It is written in Cyrillic letters.
49,The Soviets used the Cyrillic abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning.
50,"Notably, both Cyrillic letters used have homoglyphic (but transliterally distinct) letters in Latin alphabets."
51,"Because of widespread familiarity with the Cyrillic abbreviation, Latin alphabet users in particular almost always use the Latin homoglyphs C and P (as opposed to the transliteral Latin letters S and R) when rendering the USSR's native abbreviation."
53,"In the English language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR."
54,"In other European languages, the locally translated short forms and abbreviations are usually used such as Union soviétique and URSS in French, or Sowjetunion and UdSSR in German."
55,"In the English-speaking world, the Soviet Union was also informally called Russia and its citizens Russians, although that was technically incorrect since Russia was only one of the republics."
56,Such misapplications of the linguistic equivalents to the term Russia and its derivatives were frequent in other languages as well.
57,"Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America."
58,"Two other successor states, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, rank among the top 10 countries by land area, and the largest country entirely in Europe, respectively."
59,The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area and was the cultural and economic center.
60,"The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous."

69,"Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries."
70,"A parliament—the State Duma—was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to a constitutional monarchy."
71,Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities.
72,"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of Nicholas II and the imperial government in March 1917."
73,"The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I."
74,"At the same time, workers' councils, known in Russian as ""Soviets"", sprang up across the country."
75,"The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets."
76,"On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets."

78,"In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed."
79,"In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
80,"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory."

83,"Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established republics of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania."
84,"On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
85,"These two documents were confirmed by the first Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922."
86,The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.
87,"An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917."
88,"A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin."
89,"One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country."
90,The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.
91,"After the economic policy of ""War communism"" during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s, and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax."
92,"From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."
93,"The stated purpose was to prevent the return of capitalist exploitation, and that the principles of democratic centralism would be the most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner."
94,The debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.
95,"Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a ""troika"" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR."
97,"The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union."
98,"Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term ""Soviet Russia"" – strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic – was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians."
99,"Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, which gave Stalin considerable power."
100,"By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmanoeuvring his rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the country and, by the end of the 1920s, established a totalitarian rule."
101,"In October 1927, Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile."
102,"In 1928, Stalin introduced the first five-year plan for building a socialist economy."
103,"In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country."
104,"In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization."
105,"In agriculture, rather than adhering to the ""lead by example"" policy advocated by Lenin, forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country."
106,"Famines ensued as a result, causing deaths estimated at three to seven million; surviving kulaks were persecuted, and many were sent to Gulags to do forced labor."
112,"After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany."
113,"In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new constitution that was praised by supporters around the world as the most democratic constitution imaginable, though there was some skepticism."
114,"Stalin's Great Purge resulted in the detainment or execution of many ""Old Bolsheviks"" who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin."
115,"According to declassified Soviet archives, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people in 1937 and 1938, of whom 681,692 were shot."
116,"Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks."
117,The two countries concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.
118,"The former made possible the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland, while the Soviets remained formally neutral."
119,"In late November, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland."
120,"In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939."
121,"However, in April 1941, the USSR signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact with Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state."
122,The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow.
123,"The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war."
124,"After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945."
125,The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.
126,"In the same year, the USSR, in fulfilment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945."
127,"This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II."
129,"During the war, the country together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four Allied powers, and later became the Four Policemen that formed the basis of the United Nations Security Council."
130,It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period.
131,"Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the USSR had official relations with practically every country by the late 1940s."
132,"A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the country became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions."
133,"It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except Yugoslavia and later Albania), turning them into satellite states."
134,"The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955, and an economic organization, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon, a counterpart to the European Economic Community (EEC), from 1949 to 1991."
135,"The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises."
136,It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the country.
137,"Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin."
138,"Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China, and its influence grew elsewhere in the world."
139,"Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies."
140,"In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly in proxy wars."
141,"Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by Georgy Malenkov."
142,"This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s."
143,"In 1956, he denounced Joseph Stalin and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society."
145,"Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941."
146,"For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership."
147,"As a result, Soviet military forces were used to suppress an anti-communist uprising in Hungary in 1956."
148,"In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism, led to the Sino–Soviet split."
149,"This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist–Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China."
150,"This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth."
151,Censorship was relaxed as well.
152,"Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive."
153,"In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba."
154,"An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis."
155,"This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964."
156,"In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms."
157,"In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion and previous military interventions as well as any potential military interventions in the future by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which proclaimed any threat to socialist rule in a Warsaw Pact state as a threat to all Warsaw Pact states, therefore justifying military intervention."
158,"Brezhnev presided throughout détente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might."
159,"In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted."
160,The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.
161,"The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of ""standstill"", with an ageing and ossified top political leadership."
162,"This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko."
163,"In late 1979, the Soviet Union's military intervened in the ongoing civil war in neighboring Afghanistan, effectively ending a détente with the West."
164,"Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long."
165,Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.
166,"In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev."
167,"He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika."
168,His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.
169,Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War.
171,"In the following year, Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states, which paved the way for the Revolutions of 1989."
172,"In particular, the standstill of the Soviet Union at the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed."
173,"On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum."
174,Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.
175,"Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the ""War of Laws""."
177,Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman.
178,"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws."
180,"A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union."
181,The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost.
182,"In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics."
183,"The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup—an attempted coup d'état by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics."
184,"After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended."
185,The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics.
186,"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example)."
187,"Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended—effectively ending its rule."
188,"By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991."
189,"However, by December all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence."
190,"During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin."
191,"The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence."
192,Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.
193,"On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place."
194,"While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords."
195,"On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct."
196,He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.
197,"That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place."
198,"The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body, voted both itself and the country out of existence."
199,"This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state, and the end of the Cold War."
200,The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.
201,The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.
202,"Following the dissolution, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage."
203,"To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own."
204,"Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics."
205,"Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations."
206,"Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine."
207,"Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR."
208,"The dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in post-Soviet states, including a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, infant mortality and domestic violence, as well as demographic losses and income inequality and the rise of an oligarchical class, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income."
209,"Between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, the Gini ratio increased by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries."
210,The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality.
211,"Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994."
212,"Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades after World War II through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries, and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry."
213,The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.
214,"It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council."
215,"Of the two other co-founding states of the USSR at the time of the dissolution, Ukraine was the only one that had passed laws, similar to Russia, that it is a state-successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the USSR."
216,"Although it had a tough position at the time, due to Russia's position as a ""single continuation of the USSR"" that became widely accepted in the West as well as a constant pressure from the Western countries, allowed Russia to dispose state property of USSR abroad and conceal information about it."
217,"Due to that Ukraine never ratified ""zero option"" agreement that Russian Federation had signed with other former Soviet republics, as it denied disclosing of information about Soviet Gold Reserves and its Diamond Fund."
219,"We can continue to poke Kiev handouts in the calculation of ""solve the problem"", only it won't be solved."
220,"Going to a trial is also pointless: for a number of European countries this is a political issue, and they will make a decision clearly in whose favor."
221,What to do in this situation is an open question.
222,Search for non-trivial solutions.
223,"But we must remember that in 2014, with the filing of the then Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, litigation with Russia resumed in 32 countries."
224,Similar situation occurred with restitution of cultural property.
225,The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition.
226,"Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or by the party's highest body the Politburo."
227,Operations were handled by the separate Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
228,"It was known as the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (or Narkomindel), until 1946."
230,Intellectuals were based in the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.
232,"The Comintern intended to ""struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state""."
233,It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States.
235,"Moscow was concerned about the Marshall Plan, and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia."
237,"The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon, the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe."
238,The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO.
240,Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist-Leninist parties under Soviet direction.
241,Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the Marshall Plan.
243,It expelled Yugoslavia in 1948 after Josip Broz Tito insisted on an independent program.
244,"Its newspaper, For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!, promoted Stalin's positions."
245,The Cominform's concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy.
246,"By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues."
247,The Comintern was the weapon of choice.
248,"A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed (the longest lasting one was in Hungary)—the Hungarian Soviet Republic—lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919."
249,The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help.
250,"By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon."
251,"It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead."
252,"Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany."
253,The two came to terms in 1922 with the Treaty of Rapallo that settled long-standing grievances.
254,"The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of Winston Churchill and a few others about a continuing Marxist-Leninist threat, and opened trade relations and de facto diplomatic recognition in 1922."
255,"There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war Tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed."
256,Formal recognition came when the new Labour Party came to power in 1924.
257,All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations.
258,"Henry Ford opened large-scale business relations with the Soviets in the late 1920s, hoping that it would lead to long-term peace."
259,"Adolf Hitler proposed a better deal, which would give the USSR control over much of Eastern Europe through the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact."
260,"In September, Germany invaded Poland, and the USSR also invaded later that month, resulting in the partition of Poland."
261,"In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II."
262,"In turn, the Central Committee voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952 and 1966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the Soviet Union."
263,"Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941)."
264,All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU.
266,"Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state."
267,"Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned."
268,"However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees."
269,It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the government budget.
270,"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium (successor of the Central Executive Committee) to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society."
271,"State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990."
272,"Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees, local Soviets and executive committees."
273,"It was instrumental in the Great Purge, but was brought under strict party control after Stalin's death."
274,"Under Yuri Andropov, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s."
275,"No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government."
276,"The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed."
277,"Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Stalin, as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal, itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee."
278,"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989."
279,"The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, and much stronger than before."
280,"For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers."
282,"The coup failed, and the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power ""in the period of transition""."
283,"Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR."
284,The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts (People's Court) and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet.
285,The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts.
286,"The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law, where the judge, procurator, and defence attorney collaborate to establish the truth."
289,"With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status."
290,"In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of Ukraine and Bessarabia and northern Bukovina."
291,"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation."
292,Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.
293,"The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence, the country was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as ""Russia""."
294,"While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and area), most powerful, most developed, and the industrial center of the Soviet Union."
295,"Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was ""window dressing"" for Russian dominance."
296,"For that reason, the people of the USSR were usually called ""Russians"", not ""Soviets"", since ""everyone knew who really ran the show""."
297,"The OGPU later became independent and in 1934 joined the NKVD, and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats."
298,"After World War II, Strategic Missile Forces (1959), Air Defense Forces (1948) and National Civil Defense Forces (1970) were formed, which ranked first, third, and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance (ground forces were second, Air Force Fourth, and Navy Fifth)."
299,The army had the greatest political influence.
300,"In 1989, there served two million soldiers divided between 150 motorized and 52 armored divisions."
301,"Until the early 1960s, the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch, but after the Caribbean crisis, under the leadership of Sergei Gorshkov, it expanded significantly."
302,It became known for battlecruisers and submarines.
304,The Soviet Air Force focused on a fleet of strategic bombers and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity.
305,The air force also had a number of fighters and tactical bombers to support the army in the war.
306,"Strategic missile forces had more than 1,400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed between 28 bases and 300 command centers."
307,"In the post-war period, the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad."
308,"These included the suppression of the uprising in East Germany (1953), Hungarian revolution (1956) and the invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968)."
309,The Soviet Union also participated in the war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989.
310,"In the Soviet Union, general conscription applied."
311,This was followed by other successful satellites and experimental dogs were sent.
313,He once flew around the Earth and successfully landed in the Kazakh steppe.
314,"At that time, the first plans for space shuttles and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices, but in the end personal disputes between designers and management prevented this."
315,"The first big fiasco for the USSR was the landing on the moon by the Americans, when the Russians were not able to respond to the Americans in time with the same project."
316,"In the 1970s, more specific proposals for the design of the space shuttle began to emerge, but shortcomings, especially in the electronics industry (rapid overheating of electronics), postponed the program until the end of the 1980s."
317,"The first shuttle, the Buran, flew in 1988, but without a human crew."
318,"Another shuttle, Ptichka, eventually ended up under construction, as the shuttle project was canceled in 1991."
319,"For their launch into space, there is today an unused superpower rocket, Energia, which is the most powerful in the world."
320,"In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union managed to build the Mir orbital station."
321,It was built on the construction of Salyut stations and its tasks were purely civilian and research.
322,"In the 1990s, when the US Skylab was shut down due to lack of funds, it was the only orbital station in operation."
323,"Gradually, other modules were added to it, including American ones."
324,"However, the technical condition of the station deteriorated rapidly, especially after the fire, so in 2001 it was decided to bring it into the atmosphere where it burned down."
325,"The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and free trade."
326,"After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses."
327,"Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s."
328,"The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world."
329,"As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II."
330,"The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction."
331,"By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally."
332,"After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly."
333,"However, the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade."
334,Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.
335,"During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry."
336,"At the same time, the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the Third World."
337,Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.
338,"From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged."
339,"The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans."
340,"However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors."
341,All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership.
342,Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods.
343,"Credit was discouraged, but widespread."
344,"The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting."
345,"In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over consumer goods."
346,"Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety."
347,"Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices."
348,"A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not."
349,The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.
350,"Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s."
351,"During the 1950s and 1960s, it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West."
352,"However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries, despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan)."
353,"Overall, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1989 was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries)."
354,"According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster."
355,"By their calculation, per capita income in 1989 should have been twice higher than it was, considering the amount of investment, education and population."
356,The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital.
357,Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living declined due to Stalin's despotism.
358,"His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives, resulting in a sharp decline in output."
359,"The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse."
360,"Prices were still fixed, and the property was still largely state-owned until after the country's dissolution."
361,"For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP (PPP) was the second-largest in the world, and third during the second half of the 1980s, although on a per-capita basis, it was behind that of First World countries."
362,"It was the third-highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and the 25th in the world of 130 countries."
363,"At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975."
364,"David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40% of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century."
365,His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.
366,"Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported."
367,"In the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency."
368,"At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second-largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia."
369,Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding.
370,"Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations."
373,"Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World."
374,"Under the Reagan administration, Project Socrates determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using."
375,"In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors."
376,"In contrast, the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage."
377,"However, technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility."
378,This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.
379,"The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot, an aviation enterprise."
380,"The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air."
382,"The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities."
383,Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had.
384,"By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones."
385,"Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction."
386,Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.
387,The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world.
388,The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.
389,"In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post–World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanistion and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics."
390,"An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again."
391,"Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services."
392,"The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years."
393,"Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed, and researchers could delve into the real causes."
394,"Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies."
395,"Beginning in October 1918,  Lenin's government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality (re-criminalized in the 1930s), permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms."
396,"However, without birth control, the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children."
397,The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy.
398,"Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country's military power."
399,"After heavy casualties in World War I and II, women outnumbered men in Russia by a 4:3 ratio."
400,This contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time.
401,"In the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy."
402,All left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system.
403,Literate people were automatically hired as teachers.
404,"For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity."
407,"In the aftermath of World War II, the country's educational system expanded dramatically, which had a tremendous effect."
409,"Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society."
410,Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man.
411,Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training.
412,"The education system was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness."
413,"However, as part of the general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations."
414,The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary.
415,"According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US."
417,The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.
418,"If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father."
419,"Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians."
420,"Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force."
421,"Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not."
422,"During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there."
423,"According to the last census in 1989, the Russian ""diaspora"" in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million."
424,"As Lenin later noted, ""Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice""."
425,The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.
426,"Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time."
428,"Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists."
429,"This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision."
430,This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system.
431,These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States.
432,"Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of alcohol abuse."
433,"At the same time, infant mortality began to rise."
434,"After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter."
435,This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.
436,"The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected."
437,"During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies."
438,A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other.
439,"When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain ""official language"" status."
440,"There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore, their speakers were forced to have a second language."
441,"There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread."
442,"These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian."
443,"Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the largest Christian denomination."
444,"About 90% of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias being concentrated in the Azerbaijan SSR."
445,The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.
446,"Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately."""
447,"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929 included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study."
448,Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s.
449,"The government targeted religions based on state interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools."
450,"In 1925, the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the propaganda campaign."
451,"Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious."
452,"While persecution accelerated following Stalin's rise to power, a revival of Orthodoxy was fostered by the government during World War II and the Soviet authorities sought to control the Russian Orthodox Church rather than liquidate it."
453,"During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests."
454,Many others were imprisoned or exiled.
455,Believers were harassed and persecuted.
456,"Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited."
457,"By 1941, only 500 churches remained open out of about 54,000 in existence before World War I."
458,"Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s."
459,Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II.
460,"Amid other accommodations to religious faith after the German invasion, churches were reopened."
461,"Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943."
462,Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the USSR even through the late 1980s.
463,"During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97."
464,Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.
465,"A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20% of the Soviet population as ""active religious believers."""
466,"The socio-economic nature of communist states such as the USSR, especially under Stalin, has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of bureaucratic collectivism, state capitalism, state socialism, or a totally unique mode of production."
467,"The USSR implemented a broad range of policies over a long period of time, with a large amount of conflicting policies being implemented by different leaders."
468,"Some have a positive view of it whilst others are critical towards the country, calling it a repressive oligarchy."
469,"The opinions on the USSR are complex and have changed over time, with different generations having different views on the matter as well as on Soviet policies corresponding to separate time periods during its history."
470,Leftists have largely varying views on the USSR.
471,"Whilst some leftists such as anarchists and other libertarian socialists, agree it did not give the workers control over the means of production and was a centralized oligarchy, others have more positive opinions as to the Bolshevik policies and Vladimir Lenin."
472,Many anti-Stalinist leftists such as anarchists are extremely critical of Soviet authoritarianism and repression.
473,"Much of the criticism it receives is centered around massacres in the Soviet Union, the centralized hierarchy present in the USSR and mass political repression as well as violence towards government critics and political dissidents such as other leftists."
474,Critics also point towards its failure to implement any substantial worker cooperatives or implementing worker liberation as well as corruption and the Soviet authoritarian nature.
475,"Many Russians and other former Soviet citizens have nostalgia for the USSR, pointing towards most infrastructure being built during Soviet times, increased job security, increased literacy rate, increased caloric intake and supposed ethnic pluralism enacted in the Soviet Union as well as political stability."
476,"The Russian Revolution is also seen in a positive light as well as the leadership of Lenin, Nikita Khrushchev and the later USSR, although many view Joseph Stalin's rule as positive for the country."
477,"In Armenia, 12% of respondents said the USSR collapse did good, while 66% said it did harm."
478,"In Kyrgyzstan, 16% of respondents said the collapse of the USSR did good, while 61% said it did harm."
479,"In a 2018 Rating Sociological Group poll, 47% of Ukrainian respondents had a positive opinion of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982."
480,"The war became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts."
481,"As a result of the massive losses suffered by the military and civilians during the conflict, Victory Day celebrated on 9 May is still one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia."
482,"In large part due to the Holodomor, ethnic Ukrainians have a negative view of it."
483,Russian-speaking Ukrainians of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions have a more positive view of the USSR.
484,"In some countries with internal conflict, there is also nostalgia for the USSR, especially for refugees of the post-Soviet conflicts who have been forced to flee their homes and have been displaced."
485,This nostalgia is less an admiration for the country or its policies than it is a longing to return to their homes and not to live in poverty.
486,The many Russian enclaves in the former USSR republics such as Transnistria have in a general a positive remembrance of it.
487,"Anarchists are critical of the country, labeling the Soviet system as red fascism."
488,"Soviets actively destroyed anarchist organizations and anarchist communities, labeling anarchists as ""enemies of the people""."
489,"The Soviet invasion of the anarchist Free Territory and suppression of the anarchist Kronstadt rebellion and the Norilsk uprising, in which prisoners created a radical system of government based on cooperatives and direct democracy in the Gulag, led to animosity and hatred towards the USSR."
490,Anarchist organizations and unions were also banned during the Spanish Civil War under the Republican government by orders from the Soviet government.
491,"Due to this, anarchists generally hold a large animosity towards the USSR."
492,"During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art."
493,Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people.
494,"In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated."
495,Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time.
496,"As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director Sergei Eisenstein's best work dates from this period."
497,"During Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as Mikhail Bulgakov's works."
498,"During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life."
499,"Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work."
500,"The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism."
501,"Underground dissident literature, known as samizdat, developed during this late period."
