0,"A nuclear weapon (also called an atom bomb, nuke, atomic bomb, nuclear warhead, A-bomb, or nuclear bomb) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb)."
1,Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter.
2,"The first test of a fission (""atomic"") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ)."
3,"The first thermonuclear (""hydrogen"") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT (42 PJ)."
5,"A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation."
6,"Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy."
7,"These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel."
8,The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are subjects of debate.
9,"Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been detonated over 2,000 times for testing and demonstration."
10,Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them.
11,"The only countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and acknowledge possessing them—are (chronologically by date of first test) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea."
12,"Israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though, in a policy of deliberate ambiguity, it does not acknowledge having them."
13,"Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states."
14,Modernisation of weapons continues to this day.
15,Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs (abbreviated as A-bombs).
16,"This has long been noted as something of a misnomer, as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom, just as it does with fusion weapons."
17,"In fission weapons, a mass of fissile material (enriched uranium or plutonium) is forced into supercriticality—allowing an exponential growth of nuclear chain reactions—either by shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another (the ""gun"" method) or by compression of a sub-critical sphere or cylinder of fissile material using chemically-fueled explosive lenses."
18,"The latter approach, the ""implosion"" method, is more sophisticated than the former."
19,A major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is to ensure that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself.
20,"Many fission products are either highly radioactive (but short-lived) or moderately radioactive (but long-lived), and as such, they are a serious form of radioactive contamination."
21,Fission products are the principal radioactive component of nuclear fallout.
22,Another source of radioactivity is the burst of free neutrons produced by the weapon.
23,"When they collide with other nuclei in surrounding material, the neutrons transmute those nuclei into other isotopes, altering their stability and making them radioactive."
24,The most commonly used fissile materials for nuclear weapons applications have been uranium-235 and plutonium-239.
25,Less commonly used has been uranium-233.
26,"Neptunium-237 and some isotopes of americium may be usable for nuclear explosives as well, but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented, and their plausible use in nuclear weapons is a matter of dispute."
27,"Such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs (abbreviated as H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium)."
28,"Whether India has detonated a ""true"" multi-staged thermonuclear weapon is controversial."
29,"North Korea claims to have tested a fusion weapon as of January 2016, though this claim is disputed."
30,Thermonuclear weapons are considered much more difficult to successfully design and execute than primitive fission weapons.
31,"In the Teller-Ulam design, which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs, this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel (tritium, deuterium, or lithium deuteride) in proximity within a special, radiation-reflecting container."
32,"When the fission bomb is detonated, gamma rays and X-rays emitted first compress the fusion fuel, then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures."
33,"The ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed neutrons, which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it, such as depleted uranium."
34,"Each of these components is known as a ""stage"", with the fission bomb as the ""primary"" and the fusion capsule as the ""secondary""."
35,"This technique can be used to construct thermonuclear weapons of arbitrarily large yield, in contrast to fission bombs, which are limited in their explosive force."
36,"The largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba of the USSR, which released an energy equivalent of over 50 megatons of TNT (210 PJ), was a three-stage weapon."
37,"Most thermonuclear weapons are considerably smaller than this, due to practical constraints from missile warhead space and weight requirements."
38,"Fusion reactions do not create fission products, and thus contribute far less to the creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions, but because all thermonuclear weapons contain at least one fission stage, and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage, thermonuclear weapons can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons."
39,"For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small number of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb."
40,"In the boosted bomb, the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb."
41,"There are two types of boosted fission bomb: internally boosted, in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core, and externally boosted, in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core."
42,Some nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes; a neutron bomb is a thermonuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of neutron radiation; such a device could theoretically be used to cause massive casualties while leaving infrastructure mostly intact and creating a minimal amount of fallout.
43,The detonation of any nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of neutron radiation.
44,Surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials (such as cobalt or gold) creates a weapon known as a salted bomb.
45,This device can produce exceptionally large quantities of long-lived radioactive contamination.
46,"It has been conjectured that such a device could serve as a ""doomsday weapon"" because such a large quantity of radioactivities with half-lives of decades, lifted into the stratosphere where winds would distribute it around the globe, would make all life on the planet extinct."
47,"In connection with the Strategic Defense Initiative, research into the nuclear pumped laser was conducted under the DOD program Project Excalibur but this did not result in a working weapon."
48,The concept involves the tapping of the energy of an exploding nuclear bomb to power a single-shot laser which is directed at a distant target.
49,"During the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test in 1962, an unexpected effect was produced which is called a nuclear electromagnetic pulse."
50,This is an intense flash of electromagnetic energy produced by a rain of high energy electrons which in turn are produced by a nuclear bomb's gamma rays.
51,This flash of energy can permanently destroy or disrupt electronic equipment if insufficiently shielded.
52,It has been proposed to use this effect to disable an enemy's military and civilian infrastructure as an adjunct to other nuclear or conventional military operations against that enemy.
53,"Because the effect is produced by high altitude nuclear detonations, it can produce damage to electronics over a wide, even continental, geographical area."
54,Research has been done into the possibility of pure fusion bombs: nuclear weapons that consist of fusion reactions without requiring a fission bomb to initiate them.
55,"Such a device might provide a simpler path to thermonuclear weapons than one that required development of fission weapons first, and pure fusion weapons would create significantly less nuclear fallout than other thermonuclear weapons, because they would not disperse fission products."
56,"A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it is feasible beyond the military domain."
57,This method places few restrictions on the size of the weapon.
58,"It does, however, limit attack range, response time to an impending attack, and the number of weapons that a country can field at the same time."
59,"With miniaturization, nuclear bombs can be delivered by both strategic bombers and tactical fighter-bombers."
60,"Preferable from a strategic point of view is a nuclear weapon mounted on a missile, which can use a ballistic trajectory to deliver the warhead over the horizon."
61,"Although even short-range missiles allow for a faster and less vulnerable attack, the development of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) has given some nations the ability to plausibly deliver missiles anywhere on the globe with a high likelihood of success."
62,"More advanced systems, such as multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), can launch multiple warheads at different targets from one missile, reducing the chance of a successful missile defense."
63,"Today, missiles are most common among systems designed for delivery of nuclear weapons."
64,An atomic mortar has been tested by the United States.
65,"Small, two-man portable tactical weapons (somewhat misleadingly referred to as suitcase bombs), such as the Special Atomic Demolition Munition, have been developed, although the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility."
66,The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence.
67,The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate).
68,"During the Cold War, policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack, and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions."
69,Different forms of nuclear weapons delivery (see above) allow for different types of nuclear strategies.
70,The goals of any strategy are generally to make it difficult for an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict.
71,"This can mean keeping weapon locations hidden, such as deploying them on submarines or land mobile transporter erector launchers whose locations are difficult to track, or it can mean protecting weapons by burying them in hardened missile silo bunkers."
72,"Other components of nuclear strategies included using missile defenses to destroy the missiles before they land, or implementing civil defense measures using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack."
73,Weapons designed to threaten large populations or to deter attacks are known as strategic weapons.
74,Nuclear weapons for use on a battlefield in military situations are called tactical weapons.
75,Critics of nuclear war strategy often suggest that a nuclear war between two nations would result in mutual annihilation.
76,"From this point of view, the significance of nuclear weapons is to deter war because any nuclear war would escalate out of mutual distrust and fear, resulting in mutually assured destruction."
77,"This threat of national, if not global, destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism."
78,Critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate.
79,"According to an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in 1996, the use of (or threat of use of) such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, but the court did not reach an opinion as to whether or not the threat or use would be lawful in specific extreme circumstances such as if the survival of the state were at stake."
80,Another deterrence position is that nuclear proliferation can be desirable.
81,"Some prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, have argued, along the lines of Gallois, that some forms of nuclear proliferation would decrease the likelihood of total war, especially in troubled regions of the world where there exists a single nuclear-weapon state."
82,"Aside from the public opinion that opposes proliferation in any form, there are two schools of thought on the matter: those, like Mearsheimer, who favored selective proliferation, and Waltz, who was somewhat more non-interventionist."
83,The prospect of mutually assured destruction might not deter an enemy who expects to die in the confrontation.
84,"Further, if the initial act is from a stateless terrorist instead of a sovereign nation, there might not be a nation or specific target to retaliate against."
85,"It has been argued, especially after the September 11, 2001, attacks, that this complication calls for a new nuclear strategy, one that is distinct from that which gave relative stability during the Cold War."
86,"By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent."
88,"By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin."""
89,The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints.
92,"In most countries, the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state."
93,"The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955, by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War."
94,It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict.
95,"The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955."
96,"This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957."
97,"By the 1960s, steps were taken to limit both the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries and the environmental effects of nuclear testing."
98,"The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963) restricted all nuclear testing to underground nuclear testing, to prevent contamination from nuclear fallout, whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) attempted to place restrictions on the types of activities signatories could participate in, with the goal of allowing the transference of non-military nuclear technology to member countries without fear of proliferation."
99,"In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established under the mandate of the United Nations to encourage development of peaceful applications of nuclear technology, provide international safeguards against its misuse, and facilitate the application of safety measures in its use."
100,"In 1996, many nations signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits all testing of nuclear weapons."
101,A testing ban imposes a significant hindrance to nuclear arms development by any complying country.
103,"Even when they did not enter into force, these agreements helped limit and later reduce the numbers and types of nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia."
104,Nuclear weapons have also been opposed by agreements between countries.
105,"Many nations have been declared Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, areas where nuclear weapons production and deployment are prohibited, through the use of treaties."
106,"The Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967) prohibited any production or deployment of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Treaty of Pelindaba (1964) prohibits nuclear weapons in many African countries."
107,As recently as 2006 a Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone was established among the former Soviet republics of Central Asia prohibiting nuclear weapons.
108,"In 1996, the International Court of Justice, the highest court of the United Nations, issued an Advisory Opinion concerned with the ""Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons""."
109,"The court ruled that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would violate various articles of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, the UN Charter, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
110,"In the wake of the tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, economic sanctions were (temporarily) levied against both countries, though neither were signatories with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
111,One of the stated casus belli for the initiation of the 2003 Iraq War was an accusation by the United States that Iraq was actively pursuing nuclear arms (though this was soon discovered not to be the case as the program had been discontinued).
112,"In 1981, Israel had bombed a nuclear reactor being constructed in Osirak, Iraq, in what it called an attempt to halt Iraq's previous nuclear arms ambitions; in 2007, Israel bombed another reactor being constructed in Syria."
113,"Beginning with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty and continuing through the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles."
114,"The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must ""pursue negotiations in good faith"" towards the long-term goal of ""complete disarmament""."
115,"The former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine returned Soviet nuclear arms stationed in their countries to Russia after the collapse of the USSR."
116,"Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war, especially accidentally."
117,Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the present nuclear peace and deterrence and would lead to increased global instability.
118,"Various American elder statesmen, who were in office during the Cold War period, have been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons."
119,"These officials include Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry."
120,"In January 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev publicly proposed a three-stage program for abolishing the world's nuclear weapons by the end of the 20th century."
121,"In the years after the end of the Cold War, there have been numerous campaigns to urge the abolition of nuclear weapons, such as that organized by the Global Zero movement, and the goal of a ""world without nuclear weapons"" was advocated by United States President Barack Obama in an April 2009 speech in Prague."
122,"Kenneth Waltz has argued that nuclear weapons have helped keep an uneasy peace, and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common before their invention at the end of World War II."
123,"But former Secretary Henry Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: ""The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil."
124,"In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn’t operate in any comparable way""."
125,"It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially land mines and small arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts."
126,"The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial."
130,"After these 2 incidents, the core was used to construct a bomb for use on the Nevada Test Range."
132,This was the first such nuclear weapon loss in history.
133,"The accident was designated a ""Broken Arrow""—an accident involving a nuclear weapon but which does not present a risk of war."
134,Experts believe that up to 50 nuclear weapons were lost during the Cold War.
136,"According to a researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, it was one of the most powerful bombs made to date."
138,"January 24, 1961: the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash occurred near Goldsboro, North Carolina."
139,"A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process."
140,"1965 Philippine Sea A-4 crash, where a Skyhawk attack aircraft with a nuclear weapon fell into the sea."
141,"The pilot, the aircraft, and the B43 nuclear bomb were never recovered."
142,It was not until 1989 that the Pentagon revealed the loss of the one-megaton bomb.
147,"The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a 2½-month-long search."
148,"January 21, 1968: the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash involved a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52 bomber."
149,The aircraft was carrying four hydrogen bombs when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft.
150,"Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out."
151,"The bomber crashed onto sea ice in Greenland, causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination."
152,One of the bombs remains lost.
154,"The accident was caused by a maintenance man who dropped a socket from a socket wrench down an 80-foot (24 m) shaft, puncturing a fuel tank on the rocket."
155,"Leaking fuel resulted in a hypergolic fuel explosion, jettisoning the W-53 warhead beyond the launch site."
156,Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon.
157,"One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan."
158,"A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests would lead to perhaps 11,000 excess deaths among people alive during atmospheric testing in the United States from all forms of cancer, including leukemia, from 1951 to well into the 21st century."
161,This period has some improvement in survivors' condition.
163,"Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand millisieverts of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders."
164,Radioactive fallout became less of an issue and the anti-nuclear weapons movement went into decline for some years.
165,A resurgence of interest occurred amid European and American fears of nuclear war in the 1980s.
166,57 percent of which was spent on building nuclear weapons delivery systems.
167,"During the 1960s and 1970s, both the United States and the Soviet Union conducted a number of PNEs."
168,"Six of the explosions by the Soviet Union are considered to have been of an applied nature, not just tests."
169,The United States and the Soviet Union later halted their programs.
170,Definitions and limits are covered in the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976.
171,"The stalled Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 would prohibit all nuclear explosions, regardless of whether they are for peaceful purposes or not."
176,Missile defenses will not allow us to escape our vulnerability to nuclear weapons.
177,"Instead large-scale developments will create barriers to taking real steps toward reducing nuclear risks—by blocking further cuts in nuclear arsenals and potentially spurring new deployments."""
