0,Ancient Greek literature is literature written in the Ancient Greek language from the earliest texts until the time of the Byzantine Empire.
1,"The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era."
2,"These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, comprised the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods."
3,"The lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition."
4,Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete.
5,"Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly Oedipus the King and Antigone."
6,Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre.
7,"The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy."
8,"The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the sixth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes."
9,"The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential."
10,"Important later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote The Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays."
11,"The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Hellenized Syrian, who wrote primarily works of satire."
12,Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large.
13,"In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors."
14,"Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs."
15,"The earliest known Greek writings are Mycenaean, written in the Linear B syllabary on clay tablets."
16,These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade.
18,The first division was between prose and poetry.
19,"Within poetry there were three super-genres: epic, lyric and drama."
20,The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology.
22,Prose literature can largely be said to begin with Herodotus.
23,"Over time, several genres of prose literature developed, but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred."
24,The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery.
25,"Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time."
26,The Iliad is a narrative of a single episode spanning over the course of a ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War.
27,"It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal."
28,"The Odyssey is an account of the adventures of Odysseus, one of the warriors at Troy."
29,"After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family."
30,"Penelope was considered the ideal female, Homer depicted her as the ideal female based on her commitment, modesty, purity, and respect during her marriage with Odysseus."
31,"During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar."
32,Both of these works were based on ancient legends.
33,"The stories are told in language that is simple, and direct."
34,"The Homeric dialect was an archaic language based on Ionic dialect mixed with some element of Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect, the latter due to the Athenian edition of the 6th century BC."
35,"Unlike Homer, Hesiod refers to himself in his poetry."
36,"Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any external source."
37,"He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC."
38,Hesiod's two extant poems are Works and Days and Theogony.
39,"Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers."
40,Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods.
41,"Despite the name, however, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by cithara, but by flute."
42,These two latter genres were elegiac poetry and iambic poetry.
43,Both were written in the Ionic dialect.
44,Elegiac poems were written in elegiac couplets and iambic poems were written in iambic trimeter.
45,"The first of the lyric poets was probably Archilochus of Paros, 7th century BC, the most important iambic poet."
46,"Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets."
47,Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters.
48,"The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called ""Nine Lyric Poets""."
49,"In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer."
50,"Only one of her poems, ""Ode to Aphrodite"", has survived to the present day in its original, completed form."
51,"In addition to Sappho, her contemporary Alcaeus of Lesbos was also notable for monodic lyric poetry."
52,"The poetry written by Alcman was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the Doric dialect, which was normally considered unpleasant to hear."
53,The later poet Pindar of Thebes was renowned for his choral lyric poetry.
54,Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states.
55,"The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus."
56,The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus.
57,"In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth."
58,Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty.
59,Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship.
60,Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens.
61,"The authorship of Prometheus Bound, which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, and Rhesus, which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are, however, questioned."
62,There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus.
63,"Three of these plays, Agamemnon, The Libation-Bearers, and The Eumenides, form a trilogy known as the Oresteia."
64,"The Theban Trilogy consists of Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone."
65,"Although the plays are often called a ""trilogy,"" they were actually written many years apart."
66,"Antigone, the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles's career."
67,"Oedipus the King, the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles's career."
68,"The most well-known of these plays are Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae."
69,"Rhesus is sometimes thought to have been written by Euripides' son, or to have been a posthumous reproduction of a play by Euripides."
70,Euripides pushed the limits of the tragic genre and many of the elements in his plays were more typical of comedy than tragedy.
71,"His play Alcestis, for instance, has often been categorized as a ""problem play"" or perhaps even as a work of tragicomedy rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending."
72,"Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult."
73,"At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions."
74,"As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers."
75,The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes.
76,These are a treasure trove of comic presentation.
77,He poked fun at everyone and every institution.
81,Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry.
82,"John Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, ""the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Molière seems dull and Shakespeare clownish."""
83,"Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides."
84,"When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize."
85,"It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia."
86,"Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences."
87,"Although the genre was popular, only one complete example of a satyr play has survived: Cyclops by Euripides."
88,"Large portions of a second satyr play, Ichneutae by Sophocles, have been recovered from the site of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri."
89,"Herodotus is commonly called ""The Father of History."""
90,His book The Histories is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence.
91,"Xenophon's most famous work is his book The Anabasis, a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne."
92,"Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates: The Apology of Socrates to the Jury, The Symposium, and Memorabilia."
93,"Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different."
94,Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.
95,"Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called ""Milesian philosophers"": Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, and Anaximenes."
96,Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate.
97,"Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues."
98,"Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name."
99,The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.
100,"Plato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals."
101,"The first sentence of his Metaphysics reads: ""All men by nature desire to know."""
102,"He has, therefore, been called the ""Father of those who know."""
103,"His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as ""the Philosopher""."
104,"Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations."
105,"However, none of these exist today."
106,"The body of writings that have come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum."
107,"Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government."
108,"Among Aristotle's most notable works are Politics, Nicomachean Ethics, Poetics, On the Soul, and Rhetoric."
109,Philip's son Alexander the Great extended his father's conquests greatly.
110,"It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world."
111,"In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of Christian thought."
112,"The Musaeum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I."
113,The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library.
114,"The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek."
115,It was intended to serve as a repository for every work of classical Greek literature that could be found.
116,The Roman Virgil later wrote his Eclogues in this genre.
117,"Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, composed the Aetia (""Causes""), a long poem written in four volumes of elegiac couplets describing the legendary origins of obscure customs, festivals, and names, which he probably wrote in several stages over the course of many years in the third century BC."
118,"The Aetia was lost during the Middle Ages, but, over the course of the twentieth century, much of it was recovered due to new discoveries of ancient papyri."
119,"Scholars initially denigrated it as ""second-rate"", showing great learning, but lacking true ""art""."
120,"Over the course of the century, scholarly appraisal of it greatly improved, with many scholars now seeing it in a much more positive light."
121,"Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the Ibis, which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius."
122,"The poet Aratus wrote the hexameter poem Phaenomena, a poetic rendition of Eudoxus of Cnidus's treatise on the stars written in the fourth century BC."
123,The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright Menander.
124,"None of Menander's plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, The Bad-Tempered Man, has survived to the present day in a near-complete form."
125,Most of another play entitled The Girl from Samos and large portions of another five have also survived.
126,"His History, though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius."
127,"In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work."
128,"Timaeus also wrote the Olympionikai, a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games."
129,"Authors of ancient bios, such as the works of Nepos and Plutarch's Parallel Lives imitated many of the same sources and techniques of the contemporary historiographies of ancient Greece, notably including the works of Herodotus and Thucydides."
130,"There were various forms of ancient biographies, including 1) philosophical biographies that brought out the moral character of their subject (such as Diogenes Laertius's Lives of Eminent Philosophers 2) literary biographies which discussed the lives of orators and poets (such as Philostratus's Lives of the Sophists) 3) school and reference biographies that offered a short sketch of someone including their ancestry, major events and accomplishments, and death, 4) autobiographies, commentaries and memoirs where the subject presents his own life and 5) historical/political biography focusing on the lives of those active in the military, among other categories."
131,He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference.
132,Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and Archimedes has been preserved.
133,"Euclid is known for his Elements, much of which was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus."
134,"The Elements is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics."
135,From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present.
136,"Among them are Measurement of the Circle, in which he worked out the value of pi; The Method of Mechanical Theorems, on his work in mechanics; The Sand Reckoner; and On Floating Bodies."
137,A manuscript of his works is currently being studied.
138,The Milesiaka by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC.
139,"The Milesiaka itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived."
140,The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal the existence of a genre of ancient Greek picaresque novel.
141,"Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well."
142,"A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus."
143,"The New Testament, written by various authors in varying qualities of Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul."
144,He also wrote a poetic paraphrase of The Gospel of John.
145,Nonnus probably lived sometime during the late fourth century AD or early fifth century AD.
146,He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168.
147,In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus.
148,He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage.
149,"He wrote a universal history, Bibliotheca Historica, in 40 books."
150,"Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain."
151,The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era.
152,"The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France."
153,Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the first century BC.
154,"His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched."
155,"Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great."
156,Arrian served in the Roman army.
157,His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life.
158,"Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the Diatribai, based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus."
159,"Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119."
160,His Parallel Lives of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published.
161,"Surviving examples of this popular genre include works such as Aulus Gellius's Attic Nights, Athenaeus of Naucratis's Deipnosophistae, and Claudius Aelianus's De Natura Animalium and Varia Historia."
162,"He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years."
163,"Strabo, who died about AD 23, was a geographer and historian."
164,His Historical Sketches in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost.
165,His Geographical Sketches remain as the only existing ancient book covering the whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the time of Augustus.
166,"Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a geographer."
167,His Description of Greece is a travel guide describing the geography and mythic history of Greece during the second century.
168,"He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life."
169,"His masterpiece, originally entitled The Mathematical Collection, has come to the present under the title Almagest, as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title."
170,"It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an Earth-centered universe, a notion that dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years."
171,"The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and other early modern astronomers replaced it with heliocentrism."
172,"Unfortunately, Diogenes Laërtius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable."
173,"Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers."
174,His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved.
175,He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called Neoplatonism.
176,His Enneads had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century.
177,"Plotinus's philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of nous, psyche, and the ""One."
178,"""After the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians."
179,"The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism."
180,"Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was even able to hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise Contra Celsum."
181,The ancient Greek novels Leucippe and Clitophon by Achilles Tatius and Daphnis and Chloe by Longus were both probably written during the early second century AD.
182,"Daphnis and Chloe, by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos."
183,"The Wonders Beyond Thule by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date."
184,"The Wonders Beyond Thule has not survived in its complete form, but a very lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived."
185,The Ephesian Tale by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD.
186,The satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD.
187,Lucian's works were incredibly popular during antiquity.
188,Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day.
189,Almost all of Lucian's works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time.
190,"His book The Syrian Goddess, however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus."
191,"Lucian's most famous work is the novel A True Story, which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction."
192,"His dialogue The Lover of Lies contains several of the earliest known ghost stories as well as the earliest known version of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice."""
193,"It tells the story of a young Ethiopian princess named Chariclea, who is estranged from her family and goes on many misadventures across the known world."
194,"Of all the ancient Greek novels, the one that attained the greatest level of popularity was the Alexander Romance, a fictionalized account of the exploits of Alexander the Great written in the third century AD."
195,"Eighty versions of it have survived in twenty-four different languages, attesting that, during the Middle Ages, the novel was nearly as popular as the Bible."
196,Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature.
197,"These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics."
198,Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later Greek literature.
199,"For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work Hero and Leander, written by Musaeus Grammaticus."
200,Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works.
201,"The medieval writer Roger Bacon wrote that ""there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."""
202,It was not until the Renaissance that Greek writings were rediscovered by western European scholars.
203,"During the Renaissance, Greek began to be taught in western European colleges and universities for the first time, which resulted in western European scholars rediscovering the literature of ancient Greece."
204,"The Textus Receptus, the first New Testament printed in the original Greek, was published in 1516 by the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus."
205,"Erasmus also published Latin translations of classical Greek texts, including a Latin translation of Hesiod's Works and Days."
206,The influence of classical Greek literature on modern literature is also evident.
207,Numerous figures from classical literature and mythology appear throughout The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.
208,"Plutarch's Lives were a major influence on William Shakespeare and served as the main source behind his tragedies Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus."
209,Shakespeare's comedies A Comedy of Errors and The Twelfth Night drew heavily on themes from Graeco-Roman New Comedy.
210,"It also makes frequent allusions to figures from classical literature and mythology, using them as symbols to convey a Christian message."
211,Lucian's A True Story was part of the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels.
212,"James Joyce's novel Ulysses, heralded by critics as one of the greatest works of modern literature, is a retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in modern-day Dublin."
213,"The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics."
214,A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages.
