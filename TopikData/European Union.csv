0,The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.
1,"The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one."
2,"EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development."
3,Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.
5,"The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome."
6,"The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany."
7,The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit.
8,The United Kingdom became the first member state to leave the EU on 31 January 2020.
9,"Before this, three territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners."
10,"The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009."
11,"Additionally, all EU countries have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme."
12,"In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
13,"Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence."
14,"It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20."
15,"Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower."
16,The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification.
17,"The EU inherited many of its present responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration."
18,"This political philosophy of a supra-national rule over the continent, similar to the example of the ancient Roman Empire, resulted in the early Middle Ages in the concept of a renovatio imperii (""restoration of the empire""), either in the forms of the Reichsidee (""imperial idea"") or the religiously inspired Imperium Christianum (""christian empire"")."
19,"In the decades following the outcomes of the Congress of Vienna, ideals of European unity flourished across the continent, especially in the writings of Wojciech Jastrzębowski (1799–1882) or Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872)."
20,"During the interwar period, the consciousness that national markets in Europe were interdependent though confrontational, along with the observation of a larger and growing US market on the other side of the ocean, nourished the urge for the economic integration of the continent."
21,"During the same decade, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, one of the first to imagine of a modern political union of Europe, founded the Pan-Europa Movement."
22,"His ideas influenced his contemporaries, among which then Prime Minister of France Aristide Briand."
23,"In 1929, the latter gave a speech in favour of a European Union before the assembly of the League of Nations, precursor of the United Nations."
24,"In a radio address in March 1943, with war still raging, Britain's leader Sir Winston Churchill spoke warmly of ""restoring the true greatness of Europe"" once victory had been achieved, and mused on the post-war creation of a ""Council of Europe"" which would bring the European nations together to build peace."
25,"In a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the University of Zürich, Switzerland, Winston Churchill went further and advocated the emergence of a United States of Europe."
26,"The Council focused primarily on values—human rights and democracy—rather than on economic or trade issues, and was always envisaged as a forum where sovereign governments could choose to work together, with no supra-national authority."
27,"It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved."
28,"But in 1952, disappointed at what they saw as the lack of progress within the Council of Europe, six nations decided to go further and created the European Coal and Steel Community, which was declared to be ""a first step in the federation of Europe""."
29,This community helped to economically integrate and coordinate the large number of Marshall Plan funds from the United States.
30,"European leaders Alcide De Gasperi from Italy, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman from France, and Paul-Henri Spaak from Belgium understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, future war between their nations became much less likely."
31,These men and others are officially credited as the founding fathers of the European Union.
32,They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy.
33,The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch.
34,"Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities."
35,"Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum."
36,"In 1985, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states."
37,"In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the EEC and the Single European Act was signed."
38,"In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Communities as part of a reunified Germany."
39,"The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty."
40,"With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993."
41,The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.
42,"In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU."
43,"In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states."
46,"In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the Union."
48,"On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU."
49,"The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, though most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 23:00 GMT on 31 December 2020."
50,"In 2017, approximately 825,000 people acquired citizenship of a member state of the European Union."
51,"The largest groups were nationals of Morocco, Albania, India, Turkey and Pakistan."
55,"The European Commission conducts its internal business in three procedural languages: English, French, and German."
56,"English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being understood by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers."
57,"German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (18% of the EU population), and the second most widely understood foreign language, followed by French (13% of the EU population)."
58,"In addition, both are official languages of several EU member states."
59,"Only four languages, namely Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian (all three Uralic), and Maltese (Semitic), are not Indo-European languages."
60,"On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a ""gesture"" that could help solve the division of the country."
61,"Catalan, Galician and Basque are not recognised official languages of the European Union but have official status in one member state (Spain): therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages."
62,The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.
65,"The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population."
66,Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.
68,"The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in their respective god."
69,"Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those ""positioning themselves on the right of the political scale""."
70,"Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership."
71,"These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law."
72,Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.
73,Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides the basis for a member to leave the Union.
74,"Two territories have left the Union: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985; the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union in 2017, and became the only sovereign state to leave when it withdrew from the EU in 2020."
75,"There are six countries that are recognised as candidates for membership: Albania, Iceland, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey, though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013."
76,"Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates, with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application."
77,"The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties."
78,"The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation."
81,"Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (north-east Europe) to tropical (French Guiana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless."
82,Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.
86,"This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called Kompetenz-kompetenz); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union."
87,"In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined."
88,"The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors."
89,"Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union)."
90,The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank.
91,The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
92,The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors.
93,There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.
94,"EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states."
95,Lobbying at EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.
96,"It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the President of the European Council (currently Charles Michel), the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state (either its head of state or head of government)."
97,The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (currently Josep Borrell) also takes part in its meetings.
98,"It has been described by some as the Union's ""supreme political authority""."
99,It is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.
100,"The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies."
101,"The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg."
102,The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.
103,"It operates de facto as a cabinet government, with 27 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state."
104,"One of the 27 is the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen for 2019–2024), appointed by the European Council, subject to the Parliament's approval."
105,"After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council."
106,The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President.
107,The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by vote of the European Parliament.
108,It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed.
109,"Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body."
110,"In addition to its legislative functions, the council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
111,"In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the Union."
112,"Examples of such alliances include the Visegrad Group, Benelux, the Baltic Assembly, the New Hanseatic League, the Weimar Triangle, the Lublin Triangle, EU Med Group and the Craiova Group."
113,The 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation.
114,MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality.
115,"This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget."
116,"The Parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice."
117,The President of the European Parliament (currently David Sassoli) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally.
118,The President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.
122,The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.
123,The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commission's handling of the budget.
124,"The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level."
125,"In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error."
127,The budget may still be approved if Hungary and Poland withdraw their vetos after further negotiations in the Council and the European Council.
128,In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence.
129,These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation.
130,In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate.
131,"While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not."
132,"Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area."
133,"These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties."
134,These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals.
135,These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.
136,"The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states."
137,"Because of the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy, many judgments of the Court of Justice are automatically applicable within the internal legal orders of the member states."
138,"The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service."
139,Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.
140,"""In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
141,The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged.
142,"It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the ""constitutional traditions common to the member states."""
143,"The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights."
144,Signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.
145,"Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede."
146,The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.
147,"The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas,  especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy."
148,"Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe."
149,The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world.
150,The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition.
151,The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.
152,"Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions."
153,Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result.
154,The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.
155,"When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states."
156,Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation.
157,"They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state."
158,"They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions."
159,"Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy."
160,"The ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament for the length of the Parliament's term, and the position is renewable."
161,"Any EU citizen or entity may appeal to the ombudsman to investigate an EU institution on the grounds of maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay)."
162,Emily O'Reilly is the current ombudsman since 2013.
163,"Accordingly, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice."
164,Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.
165,"In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation."
166,The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities.
167,This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.
168,Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies.
169,In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act.
170,The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.
171,"The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq."
172,"The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment."
173,"The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
174,"The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries."
175,"The demand of Swiss People’s Party (SPP) was, however, turned down, as the voters rejected SPP’s demand for taking back immigration control."
177,"To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process."
178,"EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff."
179,Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders.
180,"It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration."
181,In 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management.
182,"In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states."
183,The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments.
184,"If considered collectively, EU member states are the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world."
185,"These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union."
186,"The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation."
187,"This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country."
188,International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily.
189,"Its role was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro."
190,"Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015)."
191,"The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity."
192,"EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission."
193,It is applied from the principles of Capability approach and Rights-based approach to development.
194,Partnership and cooperation agreements are bilateral agreements with non-member nations.
195,Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls.
196,"The European Union represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes."
197,The currency union represents 342 million EU citizens.
199,There is a significant variation in Nominal GDP per capita within individual EU states.
200,"The difference between the richest and poorest regions (281 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2017, from 31% (Severozapaden, Bulgaria) of the EU28 average (€30,000) to 253% (Luxembourg), or from €4,600 to €92,600."
201,"The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU, and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market."
202,"Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally."
203,"The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union."
204,Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow.
205,Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom.
206,The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.
207,"The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country."
208,"While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas."
209,This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.
210,According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.
211,"In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union."
212,The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
213,"In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining."
214,"In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states."
215,The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.
216,"The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank (ECB)."
217,"The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability."
218,"To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB."
219,Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported.
220,There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.
221,"Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel, LGV Est, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, the Öresund Bridge, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge."
222,The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network.
223,"In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution."
224,"After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda."
225,The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 autostrada.
226,"Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA)."
227,"The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated Global Positioning System, but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system."
228,"The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers."
229,"It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention."
230,These were intervention stores of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels.
231,"To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community."
232,"This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world."
233,"Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004)."
234,"Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size."
235,This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.
236,"One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU."
237,"For example, in 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (GE and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority."
238,"Another high-profile case against Microsoft, resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action."
239,To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards.
240,These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.
241,The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states.
243,A European unemployment insurance has been proposed among others by the commissioner of Jobs Nicolas Schmit.
244,A European Directive about Minimum Wage has also been discussedSince 2019 there is a European Commissioner for Equality; a European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007.
245,Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe.
246,"Several funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU's standard (Phare, ISPA, and SAPARD), and support to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS)."
