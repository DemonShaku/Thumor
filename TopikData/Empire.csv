249,"If this conclusion is warranted, it illuminates our understanding of civilization itself."
250,"Most states systems have ended in universal empire, which has swallowed all the states of the system."
251,The examples are so abundant that we must ask two questions: Is there any states system which has not led fairly directly to the establishment of a world empire?

253,"It might be argued that every state system can only maintain its existence on the balance of power, that the latter is inherently unstable, and that sooner or later its tensions and conflicts will be resolved into a monopoly of power."
254,"Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward."
255,"Fichte's later compatriot, Geographer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), in the mid-Nineteenth century observed a macro-historic trend of imperial growth in both Hemispheres: ""Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole nations, acted under influence of one idea, the purity of which was utterly unknown to them."""
256,The imperial expansion filled the world circa 1900.
258,"His seventh law stated: ""The general trend toward amalgamation transmits the tendency of territorial growth from state to state and increases the tendency in the process of transmission."""
259,"He commented on this law to make its meaning clear: ""There is on this small planet sufficient space for only one great state."
260,"""Two other contemporaries—Kang Yu-wei and George Vacher de Lapouge—stressed that imperial expansion cannot indefinitely proceed on the definite surface of the globe and therefore world empire is imminent."
261,"This undoubtedly is the logical final stage in the geopolitical theory of evolution."""
262,The trend toward world domination or hegemony of a single power is but the ultimate consummation of a power-system engrafted upon an otherwise integrated world.
264,"The year after the War and in the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein and British Philosopher Bertrand Russell, known as prominent pacifists, outlined for the near future a perspective of world empire (world government established by force)."
265,"Einstein believed that, unless world government is established by agreement, an imperial world government would come by war or wars."
266,Russell expected a third World War to result in a world government under the empire of the United States.
267,"Three years later, another prominent pacifist, Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, generalized on the ancient Empires of Egypt, Babylon, Persia and Greece to imply for the modern world: ""The analogy in present global terms would be the final unification of the world through the preponderant power of either America or Russia, whichever proved herself victorious in the final struggle."
268,"""Russian colleague of Russell and Neighbour, Georgy Fedotov, wrote in 1945: All empires are but stages on the way to the sole Empire which must swallow all others."
269,The only question is who will build it and on which foundations.
270,Universal unity is the only alternative to annihilation.
271,Unity by conference is utopian but unity by conquest by the strongest Power is not and probably the uncompleted in this War will be completed in the next.
272,The historical stage for a world empire had already been set prior to and independently of the discovery of atomic weapons but these weapons make a world empire inevitable and imminent.
273,Only a world empire can establish monopoly on atomic weapons and thus guarantee the survival of civilization.
274,"A world empire ""is in fact the objective of the Third World War which, in its preliminary stages, has already began""."
275,"The issue of a world empire ""will be decided, and in our day."
276,"In the course of the decision, both of the present antagonists may, it is true, be destroyed, but one of them must be."""
277,"The year this volume of A Study of History was published, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced ""a knock-out blow"" as an official doctrine, a detailed Plan was elaborated and Fortune magazine mapped the design."
278,"Section VIII, ""Atomic Armaments"", of the famous National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68), approved by President Harry Truman in 1951, uses the term ""blow"" 17 times, mostly preceded by such adjectives as ""powerful"", ""overwhelming"", or ""crippling""."
279,"The warring states of the Twentieth century seem headed for a similar resolution of their conflicts."""
280,"The ancient ""resolution"" McNeill evoked was one of the most sweeping universal conquests in world history, performed by Qin in 230–221 BC."
281,Herman Kahn of the RAND Corporation criticized to an assembled group of SAC officers their war plan (SIOP-62).
282,"He did not use the term bacchanal but he coined on the occasion an associating word: ""Gentlemen, you do not have a war plan."
284,History did not completely repeat itself but it passed close.
285,"The Empires of Egypt, China and Japan are named the most durable political structures in human history."
286,"Correspondingly, these are the three most circumscribed civilizations in human history."
287,"German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck, criticizing the Western idea of progress, emphasized that China and Egypt remained at one particular stage of development for millennia."
288,This stage was universal empire.
289,"The development of Egypt and China came to a halt once their empires ""reached the limits of their natural habitat""."
290,"Sinology does not recognize the Eurocentric view of the ""inevitable"" imperial fall; Egyptology and Japanology pose equal challenges."
291,Carneiro explored the Bronze Age civilizations.
292,"They conclude: The ""rigidity of the borders"" contributed importantly to hegemony in every concerned case."
293,"The circumscribed Chinese Empire recovered from all falls, while the fall of Rome, by contrast, was fatal."
294,"If ""Europe had been a closed system, some great power would eventually have succeeded in establishing absolute supremacy over the other states in the region""."
295,"His 1945 book on the four centuries of the European power struggle, Ludwig Dehio titled The Precarious Balance."
296,"He explained the durability of the European states system by its overseas expansion: ""Overseas expansion and the system of states were born at the same time; the vitality that burst the bounds of the Western world also destroyed its unity."""
297,Edward Carr causally linked the end of the overseas outlet for imperial expansion and World Wars.
298,"In the nineteenth century, he wrote during the Second World War, imperialist wars were waged against ""primitive"" peoples."
299,"Since 1900, however, this has no longer been possible: ""the situation has radically changed""."
300,"Now wars are between ""imperial powers."""
301,"Hans Morgenthau wrote that the very imperial expansion into relatively empty geographical spaces in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, in Africa, Eurasia, and western North America, deflected great power politics into the periphery of the earth, thereby reducing conflict."
302,"For example, the more attention Russia, France and the United States paid to expanding into far-flung territories in imperial fashion, the less attention they paid to one another, and the more peaceful, in a sense, the world was."
303,"But by the late nineteenth century, the consolidation of the great nation-states and empires of the West was consummated, and territorial gains could only be made at the expense of one another."
304,Thus the openness of the world contributed to the consolidation of the territorial system.
305,The end of the 'world frontier' and the resulting closedness of an interdependent world inevitably affected the system's effectiveness.
307,"The opportunity for any system to expand in size seems almost a necessary condition for it to remain balanced, at least over the long haul."
308,"Far from being impossible or exceedingly improbable, systemic hegemony is likely under two conditions: ""when the boundaries of the international system remain stable and no new major powers emerge from outside the system."""
309,"With the system becoming global, further expansion is precluded."
310,"The geopolitical condition of ""global closure"" will remain to the end of history."
311,"Since ""the contemporary international system is global, we can rule out the possibility that geographic expansion of the system will contribute to the emergence of a new balance of power, as it did so many times in the past."""
312,"As Quincy Wright had put it, ""this process can no longer continue without interplanetary wars."
313,"""One of leading experts on world-system theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system, since the global system is circumscribed."
314,"In fact, within less than a century of its circumscribed existence the global system overcame the centuries-old balance of power and reached the unipolarity."
315,"Once the state of entropy is reached, there is no going back."
316,The initial conditions are lost forever.
317,"Stressing the curiosity of the fact, Schweller writes that since the moment the modern world became a closed system, the process has worked in only one direction: from many poles to two poles to one pole."
318,Thus unipolarity might represent the entropy—stable and permanent loss of variation—in the global system.
319,"After the war is over, it is tempting for the victor to retain such bases and easy to find reasons to do so."
320,"Commonly, preparedness for a possible resumption of hostilities will be invoked."
321,"Over time, if a nation’s aims become imperial, the bases form the skeleton of an empire."
323,"A Defense Department map of the world, which shows the areas of responsibility of the five major regional commands, suggests that America's sphere of military influence is now literally global … The regional combatant commanders—the 'pro-consuls' of this imperium—have responsibility for swaths of territory beyond the wildest imaginings of their Roman predecessors."
324,"Another Harvard Historian Charles S. Maier opens his Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors with these words: ""What a substratum for empire!"
325,"Compared with which, the foundation of the Macedonian, the Roman and the British, sink into insignificance."
326,"""One of the most accepted distinctions between earlier empires and the American Empire is the latter's “global” or “planetary” scope."
327,"The quests for universal empire are old but the present quest outdoes the previous in ""the notable respect of being the first to actually be global in its reach."""
328,The Pax Britannica was run on the cheap.
330,Charlemagne’s empire was merely western European in stretch.
331,"The Roman Empire stretched further afield, but there was another great empire in Persia and a larger one in China."
333,"Walter Russell Mead observes that the United States attempts to repeate “globally” what the ancient empires of Egypt, China and Rome had each accomplished on a regional basis."
335,Niall Ferguson lists numerous parallels between them and the United States.
336,All dominant empires thought they were special.
338,The Occident was an open area.
339,"But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified… And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars."
340,"Fifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet."
341,"“But how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?”During the same time, Quincy Wright developed a similar concept."
342,Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire.
343,"In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly reemerged, but on ever-wider scale."
344,"Eventually, the scale became global."
345,"Unless we proceed to “interplanetary wars,” this pattern can no longer continue."
346,They worked with historical atlases but the advent of YouTube provided us with a better visualization.
347,They reached the same conclusion—that a world empire is pre-determined—and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.
348,Naroll and Carneiro found that this time is close at hand: around the year 2200 and 2300 respectively.
349,They will try to find an escape.
350,"But they will try in vain… At the end of the war the crushing superiority of American plane production will be an established fact… The solution of the problem … is by no means ideal, nor even satisfactory."
353,"Coudenhove-Kalergi's follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, supposed the traditional way of universal conquest and emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: ""…Hitler's eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures…"" But ""in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact."""
354,"John Ikenberry finds that the Europeans wanted a stronger, more formal and more imperial system than the United States was initially willing to provide."
355,"In 1951, before he became President, he had written on West Europe: “We cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers."
356,"Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward."
357,"Dimitri Simes finds that most of the world sees the United States as a ""nascent"" imperial power."
358,Some scholars concerned how this empire would look in its ultimate form.
359,The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his Empires.
360,It is empire in which its two main components—the ruling core and the ruled periphery—merged to form one integrated whole.
361,At this stage the empire as defined ceases to exist and becomes world state.
362,"Replying on criticism, Wendt invoked the example of the Roman Empire: A ""world empire would be an unstable equilibrium, still subject to the struggle for recognition."""
363,Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies.
364,"The article is partly a reply on the  published a year earlier bestseller The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers which predicted imminent US ""imperial overstretch."""
365,"There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest."
367,"When such a reformation occurs in our world, he writes, the green card would be abolished since all earth inhabitants would have it by birth."
368,"This cosmopolitan World State, as the records of earlier circumscribed civilizations suggest, will last millennia."
