0,"Research is ""creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge""."
1,"It involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase understanding of a topic or issue."
2,A research project may be an expansion on past work in the field.
3,"To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole."
4,"The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge."
5,"Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences."
6,"There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc."
7,The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.
8,The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.
9,"One definition of research is used by the OECD, ""Any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications."
10,This material is of a primary-source character.
11,"Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to."
12,"In analytical work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem."
13,This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world.
14,It makes practical applications possible.
15,"Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies."
16,Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines.
17,"Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it."
18,"Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic."
19,"An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in historical method."
20,"Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past."
21,"Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these."
22,It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.
24,The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow.
25,A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable.
26,The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
27,Hypothesis: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
28,Conceptual definition: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
29,Operational definition: Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
30,"Gathering of data: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments."
31,The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
32,Analysis of data: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
33,"Data Interpretation: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words."
35,"Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment."
36,"If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see falsifiability)."
37,"However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis."
38,This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations.
39,"In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true."
40,"A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified."
41,"As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction."
42,"In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it."
43,"Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables."
44,"There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis."
45,This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism.
46,One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods.
47,"It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality."
48,"Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."""
49,Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.
50,A simpler understanding by Julian Klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception.
51,"Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction books, also have to do research to support their creative work."
52,"This may be factual, historical, or background research."
53,"The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of EUA (European University Association) name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / PhD in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / PhD The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC, CILECT, CUMULUS and SAR."
54,"The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results."
56,"Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study."
57,The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study.
58,"Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified."
59,"A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question."
60,The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis.
61,The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.
64,The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated.
65,"At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for further research."
66,"However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving ""up"" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review."
67,"The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted."
68,"It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."
73,"that is analyzed, and searching for themes."
74,This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables.
75,It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects.
76,Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.
78,"The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive)."
79,Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.
80,"These methods produce results that can be summarized, compared, and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies."
81,"If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable."
82,"Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires."
83,"Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research."
84,"research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common."
85,This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer.
89,"As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source."
90,"This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge."
91,Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach.
92,Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science.
93,"Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on."
95,A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge.
96,Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature.
97,"Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects."
98,"Historically, the revelation of scandals such as Nazi human experimentation and the Tuskegee syphilis experiment led to the realisation that clear measures are needed for the ethical governance of research to ensure that people, animals and environments are not unduly harmed in research."
99,The management of research ethics is inconsistent across countries and there is no universally accepted approach to how it should be addressed.
100,Informed consent is a key concept in research ethics.
101,"When making ethical decisions, we may be guided by different things and philosophers commonly distinguish between approaches like deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics and value (ethics)."
102,"Regardless of approach, the application of ethical theory to specific controversial topics is known as applied ethics and research ethics can be viewed as a form of applied ethics because ethical theory is applied in real-world research scenarios."
103,Ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving human experimentation or animal experimentation.
104,"There may also be consequences for the environment, for society or for future generations that need to be considered."
107,"Also known as ""research on research"", it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields."
108,"Meta-research concerns itself with the detection of bias, methodological flaws, and other errors and inefficiencies."
109,Among the finding of meta-research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields.
110,"This widespread difficulty in reproducing research has been termed the ""replication crisis."""
111,Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study.
112,The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection.
113,Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies.
114,"For example, ""Hua Oranga"" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in Māori populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – ""taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)""."
115,Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication.
116,"As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals."
117,"Since 2000, Latin American countries have become more popular in single-country studies."
118,"In contrast, countries in Oceania and the Caribbean are the focus of very few studies."
119,Patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism: countries whose official languages are French or Arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single-country studies than countries with different official languages.
120,"Within Africa, English-speaking countries are more represented than other countries."
121,"Studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability, meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions."
122,"In comparative politics, this can result from using a single-country study, rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries."
123,"Despite the issue of generalizability, single-country studies have risen in prevalence since the late 2000s."
124,"Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility."
125,"In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication."
126,"Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge."
127,The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review.
128,"It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry."
129,"These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide."
130,This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation.
131,"indigenous communities) this is denounced as ""access control"" and reprehended as censorship."
132,Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.
133,This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West.
134,"Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion."
135,"In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research."
136,"The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly."
137,Most academic work is published in journal article or book form.
138,There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form.
139,These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations.
140,"In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine."
141,"Most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields."
142,"The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format."
143,A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.
144,It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings.
145,Business models are different in the electronic environment.
146,"Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common."
147,"Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access."
148,"There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and self-archiving, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web."
149,These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors.
