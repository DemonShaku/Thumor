0,A tradition is a belief or behavior (folk custom) passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.
1,"A component of folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings."
3,"While it is commonly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time."
4,Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.
5,"The phrase ""according to tradition"", or ""by tradition"", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence."
6,Tradition is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed.
7,"For example, ""According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs."""
8,This tradition may never be proven or disproven.
9,"In another example, ""King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."""
10,Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.
11,"Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in social sciences such as folklore studies, anthropology, archaeology, and biology."
12,"The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse."
13,"For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism."
14,"In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form."
15,"For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences."
16,"A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups."
17,"In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages."
18,"Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts."
19,"Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a writing system."
20,Tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme and alliteration.
21,"The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an oral tradition."
22,"Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been ""invented"" by humans) at some point."
23,"Traditions are often presumed to be ancient, unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less ""natural"" than is presumed."
24,"It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional."
25,"Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution."
26,"Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition."
27,"Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant."
28,"beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments, such as national anthems and national holidays, such as Federal holidays in the United States."
29,"beliefs or customs maintained by religious denominations and Church bodies that share history, customs, culture, and, to some extent, body of teachings."
30,"Rituals of social interaction can be traditional, with phrases and gestures such as saying ""thank you"", sending birth announcements, greeting cards, etc."
31,"Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups (family traditions at Christmas), organizations (company's picnic) or societies, such as the practice of national and public holidays."
32,Some of the oldest traditions include monotheism (three millennia) and citizenship (two millennia).
33,"In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations."
34,"Similarly, most of the traditions associated with monarchy of the United Kingdom, seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century."
35,Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.
36,"Requiring legitimacy, the colonial power would often invent a ""tradition"" which they could use to legitimize their own position."
37,"For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job."
38,"Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation."
39,"Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism."
40,"Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see national dish)."
41,Expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.
43,"For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it."
44,"Unlike myth, which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper."
45,"It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, psychology and sociology."
46,Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis.
48,"Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, ""tradition"" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals."
49,"Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines."
50,"There is however no ""theory of tradition"", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical)."
51,There are however dissenting views; scholars such as Pascal Boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.
52,The term is especially common in the study of American archaeology.
53,"Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed."
54,"Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change."
55,Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns.
56,"Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time."
57,While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'  they differ in their methodology and subject of research.
58,"'Tradition, or traditions, can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective.'"
59,This approach was most notably portrayed in Max Weber's concepts of traditional authority and modern rational-legal authority.
60,"It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action."
61,"In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as ""it has always been that way""."
62,"This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem), which takes the form ""this is right because we've always done it this way."""
63,"In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the ""tradition"" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity."
64,"Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe."
65,"Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following Martin Heidegger, call 'the tradition', which began with Plato and Aristotle."
66,"In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of Aristotelianism."
67,This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by Alasdair MacIntyre.
68,"However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing Aristotelianism as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others."
69,"In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values."
70,"Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition."
71,"For example, the term ""traditionalist Catholic"" refers to those, such as Archbishop Lefebvre, who want the worship and practices of the Church to be as they were before the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65."
73,"More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum, with right-wing parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than left-wing ones."
74,"Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply traditionalism), which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, hierarchy and organic unity, agrarianism, classicism and high culture, and the intersecting spheres of loyalty."
75,"Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, but promote cultural and educational renewal, and revive interest in the Church, the family, the State and local community."
76,"Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another."
77,It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.
78,"For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to creativity, with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to fine art, which is valued for being original and unique."
79,"More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression."
80,"This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern."
81,"Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing filial piety, harmony and group welfare, stability, and interdependence, while a society exhibiting modernity would value ""individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress."""
82,"Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition."
83,"Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change."
84,"Whereas justification for tradition is ideological, the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical."
85,"Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose."
86,"For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional."
87,"In addition to the fundamental protection of cultural property, there is also cooperation between the United Nations, UNESCO and Blue Shield International in the protection or recording of traditions and customs."
88,The protection of culture and traditions is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally.
89,"It is also about preserving the cultural heritage of mankind, especially in the event of war and armed conflict."
90,"According to Karl von Habsburg, President Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets, traditions and languages is also part of psychological warfare."
91,The target of the attack is the opponent's identity.
92,"A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups."
93,Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.
94,"Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as Cornish under the auspices of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
95,"Specifically, the charter holds that these languages ""contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions""."
96,"Similarly, UNESCO includes both ""oral tradition"" and ""traditional manifestations"" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage."
