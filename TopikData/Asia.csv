0,"Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres."
1,It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.
2,"The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations."
3,"Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions."
4,"The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them."
5,It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.
6,"The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line."
7,"China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism."
8,The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination.
9,The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route.
10,"Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen."
11,"Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions."
12,"Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography."
13,"Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems."
14,"It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the  continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia."
15,"This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa."
16,"Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC."
17,"During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River)."
18,"This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy."
19,The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.
20,"The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721."
21,Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg.
22,The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary.
23,Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century.
24,The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.
25,"The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north."
26,"The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania."
27,"The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception."
28,The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European).
30,"Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf."
31,"Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate."
32,"The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, ""Asia""."
33,"Whether ""Asia"" in other languages comes from Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published."
34,One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.
35,"This metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as Scandinavia (from Scania)."
36,"Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire, the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia."
37,These records are administrative and do not include poetry.
38,The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time.
39,"The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B, deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, Michael Ventris, subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick."
40,A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.
41,Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals).
42,"They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children."
43,"The epithet lawiaiai, ""captives"", associated with some of them identifies their origin."
46,"Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus, a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks."
47,Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.
48,"The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female from there."
49,"There is a masculine form, aswios."
50,"This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or ""Roman Asia""."
51,"This name, Assuwa, has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent ""Asia""."
52,"The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE."
53,"Alternatively, the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word (w)aṣû(m), which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning 'east'."
54,"This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe, as being from Akkadian erēbu(m) 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun)."
55,"Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu, meaning 'east' in Assyrian (ereb for Europe meaning 'west')."
56,"The ideas of Occidental (form Latin occidens 'setting') and Oriental (from Latin oriens for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with Western and Eastern."
57,"Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent."
58,Kazuo Ogura and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.
60,"The Romans named a province Asia, located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey)."
61,There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day Iraq.
62,"As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act."
63,"The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus, who were all Greek."
64,"He defines it carefully, mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing."
65,"By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt."
66,"Hesione), but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis."
67,"The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became ""Greek mythology""."
68,"For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean, among whom are a ""holy company"", ""who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping""."
71,"The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia) in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning ""Asian""); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος."
72,"According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses."
73,"The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys."
74,"The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities."

76,"Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area."
77,"Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands."
78,The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes.
79,"The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided."
80,"The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra."
81,These areas remained very sparsely populated.
82,The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.
83,The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.
84,"While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe."
85,"However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies."
86,The Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century.

106,Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia.
107,"The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer."
108,Southwestern sections of the continent are hot.
109,"Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America."

113,"The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change."
115,"The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy."
119,"According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE."
