0,"Imperialism is a policy or ideology of extending the rule over peoples and other countries, for extending political and economic access, power and control, often through employing hard power especially military force, but also soft power."
1,"While related to the concepts of colonialism and empire, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government."
2,"Expansionism and centralisation have existed throughout recorded history by states, with the earliest examples dating back to the mid-third millennium BC."
3,"However, the concept of imperialism arose in the modern age, associated chiefly with the European colonial powers of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and New Imperialism."
4,"Following the decolonization of European holdings, the concept has further evolved and has been broadly used to identify as well as criticise a range of policies and a number of states, including even supposedly anti-imperialist states."
5,"It first became common in the current sense in Great Britain during the 1870s, when it was used with a negative connotation."
6,"Previously, the term had been used to describe what was perceived as Napoleon III's attempts at obtaining political support through foreign military interventions."
7,"The term was and is mainly applied to Western and Japanese political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries."
8,Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.
9,"Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised around an imperial core and a periphery."
10,This definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism.
11,"Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people."
12,"Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the centre, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions."
13,"However, colonialism still includes invasion."
14,Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power.
15,"Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; ""imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'"
16,"Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of another, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally."
17,Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism.
18,Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled.
19,Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.
20,"The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance."
21,Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.
22,"Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure, and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."
23,Few colonies remain remote from their mother country.
24,This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in the modern era.
25,Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
26,European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory.
27,The two main regions are the core and the periphery.
28,The core consists of areas of high income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit.
29,These critical theories of geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world.
30,"19th century episodes included the ""Scramble for Africa."""
32,Much more important was informal control of independent areas.
34,"Roger Louis, ""In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red."
35,"The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire."
36,"Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'"""
37,"Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they ""found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion."
38,"Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations."
39,"""Looking at the main empires from 1875 to 1914, there was a mixed record in terms of profitability."
40,"At first, planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items."
41,"Apart from the Indian subcontinent, this was seldom true."
42,"By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector."
43,"Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India, especially Mughal Bengal, but not from most of the rest of its empire."
44,The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies.
45,Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires.
46,France did slightly better.
47,The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise.
48,"However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable."
49,"The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the ""British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance"" for the establishment of control over the subcontinent's resources, markets, and manpower."
50,"The second expansion of Europe was a complex historical process in which political, social and emotional forces in Europe and on the periphery were more influential than calculated imperialism."
51,"Individual colonies might serve an economic purpose; collectively no empire had any definable function, economic or otherwise."
52,Empires represented only a particular phase in the ever-changing relationship of Europe with the rest of the world: analogies with industrial systems or investment in real estate were simply misleading.
53,"During this time, European merchants had the ability to ""roam the high seas and appropriate surpluses from around the world (sometimes peaceably, sometimes violently) and to concentrate them in Europe""."
54,European expansion greatly accelerated in the 19th century.
55,"To obtain raw materials, Europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies."
56,"European industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes, cotton, vegetable oils, and metal ores from overseas."
57,"With the invention of railroads and telegraphs, it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies."
58,European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly.
59,"By the 1880s, the machine gun had become a reliable battlefield weapon."
61,"Some exceptions of armies that managed to get nearly on par with the European expeditions and standards include the Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Adwa, and the Japanese Imperial Army of Japan, but these still relied heavily on weapons imported from Europe and often on European military advisors."
62,The term imperialism was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.
63,"Supporters of ""imperialism"" such as Joseph Chamberlain quickly appropriated the concept."
64,"For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed."
65,In Imperialism he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home.
66,"It was invested abroad because of lower wages paid to the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages."
67,"So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise."
68,"Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living."
69,The British experience failed to support it.
70,"However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)."
71,"Lenin portrayed Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion."
72,"Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism, which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets."
73,"Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades."
74,"As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal."
75,Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J.
76,"While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years."
77,"Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s."
78,Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation.
79,"As a result, Imperialism ""for many years embraced the whole world – one part being the exploiters and the other the exploited, one part being dominated and the other acting as overlords, one part making policy and the other being dependent."
80,"""Imperialism has also been identified in newer phenomena like space development and its governing context."
81,"Defining the East as a negative vision of the Western world, as its inferior, not only increased the sense-of-self of the West, but also was a way of ordering the East, and making it known to the West, so that it could be dominated and controlled."
82,"Therefore, Orientalism was the ideological justification of early Western imperialism—a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other, non-white peoples."
83,"Cartography is ""the art, science and technology of making maps"" but this definition is problematic."
84,It implies that maps are objective representations of the world when in reality they serve very political means.
85,"For Harley, maps serve as an example of Foucault's power and knowledge concept."
87,"He states that maps ""contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa""."
88,"During his analysis of 19th-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory."
89,"According to Bassett, ""[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground."
90,"Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy"" but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them."
91,"One of such empires was the Roman Empire, the name giver to imperialism."
92,"a form of soft power, which changes the moral, cultural, and societal worldview of the subordinate country."
93,"This means more than just ""foreign"" music, television or film becoming popular with young people; rather that a populace changes its own expectations of life, desiring for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted."
94,"For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea."
95,"The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc."
96,"Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants."
97,"Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy."
98,"They provided stability, security, and legal order for their subjects."
99,"They constrained, and at their best, tried to transcend, the potentially savage ethnic or religious antagonisms among the peoples."
100,"And the aristocracies which ruled most of them were often far more liberal, humane, and cosmopolitan than their supposedly ever more democratic successors."
101,A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.
102,"In ancient China, Tianxia denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order."
103,"The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, tributary states, and finally ending with the fringe ""barbarians""."
104,Tianxia's idea of hierarchy gave Chinese a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace.
107,Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons.
108,"Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed."
109,Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.
110,"The purportedly scientific nature of ""Social Darwinism"" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism."
112,They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.
113,"The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America ""whiteness"" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common."
114,The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.
115,These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.
116,Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism.
117,"For instance, American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone."
118,"Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said's Orientalism as the west's construction of the east as the ""other""."
119,"The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire ""during the last generation, and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description""."
120,British imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions appears to have applied a principle now termed Terra nullius (Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning 'no man's land').
121,"The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the 18th century, that was arguably premised on terra nullius, as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants."
122,The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and thus validated their domination.
123,"For example, the Western world saw people living in tropical environments as ""less civilized"", therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission."
124,"Across the three major waves of European colonialism (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), environmental determinism served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy."
125,"This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality."
126,Some geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into climatic zones.
127,"These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being."
128,"In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy."
129,The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.
130,"Similarly, orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location."
131,"Some anti-imperialist groups who opposed the United States supported the power of the Soviet Union, such as in Guevarism, while in Maoism this was criticized as social imperialism."
132,In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year.
133,Most of these colonies were either aborted or collapsed quickly for various reasons.
135,"In 1767, the Anglo-Mysore Wars and other political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy."
136,"By the year 1670 Britain's imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda, Honduras, Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica and Nova Scotia."
137,"Due to the vast imperialist ambitions of European countries, Britain had several clashes with France."
138,This competition was evident in the colonization of what is now known as Canada.
139,"Britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as New Zealand and Australia, both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures."
140,Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776.
141,"Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in about 1820."
142,"By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world."
143,"After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific."
144,"Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe."
145,"Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (""British Peace""), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman."
146,"However, this peace was mostly a perceived one from Europe, and the period was still an almost uninterrupted series of colonial wars and disputes."
147,"The British Conquest of India, its intervention against Mehemet Ali, the Anglo-Burmese Wars, the Crimean War, the Opium Wars and the Scramble for Africa to name the most notable conflicts mobilised ample military means to press Britain's lead in the global conquest Europe led across the century."
148,"In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the ""workshop of the world""."
149,"The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world."
150,"Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America."
151,"Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise."
152,"During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses."
153,"To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere."
154,"Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions."
155,A resurgence came in the late 19th century with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East.
156,"The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury, and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes."
157,The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning and legitimation during this time.
158,"Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer, Lord Curzon, General Kitchener, Lord Milner, and the writer Rudyard Kipling."
159,The British Empire was the largest Empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population.
160,"Its power, both military and economic, remained unmatched for a few decades."
161,"After the First Boer War, the South African Republic and Orange Free State were recognised by Britain but eventually re-annexed after the Second Boer War."
162,"But British power was fading, as the reunited German state founded by the Kingdom of Prussia posed a growing threat to Britain's dominance."
164,But Britain gained control of former German and Ottoman colonies with the League of Nations mandate.
165,Britain now had a practically continuous line of controlled territories from Egypt to Burma and another one from Cairo to Cape Town.
166,"However, this period was also the one of the emergence of independence movements based on nationalism and new experiences the colonists had gained in the war."
167,"World War II decisively weakened Britain's position in the world, especially financially."
168,"Decolonization movements arose nearly everywhere in the Empire, resulting in Indian independence and partition in 1947 and the establishment of independent states in the 1950s."
169,British imperialism showed its frailty in Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956.
170,"However, with the United States and Soviet Union emerging from World War II as the sole superpowers, Britain's role as a worldwide power declined significantly and rapidly."
171,"Due to its long history of imperialist expansion, China has been seen by its neighboring countries as a threat due to its large population, giant economy, large military force as well as its territorial evolution throughout history."
172,"Starting with the unification of China under the Qin dynasty, later Chinese dynasties continued to follow its form of expansions."
173,"The most successful Chinese imperial dynasties in terms of territorial expansion were the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing dynasties."
174,"At its apex there were colonies on four continents: Europe, North America, Africa and Asia."
175,"In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in West Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent."
176,"Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe."
177,Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar  on India's southern coast in 1620.
178,Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.
179,"After 1814, when Norway was ceded to Sweden, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings."
180,One by one the smaller colonies were lost or sold.
184,"Today, the only remaining vestiges are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953."
185,They are now autonomous territories.
186,It was followed by French East India Company's trading posts in Africa and Asia in the 17th century.
187,"France had its ""First colonial empire"" from 1534 until 1814, including New France (Canada, Acadia, Newfoundland and Louisiana), French West Indies (Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe, Martinique), French Guiana, Senegal (Gorée), Mascarene Islands (Mauritius Island, Réunion) and French India."
188,"Its ""Second colonial empire"" began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830 and came for the most part to an end with the granting of independence to Algeria in 1962."
189,"The French imperial history was marked by numerous wars, large and small, and also by significant help to France itself from the colonials in the world wars."
190,"France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa (French North Africa, French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa), as well as South-East Asia (French Indochina), with other conquests in the South Pacific (New Caledonia, French Polynesia)."
191,France also twice attempted to make Mexico a colony in 1838–39 and in 1861-67 (see Pastry War and Second French intervention in Mexico).
192,"French Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire."
193,"As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism."
194,It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars.
195,It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture.
196,"In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: ""The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior""."
197,"Full citizenship rights – assimilation – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon."
198,"Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."
201,"However, after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire."
202,France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s.
203,"Whereas they won the war in Algeria, de Gaulle decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962."
204,French settlers and many local supporters relocated to France.
205,"Nearly all of France's colonies gained independence by 1960, but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence."
206,It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d'état.
207,"They did not establish colonial school systems with the idea of furthering the ambitions of the local people, but rather simply exported the systems and methods in vogue in the mother nation."
208,Having a moderately trained lower bureaucracy was of great use to colonial officials.
209,The emerging French-educated indigenous elite saw little value in educating rural peoples.
210,After 1946 the policy was to bring the best students to Paris for advanced training.
211,The result was to immerse the next generation of leaders in the growing anti-colonial diaspora centered in Paris.
212,Impressionistic colonials could mingle with studious scholars or radical revolutionaries or so everything in between.
213,"The colony was administered by Paul Cambon, who built an educational system for colonists and indigenous people alike that was closely modeled on mainland France."
214,He emphasized female and vocational education.
215,The French set up schools based on the scientific method and French culture.
216,The Pied-Noir (Catholic migrants from Europe) welcomed this.
217,"Those goals were rejected by the Moslem Arabs, who prized mental agility and their distinctive religious tradition."
218,They sharply disagreed on goals.
219,The French educators sought to preserving French culture among the Vietnamese elites and relied on the Mission Culturelle – the heir of the colonial Direction of Education – and its prestigious high schools.
220,The Americans looked at the great mass of people and sought to make South Vietnam a nation strong enough to stop communism.
221,"The Americans had far more money, as USAID coordinated and funded the activities of expert teams, and particularly of academic missions."
222,The French deeply resented the American invasion of their historical zone of cultural imperialism.
223,The concept of Drang Nach Osten was a core element of German nationalism and a major element of Nazi ideology.
224,"However, the German involvement in the seizure of overseas territories was negligible until the end of the 19th century."
225,Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire in 1871.
226,"Its Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits."
227,In 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific.
228,The Treaty of Versailles made them mandates temporarily operated by the Allied victors.
229,Germany also lost part of the Eastern territories that became part of independent Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
230,"Finally, the Eastern territories captured in the Middle Ages were torn from Germany and became part of Poland and the USSR as a result of the territorial reorganization established by the Potsdam conference of the great powers in 1945."
232,"This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882, becoming modern Italy's first overseas territory."
234,"Outside Africa, Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey (following the Italo-Turkish War) and a small concession in Tianjin in China following the Boxer War of 1900."
235,"During the First World War, Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary."
236,"In 1917, it established a protectorate over Albania, which remained in place until 1920."
237,The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists.
238,"In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935–36, Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa."
239,"In 1939, Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state."
241,It was forced in the peace treaty of 1947 to relinquish sovereignty over all its colonies.
242,It was granted a trust to administer former Italian Somaliland under United Nations supervision in 1950.
243,"When Somalia became independent in 1960, Italy's eight-decade experiment with colonialism ended."
244,"However, in the 1850s, military pressure from the United States and other world powers coerced Japan to open itself to the global market, resulting in an end to the country's isolation."
245,"A period of conflicts and political revolutions followed due to socioeconomic uncertainty, ending in 1868 with the reunification of political power under the Japanese Emperor during the Meiji Restoration."
246,This sparked a period of rapid industrialization driven in part by a Japanese desire for self-sufficiency.
247,In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan.
248,"For centuries, Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces."
250,"At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens."
251,"They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared, and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent, which was a success."
252,The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese in the Formosa Expedition of 1867.
253,"Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series."
257,"As a result of winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia."
258,"Precisely, the victory against the Russian Empire shook the world: never before had an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat."
