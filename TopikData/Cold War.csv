0,"The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II."
1,"Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but the period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union."
2,"The term ""cold"" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars."
3,"The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945."
4,The doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side.
5,"Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race."
6,"The West was led by the United States as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of authoritarian states, most of which were their former colonies."
7,"The East was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World."
8,"The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world."
9,"As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945–1960, they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War."
10,The first phase of the Cold War began immediately after the end of the Second World War in 1945.
11,The United States created the NATO military alliance in 1949 in the apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed their global policy against Soviet influence containment.
12,The Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955 in response to NATO.
13,"Major crises of this phase included the 1948–49 Berlin Blockade, the 1927–50 Chinese Civil War, the 1950–53 Korean War, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis."
14,"The USSR and the US competed for influence in Latin America, the Middle East, and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia."
15,"Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater autonomy of action."
16,"The USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the 1968 Prague Spring, while the US experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War."
17,"In the 1960s–70s, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world."
18,"Movements against nuclear arms testing and for nuclear disarmament took place, with large anti-war protests."
19,"By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of détente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the USSR."
20,Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979.
21,The early 1980s were another period of elevated tension.
22,"The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from economic stagnation."
23,"Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer."
24,"In 1989, the fall of the Iron Curtain and a wave of revolutions (with the exception of Romania) peacefully overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe."
25,The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991.
26,"This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of its constituent republics and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia."
27,The United States was left as the world's only superpower.
28,The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy.
29,"It is often referred to in popular culture, especially with themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare."
30,"In The Observer of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, ""after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire."
31,"""The first use of the term to describe the specific post-war geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by Bernard Baruch, an influential advisor to Democratic presidents, on 16 April 1947."
32,"The speech, written by a journalist Herbert Bayard Swope, proclaimed, ""Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war."""
33,Newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency with his book The Cold War.
34,"When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, la guerre froide."
35,"The Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November 1917 and fulfilled their promise to withdraw from WWI, and German armies advanced rapidly across the borderlands."
36,The Allies responded with an economic blockade against all of Russia.
37,"In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of popular disgust against the war and accepted harsh German peace terms with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
38,"In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany to win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front and by ""relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe."""
39,"According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, ""The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War."
40,"With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention,"" and proceeded to step up their ""economic warfare"" against the Bolsheviks."
41,"This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War Winston Churchill, a committed British imperialist and anti-communist."
42,"France, Japan and the United States invaded Russia in an attempt to topple the new Soviet government."
43,"Vladimir Lenin stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a ""hostile capitalist encirclement"" and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided."
44,"He set up an organization to promote sister revolutions worldwide, the Comintern."
45,"It failed everywhere; it was crushed when it tried to start revolutions in Germany, Bavaria, and Hungary."
46,The failures led to an inward turn by Moscow.
47,Britain and other Western powers—except the United States—did business and sometimes recognized the new Soviet Union.
48,"By 1933, old fears of Communist threats had faded, and the American business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition."
49,"However, there was no progress on the Tsarist debts Washington wanted Moscow to repay."
50,Expectations of expanded trade proved unrealistic.
51,Roosevelt named William Bullitt as ambassador from 1933 to 1936.
52,"Bullitt arrived in Moscow with high hopes for Soviet–American relations, but his view of the Soviet leadership soured on closer inspection."
53,"By the end of his tenure, Bullitt was openly hostile to the Soviet government, and he remained an outspoken anti-communist for the rest of his life."
54,The Soviets were embittered when Western governments chose to practice appeasement with Nazi Germany instead.
55,In March 1939 Britain and France—without consulting the USSR—granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the Munich Agreement.
56,"Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939."
57,The resulting Winter War ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.
58,"It also seized the disputed Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Hertza."
59,"But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers worked together to fight Germany."
60,Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement.
61,"In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its Lend-Lease Program."
62,"However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany."
63,"According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement."
64,"Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers."
65,Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.
66,"Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations."
67,Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world.
68,"Roosevelt's goals—military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, and the creation of a world peace organization—were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom."
69,The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries in its border regions.
70,"During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control."
71,"Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties."
72,"With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors."
73,The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets.
74,"In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the ""percentages agreement"" to divide Europe into respective spheres of influence, including giving Stalin predominance over Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche over Greece."
75,This proposal was accepted by Stalin.
76,"At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin regarding Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations."
77,"Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement, but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe."
78,"However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states."
79,"On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the US occupation directive JCS 1067, which was in effect for over two years, and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin."
80,The Soviet Union was not allowed to participate and the dispute led to heated correspondence between Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin.
81,"Wolff, a war criminal, appears to have been guaranteed immunity at the Nuremberg trials by Office of Strategic Services (OSS) commander and future CIA director Allen Dulles when they met in March 1945."
82,"Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune."
83,"The Soviets pressed their demand made at Yalta, for $20 billion of reparations to be taken from Germany occupation zones."
84,"The Americans and British refused to fix a dollar amount for reparations, but they permitted the Soviets to remove some industry from their zones."
85,"Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions, and to entrench their positions."
86,"Stalin was aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb, and he reacted to the news calmly."
87,"One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
88,"Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan."
89,"Under the leadership of Lyuh Woon-Hyung, working secretly during Japanese occupation, committees throughout Korea formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence."
90,"Following Japanese surrender, on August 28, 1945 these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the People's Republic of Korea (PRK) a couple of weeks later."
91,"On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the 38th parallel north."
94,"After World War II, US officials guided Western European leaders in establishing their own secret security force to prevent subversion in the Western bloc, which evolved into Operation Gladio."
95,The Truman Administration was receptive to the telegram due to broken promises by Stalin concerning Europe and Iran.
96,"Following the WWII Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south."
97,"Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities."
98,"However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the People's Republic of Azerbaijan and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad."
99,"Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech in Fulton, Missouri."
100,"He argued that there was nothing surprising in ""the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries""."
101,"In September, the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and ""co-authored"" by Vyacheslav Molotov; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability ""to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war""."
102,"In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Kingdom of Greece in its civil war against Communist-led insurgents."
103,"The US government responded to this announcement by adopting a policy of containment, with the goal of stopping the spread of Communism."
104,"Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes."
105,American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the British-backed government.
106,(The insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against Stalin's wishes.
107,")Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter."
108,"Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956."
109,"Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-nuclear movement."
110,"In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union."
111,"Later, the program led to the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation."
112,"The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections."
113,The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.
114,"One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC)."
115,Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.
116,"The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance)."
117,"With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war."
118,Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist–Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948.
119,"The most famous and active organizations were the American CIA, the Soviet KGB, and the British MI6."
120,"The East German Stasi, unlike the others, was primarily concerned with internal security, but its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance operated espionage activities around the world."
121,The CIA secretly subsidized and promoted anti-communist cultural activities and organizations.
122,"The CIA was also involved in European politics, especially in Italy."
123,"However, the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT (espionage) and ""sometimes in its reach into high policy circles."""
125,"Similarly, there is no evidence, on either side, of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side."
126,"Until the break between Tito and Stalin, the Western powers and the Eastern bloc faced each other uncompromisingly."
127,"In addition to capitalism and communism, Italians and Slovenes, monarchists and republicans as well as war winners and losers often faced each other irreconcilably."
128,"The neutral buffer state Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the United Nations, was split up and dissolved in 1954 and 1975, also because of the détente between the West and Tito."
129,"As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system."
130,"In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the west German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased."
131,"The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower ""in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements."
132,"""Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin."
133,The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self.
134,"300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue, and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created ""Operation Vittles"", which supplied candy to German children."
135,Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.
136,"That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR."
137,"Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949."
138,"Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party."
139,"Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press."
140,"The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world."
141,"In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO."
142,"According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China."
143,"Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan."
144,"Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism."
145,Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of Taiwan.
146,"Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment doctrine."
147,"In NSC 68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council instituted a Machiavellian policy  while proposing to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense."
148,"In this way, this US would exercise ""preponderant power,"" oppose neutrality, and establish global hegemony."
149,"In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the ""Pactomania""), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases."
150,"In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel."
151,Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion but ultimately sent advisers.
152,"To Stalin's surprise, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan, not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council."
153,"A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States."
154,The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war.
155,This directed the US's action to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty while allowing North Korea's survival as a state.
156,General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th Parallel into North Korea.
157,"Truman publicly hinted that he might use his ""ace in the hole"" of the atomic bomb, but Mao was unmoved."
158,The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback.
159,"The Communists were later pushed to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes."
160,"Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure."
161,"In the South, the American-backed dictator Syngman Rhee ran a violently anticommunist and authoritarian regime."
162,"While Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea continued to be ruled by a military government of former Japanese collaborators until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s."
163,"On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes."
164,"As part of a new campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past."
165,"On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western dignitaries at a reception in Moscow's Polish embassy, Khrushchev infamously declared, ""Whether you like it or not, history is on our side."
166,"We will bury you"", shocking everyone present."
167,"He would later say he had not been referring to nuclear war, but the historically fated victory of communism over capitalism."
168,"Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of ""massive retaliation"", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression."
169,"Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis."
170,"The latter was disturbed by the U-2 spy plane scandal, however, in which Eisenhower was caught lying to the world about the intrusion of American surveillance aircraft into Soviet territory."
171,"The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955."
172,"In response to a popular uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections."
174,"Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos."
175,"He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city."
176,"According to John Lewis Gaddis, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's ""belief in the inevitability of war,"" however."
177,"The new leader declared his ultimate goal was ""peaceful coexistence""."
178,"The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician Milovan Đilas who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that ""The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed""."
179,"He gave the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans."
180,"Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that ""Berlin is the testicles of the West."
181,"Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."""
182,NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.
183,"Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism."
184,President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks all of the Soviet Union.
185,"Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money."
186,Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response.
187,This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals.
188,"As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts."
189,"He sought, and Congress provided, a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union—he claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits."
190,"In his inaugural address Kennedy promised ""to bear any burden"" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems."
191,"From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them."
192,The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424.
193,"He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles."
194,He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.
195,"In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament."
196,"In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s."
197,Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.
199,The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951.
200,"Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was ""increasingly turning towards Communist influence."""
202,"The shah's policies included banning the communist Tudeh Party of Iran, and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK, the shah's domestic security and intelligence agency."
203,"In Guatemala, a banana republic, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz with material CIA support."
204,"After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders."
205,"In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime."
206,"They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia party."
207,"Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958."
208,The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds Padang and Manado.
209,"By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961."
210,"In the Republic of the Congo, newly independent from Belgium since June 1960, the CIA-cultivated President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September."
211,"Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues."
212,"In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north."
213,"In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War."
214,The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.
215,"Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states."
216,Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.
217,"Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge."
218,The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war.
219,"Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement."
220,"The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular."
221,"In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1."
222,The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race.
223,"This led to the Apollo Moon landings by the United States, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as ""just a battle in the Cold War."""
224,Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.
225,"Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism–Leninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support."
226,"By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc."
227,"That June, the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin."
228,"The request was rebuffed, and on 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole."
229,"Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilisation operations known as Operation Mongoose, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961."

231,"Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey."
232,"Castro later admitted that ""I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons."
233,"""The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before."
234,"Accused of rudeness and incompetence, John Lewis Gaddis argues that Krhuschev was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war and that Khrushchev had become an 'international embarrassment' when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall."
235,"Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems."
236,"During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente."
237,South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem.
238,"Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position."
239,"The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces."
240,Despite years of American tutelage and aid the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead.
241,"Tet showed that the end of US involvement was not in sight, increasing domestic skepticism of the war and giving rise to what was referred to as the Vietnam Syndrome, a public aversion to American overseas military involvements."
244,De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.
245,"De Gaulle considered the response he received to be unsatisfactory, and began the development of an independent French nuclear deterrent."
246,In 1966 he withdrew France from NATO's military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil.
247,"The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000."
248,"The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties."

255,"In Indonesia, the hardline anti-communist General Suharto wrested control of the state from his predecessor Sukarno in an attempt to establish a ""New Order""."
256,"From 1965 to 1966, with the aid of the United States and other Western governments, the military led the mass killing of more than 500,000 members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party and other leftist organizations, and detained hundreds of thousands more in prison camps around the country under extremely inhumane conditions."
257,"A top-secret CIA report stated that the massacres ""rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s."""
258,The Middle East remained a source of contention.
259,"Egypt, which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR, was a troublesome client, with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 Six-Day War (with advisers and technicians) and the War of Attrition (with pilots and aircraft) against pro-Western Israel."
260,"Despite the beginning of an Egyptian shift from a pro-Soviet to a pro-American orientation in 1972 (under Egypt's new leader Anwar Sadat), rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians' behalf during the 1973 Yom Kippur War brought about a massive American mobilization that threatened to wreck détente."
261,"Although pre-Sadat Egypt had been the largest recipient of Soviet aid in the Middle East, the Soviets were also successful in establishing close relations with communist South Yemen, as well as the nationalist governments of Algeria and Iraq."
262,Iraq signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1972.

266,"Both countries were client states of the Soviet Union; Somalia was led by self-proclaimed Marxist military leader Siad Barre, and Ethiopia was controlled by the Derg, a cabal of military generals loyal to the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had declared the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia in 1975."
267,"The Soviets initially attempted to exert a moderating influence on both states, but in November 1977 Barre broke off relations with Moscow and expelled his Soviet military advisers."
268,"He then turned to the China and Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including those of Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons."
269,"While declining to take a direct part in hostilities, the Soviet Union did provide the impetus for a successful Ethiopian counteroffensive to expel Somalia from the Ogaden."
270,"The counteroffensive was planned at the command level by Soviet advisers attached to the Ethiopian general staff, and bolstered by the delivery of millions of dollars' of sophisticated Soviet arms."
271,"About 11,000 Cuban troops spearheaded the primary effort, after receiving a hasty training on some of the newly delivered Soviet weapons systems by East German instructors."
272,"In Chile, the Socialist Party candidate Salvador Allende won the presidential election of 1970, thereby becoming the first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a country in the Americas."
273,"The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973."
274,"Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA)."
275,The Socialist states—with the exception of China and Romania—broke off relations with Chile.
276,"The Pinochet regime would go on to be one of the leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government."

278,"Independence was hastily granted to a number of Portuguese colonies, including Angola, where the disintegration of colonial rule was followed by a violent civil war."
279,"There were three rival militant factions competing for power in Angola, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA)."
280,"While all three had socialist leanings, the MPLA was the only party with close ties to the Soviet Union."
281,"Its adherence to the concept of a one-party state alienated it from the FNLA and UNITA, which began portraying themselves as anti-communist and pro-Western in orientation."
282,"When the Soviets began supplying the MPLA with arms, the CIA and China offered substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA."
283,"The MPLA eventually requested direct military support from Moscow in the form of ground troops, but the Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no combat personnel."
284,Cuba was more forthcoming and began amassing troops in Angola to assist the MPLA.
285,By November 1975 there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country.
286,"The persistent buildup of Cuban troops and Soviet weapons allowed the MPLA to secure victory and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and South African troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA."
287,"During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam used border areas of Cambodia as military bases, which Cambodian head of state Norodom Sihanouk tolerated in an attempt to preserve Cambodia's neutrality."
288,"Following Sihanouk's March 1970 deposition by pro-American general Lon Nol, who ordered the North Vietnamese to leave Cambodia, North Vietnam attempted to overrun all of Cambodia following negotiations with Nuon Chea, the second-in-command of the Cambodian communists (dubbed the Khmer Rouge) fighting to overthrow the Cambodian government."
289,Sihanouk fled to China with the establishment of the GRUNK in Beijing.
290,"American and South Vietnamese forces responded to these actions with a bombing campaign and a brief ground incursion, which contributed to the violence of the civil war that soon enveloped all of Cambodia."
291,"Martin Shaw described these atrocities as ""the purest genocide of the Cold War era."""
292,"Backed by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by Heng Samrin, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978."
293,"The invasion succeeded in deposing Pol Pot, but the new state would struggle to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere, despite the previous international outcry at the Pol Pot regime's gross human rights violations, representatives of Khmer Rouge were allowed to be seated in the UN General Assembly, with strong support from China and Western powers, the member countries of ASEAN, and it would become bogged down in a guerrilla war led from refugee camps located on the border with Thailand."
294,"Following the destruction of Khmer Rouge, the national reconstruction of Cambodia would be severely hampered, and Vietnam would suffer a punitive Chinese attack."
295,The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.
296,"In February 1972, Nixon achieved a stunning rapprochement with China, traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai."

298,"Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures."
299,"Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties, including agreements for increased trade."
300,"Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975."
301,"Kissinger and Nixon were ""realists"" who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide, because those goals were too expensive in terms of America's economic capabilities."
302,"Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace, trade and cultural exchanges."
303,"They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals, especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results."
304,"Instead Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize America's global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic, moral and political power."
305,"They rejected ""idealism"" as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism."
306,"Kissinger's realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter's moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan's rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism."
307,Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant.
308,"Diggins says, ""Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world."""
309,"Cox says, ""The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short."""
310,"Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide."
311,"The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government."
312,"Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup."
313,"Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979."
314,"A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum."
315,"Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan."
316,"He described the Soviet incursion as ""the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War""."
320,"In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere."

322,"Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an ""evil empire"" and predicted that Communism would be left on the ""ash heap of history,"" while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as ""bent on world dominance."""
323,"In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe."
324,"It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue."
325,"Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union."

327,"In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law."
328,Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response.
329,"Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy."
330,"Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years."
331,"Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges."
332,"The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base."
333,"However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West."
334,"For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet Union's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72s as the US deployed M1s."
335,"By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States."
336,"Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military."
337,"The Soviets deployed RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany."
338,"At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production."
339,"These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues."
340,"Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation."
341,"On 1 September 1983, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald, an action which Reagan characterized as a ""massacre""."
342,"The airliner had violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of Sakhalin Island near Moneron Island, and the Soviets treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding US spy plane."
343,"The incident increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev."
344,"The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts."
345,"In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua."
346,"While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy."
347,"Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, waged a fierce resistance against the invasion."
348,"The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war ""the Soviets' Vietnam""."
349,"However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system."
350,"A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a ""domestic crisis within the Soviet system."
351,"We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay""."
352,"Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment."
353,"Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions."
354,Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee.
355,"Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations."
356,"The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland."
357,"At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50 percent."
358,"A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland."
359,"Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated."
361,"The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)."
362,"The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles) and their infrastructure."
363,"During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain."
364,Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit.
365,"A year later, the two former rivals were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq (August 1990 – February 1991)."
366,"Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases."
367,The Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 finally started a movement in Hungary that the rulers in the Eastern bloc could not stop.
368,It was the largest movement of refugees from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and ultimately brought about the fall of the Iron Curtain.
369,"The patrons of the picnic, Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction."
370,"The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary to a picnic near the border at Sopron."
371,But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-interference of the Soviet Union broke the dams.
372,"Now tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer willing to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use armed force."
373,"In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders."
374,"The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising."
375,"The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style Marxist–Leninist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state."
376,The USSR was fatally weakened by a failed coup in August 1991.
377,"A growing number of Soviet republics, particularly Russia, threatened to secede from the USSR."
378,"The Commonwealth of Independent States, created on 21 December 1991, was a successor entity to the Soviet Union."
379,"Bush expressed his emotions: ""The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War."""
380,The capitalist reforms culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany.
381,Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making.
382,"After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions."
383,"After the initial desire ""to root out the reds"" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice."
384,"The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past ""old news"" for many citizens."
385,Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
386,"The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a totalitarian state to disenfranchise the ""enemies of the people"" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice."
387,"The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower."
388,"The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea)."
389,"The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science."
390,"These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War."
391,Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8 trillion.
392,"Further nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean and Vietnam Wars."
393,Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.
394,"The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia."
395,"In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure."
396,"The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media."
397,"In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked No."
398,6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.
399,"In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided."
400,"Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: ""orthodox"" accounts, ""revisionism"", and ""post-revisionism""."
401,"""Orthodox"" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe."
402,"""Revisionist"" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II."
403,"""Post-revisionists"" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War."
