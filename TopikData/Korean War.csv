0,The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following clashes along the border and insurrections in the south.
2,"After the surrender of Japan, at the end of World War II, on 15 August 1945, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation."
3,The Soviets administered the northern-half and the Americans administered the southern-half.
4,"In 1948, as a result of Cold War tensions, the occupation zones became two sovereign states."
5,A socialist state was established in the north under the totalitarian leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the authoritarian leadership of Syngman Rhee.
6,"Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent."
7,"North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950."
8,"The United Nations Security Council denounced the North Korean move as an invasion, and authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel it."
9,"These UN decisions were taken without participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, both of which supported North Korea."
10,"As a result, the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter."
11,"In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many KPA troops in South Korea."
12,Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north.
13,"UN forces invaded North Korea in October 1950 and moved rapidly towards the Yalu River—the border with China—but on 19 October 1950, Chinese forces of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war."
14,The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces and Chinese forces were in South Korea by late December.
15,"In these and subsequent battles, Seoul was captured four times, and communist forces were pushed back to positions around the 38th parallel, close to where the war started."
16,After this the front stabilized and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition.
17,"The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate."
18,North Korea was subject to a massive US bombing campaign.
19,"Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies."
20,The fighting ended on 27 July 1953 when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed.
21,"The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners."
22,"However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict."
23,"It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities, thousands of massacres by both sides, including the mass killing of tens of thousands of suspected communists by the South Korean government, and the torture and starvation of prisoners of war by the North Korean command."
24,North Korea became among the most heavily bombed countries in history.
25,"It has been sometimes referred to in the English-speaking world as ""The Forgotten War"" or ""The Unknown War"" because of the lack of public attention it received both during and after the war, relative to the global scale of World War II, which preceded it, and the subsequent angst of the Vietnam War, which succeeded it."
26,The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 in Nationalist China.
27,"It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its US-based founding president, Syngman Rhee."
28,"The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the Burma Campaign (December 1941 – August 1945)."
29,"Germany officially surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the USSR declared war on Japan on 8 August 1945, three months later."
30,This was three days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
31,This was incorporated into the US General Order No.
32,1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August.
33,"He noted that he was ""faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area""."
34,"As Rusk's comments indicate, the US doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this."
35,"Appointed as military governor, Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945–48)."
36,"He attempted to establish control by restoring Japanese colonial administrators to power, but in the face of Korean protests quickly reversed this decision."
37,Hodge did keep in governmental positions a large number of Koreans who had directly served and collaborated with the Japanese colonial government.
38,"This presence was particularly pronounced in the Korean National Police Force, who would later suppress widespread rebellions to the ROK."
39,The USAMGIK refused to recognize the provisional government of the short-lived People's Republic of Korea (PRK) due to its suspected Communist sympathies.
40,"In December 1945, Korea was administered by a US-Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, with the aim of granting independence after a five-year trusteeship."
41,The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out.
42,"To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945."
43,"Following further large-scale civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law."
44,"Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US government decided to hold an election under United Nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent Korea."
45,"The Soviet authorities and the Korean Communists refused to co-operate on the grounds it would not be fair, and many South Korean politicians boycotted it."
46,A general election was held in the South on 10 May 1948.
47,This election is generally considered to have been manipulated by the Rhee regime.
48,The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948.
49,"While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with matériel and manpower."
50,"According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese PLA during the war."
51,"As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea."
52,"Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the mid-19th century, US support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the PRC Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the US' crusade against Communism."
53,"As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the PRC leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."
54,"This was exacerbated by the ongoing undeclared border war between the Koreas, which saw division level engagements and thousands of deaths on both sides."
55,"The ROK in this time was almost entirely trained and focused in counterinsurgency, rather than conventional warfare."
56,"They were equipped and advised by a force of a few hundred American officers, who were largely successful in helping the ROKA to subdue guerrillas and hold its own against North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces along the 38th parallel."
57,"Beginning in April 1948 on the isolated island of Jeju, the campaign saw mass arrests and repression by the South Korean government in the fight against the South Korean Labor Party, resulting in a total of 30,000 violent deaths, among them 14,373 civilians (of whom ~2,000 were killed by rebels and ~12,000 by ROK security forces)."
58,"The Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion overlapped with it, as several thousand army defectors waving red flags massacred right-leaning families."
59,"This resulted in another brutal suppression by the government and between 2,976 and 3,392 deaths."
61,"Insurgency reignited in the spring of 1949, when attacks by guerrillas in the mountainous regions (buttressed by army defectors and North Korean agents) increased."
62,Insurgent activity peaked in late 1949 as the ROKA engaged so-called People's Guerrilla Units.
63,"Organized and armed by the North Korean government, and backed up by 2,400 KPA commandos who had infiltrated through the border, these guerrillas launched a large offensive in September aimed at undermining the South Korean government and preparing the country for the KPA's arrival in force."
64,This offensive failed.
65,"Serious border clashes between South and North continued on 4 August 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th Parallel."
66,"The 2nd and 18th ROK Infantry Regiments repulsed initial attacks in Kuksa-bong (above the 38th Parallel) and Ch'ungmu, and at the end of the clashes ROK troops were ""completely routed""."
67,"North Korea responded by sending more troops to link up with existing insurgents and build more partisan cadres; the number of North Korean infiltrators had reached 3,000 men in 12 units by the start of 1950, but all of these units were destroyed or scattered by the ROKA."
70,This operation crippled the insurgency.
71,"Soon after, the North Koreans made two final attempts to keep the uprising active, sending two battalion-sized units of infiltrators under the commands of Kim Sang-ho and Kim Moo-hyon."
72,The first battalion was annihilated to a man over the course of several engagements by the ROKA 8th Division.
73,"The second battalion was annihilated by a two-battalion hammer-and-anvil maneuver by units of the ROKA 6th Division, resulting in a loss toll of 584 KPA guerrillas (480 killed, 104 captured) and 69 ROKA troops killed, plus 184 wounded."
74,"By spring of 1950, guerrilla activity had mostly subsided; the border, too, was calm."
75,"However, Kim Il-sung believed that widespread uprisings had weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population."
76,"PLA forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while US forces remained stationed in South Korea."
77,"By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: PLA forces under Mao Zedong had secured final victory in China, US forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the US atomic monopoly."
78,"As the US had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance."
79,"The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation."
80,"For Kim, this was the fulfillment of his goal to unite Korea after its division by foreign powers."
81,"Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the US."
83,Mao was concerned the US would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion.
84,China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.
85,"However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border."
86,These generals completed the plans for the attack by May.
87,The original plans called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea.
88,The North Koreans would then launch a counterattack that would capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the ROK.
89,"On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture that Rhee rejected outright."
90,"On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th Parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin Peninsula."
91,Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and that South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses.
92,The ROK was being trained by the US Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG).
93,"On the eve of war, KMAG commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide ""target practice""."
94,"The Central Intelligence Agency noted the southward movement by the KPA, but assessed this as a ""defensive measure"" and concluded an invasion was ""unlikely""."
95,"On 23 June, UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent."
96,"After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the PLA were sent to North Korea."
97,"Chinese involvement was extensive from the beginning, building on previous collaboration between the Chinese and Korean communists during the Chinese Civil War."
98,"In the fall of 1949, two PLA divisions composed mainly of Korean-Chinese troops (the 164th and 166th) entered North Korea, followed by smaller units throughout the rest of 1949; these troops brought with them not only their experience and training, but their weapons and other equipment, changing little but their uniforms."
99,"The reinforcement of the KPA with PLA veterans continued into 1950, with the 156th division and several other units of the former Fourth Field Army arriving (also with their equipment) in February; the PLA 156th Division was reorganized as the KPA 7th Division."
100,"By mid-1950, between 50,000 and 70,000 former PLA troops had entered North Korea, forming a significant part of the KPA's strength on the eve of the war's beginning."
101,"Several generals, such as Lee Kwon-mu, were PLA veterans born to ethnic Koreans in China."
102,"The combat veterans and equipment from China, the tanks, artillery and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea's military superiority over the South, armed by the US military with mostly small arms, but no heavy weaponry such as tanks."
103,"While older histories of the conflict often referred to these ethnic Korean PLA veterans as being sent from northern Korea to fight in the Chinese Civil War before being sent back, recent Chinese archival sources studied by Kim Donggill indicate that this was not the case."
104,"Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft."
105,"In addition to the invasion force, the North had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea."
106,"Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their armies."
107,"In contrast, the South Korean population was estimated at 20 million and its army was unprepared and ill-equipped."
108,"As of 25 June 1950 the ROK had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the US military, but requests were denied), and a 22-plane air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT-6 advanced-trainer airplanes."
109,"Large US garrisons and air forces were in Japan, but only 200–300 US troops were in Korea."
110,"The KPA justified its assault with the claim that ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the ""bandit traitor Syngman Rhee""."
111,Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin Peninsula in the west.
112,The KPA had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery.
115,"The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing it and hundreds were killed."
116,Destroying the bridge also trapped many ROK units north of the Han River.
117,"In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day."
118,"In early July, when US forces arrived, what was left of the ROK were placed under US operational command of the United Nations Command."
119,Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson.
120,"Truman himself was at his home in Independence, Missouri."
121,Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia.
122,"At the same time, the administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved."
123,"While there was initial hesitance by some in the US government to get involved in the war, considerations about Japan played a part in the ultimate decision to engage on behalf of South Korea."
124,"Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, US experts on East Asia saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region."
125,"While there was no US policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea."
126,"""Another major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the US intervened."
127,The Truman administration was fearful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea.
129,"Yugoslavia—a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin Split—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council's post-North Korea invasion list of ""chief danger spots""."
130,"Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the UN and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere."
131,"The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans, and the US immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end."
132,The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against US forces in Korea.
133,The Truman administration now believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.
134,"The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese Republic of China and not the mainland People's Republic of China held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council."
135,"After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea."
136,On 27 June President Truman ordered US air and sea forces to help South Korea.
137,"The ROK intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war."
138,"Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response and agreed that the US was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated."
139,"Several US industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War."
141,"I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores."
142,"If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors."
143,"The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral US bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea."
144,"The United States denied Taiwan's request for combat, lest it provoke a PRC retaliation."
145,"Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to ""neutralize"" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and US initiatives as ""armed aggression on Chinese territory""."
146,"On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the KPA at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the KPA tanks."
147,"The KPA defeated the US soldiers; the result was 180 American dead, wounded, or taken prisoner."
148,"The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as US troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions."
149,"Facing a veteran and well led KPA force, and lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, the Americans retreated and the KPA advanced down the Korean Peninsula."
150,"During their advance, the KPA purged South Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals."
151,"On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung that he would be held responsible for the KPA's atrocities."
152,"By September, UN forces were hemmed into a small corner of southeast Korea, near Pusan."
153,"This 140 miles (230 km) perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River."
154,"Although Kim's early successes led him to predict he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic."
155,"To counter a possible US deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang."
156,"Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea."
157,Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon.
158,"The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic."
159,KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.
160,"To deny matériel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the US Navy air forces attacked transport hubs."
161,"Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south."
163,"Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the US mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port."
164,"By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready."
165,"In early September 1950, UN forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers."
166,"To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Incheon, near Seoul and well over 160 km (100 mi) behind the KPA lines."
167,"When authorized, he activated a combined US Army and Marine Corps, and ROK force."
168,"US X Corps, led by Major General Edward Almond, consisted of 40,000 men of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around 8,600 ROK soldiers."
169,"By 15 September, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle."
170,"However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon."
172,Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans.
173,"US air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery."
174,"KPA troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable."
175,"During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 KPA soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines."
176,"On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat."
177,On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.
178,"On 30 September, US Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: ""We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel."""
179,"During October, the South Korean police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951."
181,"On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the US that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the US crossed the 38th Parallel."
182,"Zhou attempted to advise KPA commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics that allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts KPA commanders did not use these tactics effectively."
183,MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.
184,"Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards."
185,"The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea) on 26 October, but these cities had already been captured by ROK forces."
186,The Eighth US Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang on 19 October 1950.
187,The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon.
188,"The mission was to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue US prisoners of war."
189,"At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war."
190,"As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50–100 miles (80–161 km) of mountainous terrain."
191,"In addition to the 135,000 captured, the KPA had also suffered some 200,000 men killed or wounded for a total of 335,000 casualties since the end of June 1950, and had lost 313 tanks (mostly T-34/85 models)."
192,"A mere 25,000 KPA regulars retreated across the 38th Parallel, as their military had entirely collapsed."
193,"Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border."
194,"One week later, on 7 July, Zhou and Mao chaired a conference discussing military preparations for the Korean Conflict."
195,Another conference took place on 10 July.
196,"Here it was decided that the Thirteenth Army Corps under the Fourth Field Army of the PLA, one of the best trained and equipped units in China, would be immediately transformed into the Northeastern Border Defense Army (NEBDA) to prepare for ""an intervention in the Korean War if necessary""."
197,"The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question""."
198,"Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese national security, they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea."
199,"President Truman interpreted the communication as ""a bald attempt to blackmail the UN"", and dismissed it."
200,Mao ordered that his troops should be ready for action by the end of August.
201,"At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene."
202,"In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2 to 5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea."
203,"There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the US in Korea."
204,"Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him."
205,"After Lin Biao politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment), Mao decided that Peng Dehuai would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position."
206,Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders.
207,"After Peng made the case that if US troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China, the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea."
208,"On 4 August 1950, with a planned invasion of Taiwan aborted due to the heavy US naval presence, Mao reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force."
209,"There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership, which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov."
210,"Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Air Force would need two or three months to prepare any operations."
211,"In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet Air Force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time."
212,Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.
213,"Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu."
214,"UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection."
215,"The PVA marched ""dark-to-dark"" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30."
216,"Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site."
217,"During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators."
218,"Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 460 km (286 mi) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days."
219,This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental United States.
220,"To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed."
221,"He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River."
222,"He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, ""if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter"" without air force protection."
223,"After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border."
224,This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union.
225,"Twelve days after PVA troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China."
226,"After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950."
227,"Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the US 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan."
228,"The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch'ongch'on River, while the PVA unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory."
229,It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory.
230,"The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened because of the sudden PVA withdrawal."
231,"On 24 November, the Home-by-Christmas Offensive was launched with the US Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while US X Corps attacked along the Korean east coast."
232,"But the PVA were waiting in ambush with their Second Phase Offensive, which they executed at two sectors: in the East at the Chosin Reservoir and in the Western sector at Ch'ongch'on River."
233,"On 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou Enlai the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander."
234,"On 25 November on the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then inflicted heavy losses on the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank."
235,Believing that they could not hold against the PVA the Eighth Army began to retreat from North Korea crossing the 38th Parallel in mid-December.
236,"UN morale hit rock bottom when Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident."
237,In the east on 27 November the PVA 9th Army Group initiated the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.
238,"Here the UN forces fared comparatively better: like the Eighth Army the surprise attack also forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were in the process able to breakout from the attempted encirclement by the PVA and execute a successful tactical withdrawal."
239,X Corps managed to establish a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam on 11 December and were able to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted US Eighth Army to the south.
240,"During the evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan."
241,"The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers."
242,"Before escaping, the UN forces razed most of Hungnam city, with particular attention to the port facilities."
243,"On 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national state of emergency with Presidential Proclamation No."
245,"Later, the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened."
246,"With Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the US Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive (also known as the ""Chinese New Year's Offensive"") on New Year's Eve of 1950/51."
247,"Utilizing night attacks in which UN fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy."
248,"UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south."
249,"The offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to capture Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951."
250,"Following this, the CPV party committee issued orders regarding tasks during rest and reorganization on 8 January 1951, outlining Chinese war goals."
251,"The orders read: ""the central issue is for the whole party and army to overcome difficulties … to improve tactics and skills."
252,"When the next campaign starts … we will annihilate all enemies and liberate all Korea."""
253,"In his telegram to Peng on 14 January, Mao stressed the importance of preparing for ""the last battle"" in the spring in order to ""fundamentally resolve the [Korean] issue""."
254,"These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains."
255,"The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and matériel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines."
256,"In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Thunderbolt (25 January 1951)."
257,"During the operation, the division and police conducted the Geochang massacre and Sancheong–Hamyang massacre."
258,"In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong."
259,But the offensive was soon blunted by US IX Corps at Chipyong-ni in the center.
260,The US 23rd Regimental Combat Team and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum.
261,"The battle is sometimes known as the ""Gettysburg of the Korean War"": 5,600 South Korean, US, and French troops were surrounded on all sides by 25,000 PVA."
262,"UN forces had previously retreated in the face of large PVA/KPA forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought, and won."
263,"In the last two weeks of February 1951, Operation Thunderbolt was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army."
264,"It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible."
265,"Operation Killer concluded with US I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong."
266,"On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951."
267,"Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks."
268,PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war.
269,"In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing."
270,"What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded."
271,"Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these efforts were never sufficient."
272,"At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) began participating in the war from September 1951 onward."
273,"The Fourth Phase Offensive had catastrophically failed, in contrast to the success of the Second Phase Offensive and limited gains of the Third Phase Offensive."
274,There were several reasons for the dismissal.
275,"MacArthur had crossed the 38th Parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses."
276,"He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the President's."
277,MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered.
278,"While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution."
279,"MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the US Constitution."
280,"A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo."
281,"MacArthur was relieved primarily due to his determination to expand the war into China, which other officials believed would needlessly escalate a limited war and consume too many already overstretched resources."
282,"Despite MacArthur's claims that he was restricted to fighting a limited war when China was fighting all-out, congressional testimony revealed China was using restraint as much as the US was, as they were not using air power against front-line troops, communication lines, ports, naval air forces, or staging bases in Japan, which had been crucial to the survival of UN forces in Korea."
283,"Simply fighting on the peninsula had already tied down significant portions of US airpower; as Air Force chief of staff Hoyt Vandenberg said, 80–85% the tactical capacity, one-fourth of the strategic portion, and 20% of air defense forces of the USAF were engaged in a single country."
284,There was also fear that crossing into China would provoke the Soviet Union into entering the war.
285,Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23–28 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March 1951) (a combat jump by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team) were a joint ground and airborne infiltration meant to trap PVA forces between Kaesong and Seoul.
286,"The first thrust of the offensive fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22–25 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (22–25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the No-name Line north of Seoul."
287,"Casualty ratios were grievously disproportionate; Peng had expected a 1–1 or 2-1 ratio, but instead, Chinese combat casualties from 22 to 29 April totaled between 40,000 and 60,000 compared to only 4,000 for the UN – a casualty ratio between 10–1 and 15–1."
288,"By the time Peng had called off the attack in the western sector on 29 April, the three participating armies had lost a third of their front line combat strength within a week."
290,"On 15 May 1951, the PVA commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK and US X Corps in the east at the Soyang River."
291,"370,000 PVA and 114,000 KPA troops had been mobilized for the second step of the Fifth Phase Offensive, with the bulk attacking in the eastern sector with about a quarter attempting to pin the US I Corps and IX Corps in the western sector."
292,"After initial success, they were halted by 20 May and repulsed over the following days, with western histories generally designating 22 May as the end of the offensive."
293,"At month's end, the Chinese planned the third step of the Fifth Phase Offensive (withdrawal), which they estimated would take 10 to 15 days to complete for their 340,000 remaining men, and set the retreat date for the night of 23 May."
294,"They were caught off guard when the US Eighth Army counterattacked and regained the Kansas Line on the morning of 12 May, 23 hours before the expected withdrawal."
295,"The surprise attack turned the retreat into ""the most severe loss since our forces had entered Korea""; from 16 May to 23 May, the PVA had suffered another 45,000 to 60,000 casualties before their remaining men managed to evacuate back north."
296,"During the counteroffensive, the US-led coalition captured land up to about six miles north of the 38th Parallel, with most forces stopping at the Kansas Line and a minority going further to the Wyoming Line."
297,"PVA and KPA forces suffered greatly during this offensive, especially in the Chuncheon sector and at Chiam-ni and Hwacheon; in the latter sector alone the PVA/KPA suffered over 73,207 casualties, including 8,749 captured, compared to 2,647 total casualties of the US IX Corps which engaged them."
298,The UN's Kansas Line halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.
299,"The disastrous failure of the Fifth Phase Offensive (which Peng later recalled as one of only four mistakes he made in his military career) ""led Chinese leaders to change their goal from driving the UNF out of Korea to merely defending China's security and ending the war through negotiations""."
300,"Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951 at Kaesong, an ancient capital of North Korea located in PVA/KPA held territory."
301,"On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team."
302,Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the goal of the UN forces was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.
303,"The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war."
304,"The two sides constantly traded artillery fire along the front, the American-led forces possessing a large firepower advantage over the Chinese-led forces."
305,"The communist insurgency, reinvigorated by North Korean support and scattered bands of KPA stragglers, also resurged in the south."
306,In the autumn of 1951 Van Fleet ordered Major General Paik Sun-yup to break the back of guerrilla activity.
307,"From December 1951 to March 1952, ROK security forces claimed to have killed 11,090 partisans and sympathizers and captured 9,916 more."
308,"The principal battles of the stalemate include the Battle of Bloody Ridge (18 August–15 September 1951), the Battle of the Punchbowl (31 August-21 September 1951), the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge (13 September–15 October 1951), the Battle of Old Baldy (26 June–4 August 1952), the Battle of White Horse (6–15 October 1952), the Battle of Triangle Hill (14 October–25 November 1952), the Battle of Hill Eerie (21 March–21 June 1952), the sieges of Outpost Harry (10–18 June 1953), the Battle of the Hook (28–29 May 1953), the Battle of Pork Chop Hill (23 March–16 July 1953) and the Battle of Kumsong (13–27 July 1953)."
309,"PVA troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers."
310,All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops.
311,"The situation became so serious that, in November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems."
312,"At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible."
313,These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.
314,In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities.
315,"Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future."
316,"On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort."
324,The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference.
325,"In both cases, the Chinese had some success in penetrating South Korean lines, but failed to capitalize, particularly when the US forces present responded with overwhelming firepower."
326,"Chinese casualties in their final major offensive of the war (above normal wastage for the front) were about 72,000, including 25,000 killed in action compared to 14,000 for the UN (the vast majority of these deaths were South Koreans, though 1,611 were Americans)."
327,June 1953 saw the highest monthly artillery expenditure of the war by both sides.
328,"A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation."
329,"The PVA, KPA and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans."
330,"With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA and the UN Command signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953."
331,South Korean president Syngman Rhee refused to sign the agreement.
332,"The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty."
333,"The DMZ runs northeast of the 38th Parallel; to the south, it travels west."
334,"Kaesong, site of the initial armistice negotiations, originally was in pre-war South Korea, but now is part of North Korea."
335,The DMZ has since been patrolled by the KPA and the ROK and US still operating as the UN Command.
336,"The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks."
337,"After the war, Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead."
338,"The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government."
339,"After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (The Punchbowl), on the island of Oahu, Hawaii."
340,"Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and North Korea transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct."
341,"From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals."
342,"Of these, 2,944 were identified as from the US, and all but 416 were identified by name."
343,"From 1996 to 2006, North Korea recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border."
344,"Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish Armed Forces, has been stationed near the DMZ."
345,"In April 1975, South Vietnam's capital was captured by the People's Army of Vietnam."
346,"Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to invade the South."
347,"Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to ask for military aid."
348,"Despite Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea."
349,"Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea."
350,"In 1976, the axe murder incident was widely publicized."
351,"Since 1974, four incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered."
352,"In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette ROKS Cheonan, resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors."
355,"Speaking on 4 April 2013, the US Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, informed the press that Pyongyang ""formally informed"" the Pentagon that it ""ratified"" the potential use of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the United States of America, including Guam and Hawaii."
356,They committed themselves to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
357,"Although only rough estimates of civilian fatalities are available, scholars from Guenter Lewy to Bruce Cumings have noted that the percentage of civilian casualties in Korea was higher than in World War II or the Vietnam War, with Cumings putting civilian casualties at 2 million and Lewy estimating civilian deaths in the range of 2 million to 3 million."
358,"Cumings states that civilians represent ""at least"" half of the war's casualties, while Lewy suggests that the civilian portion of the death toll ""may have gone as high as 70 percent"", compared to Lewy's estimates of 42% in World War II and 30%–46% in the Vietnam War."
359,"Compounding this devastation for Korean civilians, virtually all of the major cities on the entire Korean Peninsula were destroyed as a result of the war."
360,"The May 1953 bombing of major North Korean dams threatened several million more North Koreans with starvation, although large-scale famine was averted with emergency aid provided by North Korea's allies."
361,American combat casualties were over 90 percent of non-Korean UN losses.
362,"The first four months of the Korean War, that is, the war prior to the Chinese intervention (which started near the end of October), were by far the bloodiest per day for the US forces as they engaged and destroyed the comparatively well-equipped KPA in intense fighting."
363,"American medical records show that from July to October 1950, the US Army sustained 31 percent of the combat deaths it would ultimately accumulate in the whole 37-month war."
365,"In 2010, the Chinese government would revise their official tally of war losses to 183,108 dead (114,084 in combat, 70,000 outside of combat) and 25,621 missing."
366,"Overall, 73 percent of Chinese infantry troops served in Korea (25 of 34 armies, or 79 of 109 infantry divisions, were rotated in)."
367,"More than 52 percent of the Chinese air force, 55 percent of the tank units, 67 percent of the artillery divisions, and 100 percent of the railroad engineering divisions were sent to Korea as well."
368,Chinese soldiers who served in Korea faced a greater chance of being killed than those who served in World War II or the Chinese Civil War.
369,"This was a relatively large cost, as China had only 1/25 the national income of the United States."
370,"Spending on the Korean War constituted 34–43 percent of China's annual government budget from 1950 to 1953, depending on the year."
371,"The PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset gave a similar figure for North Korean military deaths of 316,579."
372,"Chinese sources reported similar figures for the North Korean military of 290,000 ""casualties"" and 90,000 captured."
373,"Western sources estimate the PVA suffered about 400,000 killed and 486,000 wounded, while the KPA suffered 215,000 killed and 303,000 wounded."
374,"Cumings cites a much higher figure of 900,000 fatalities among Chinese soldiers."
375,"In South Korea, some 373,500 civilians were killed, more than 225,600 wounded, and over 387,740 were listed as missing."
376,"During the first communist occupation of Seoul alone, the KPA massacred 128,936 civilians and deported another 84,523 to North Korea."
377,"On the other side of the border, some 406,000 North Korean civilians were reported to have been killed, 1,594,000 were wounded, and 680,000 were missing."
378,"Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea."
379,Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion.
380,"Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service."
381,A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls.
382,"Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn out, 'red-lined' M1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair."
383,A KPA tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion.
384,These drove against the ROK with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the T-34s.
385,Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed.
386,"The KPA tanks had a good deal of early successes against ROK infantry, Task Force Smith and the US M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered."
387,Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing KPA armor.
388,"As a result of this and the Pusan perimeter breakout the KPA had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned."
389,"By the time the KPA withdrew from the South, a total of 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns were lost."
390,"The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the eastern central zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility."
391,"Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces."
392,"A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the US Navy cruiser USS Juneau, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Jamaica and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Black Swan fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them."
393,USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present.
394,"The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Inchon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon."
395,Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea.
396,"Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea."
397,"The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces."
398,"During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea."
399,"Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to UN navy ships was from magnetic mines."
400,"During the war, five US Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug."
401,"Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 US warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage."
402,"Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury—all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater."
403,"For the initial months of the war, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor and other jets under the UN flag dominated the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) propeller-driven Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s."
404,"By early August 1950, the KPAF was reduced to only about 20 planes."
405,"The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the KPAF with the MiG-15, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters."
406,The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and therefore could reach and destroy US B-29 Superfortress bomber flights despite their fighter escorts.
407,"With increasing B-29 losses, the USAF was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets."
410,The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor.
411,"It had a very high service ceiling—15,000 m (50,000 ft) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons."
412,If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG.
413,"Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 1,100 km/h (660 mph)."
414,"Following Colonel Harrison Thyng's communication with the Pentagon, the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued."
415,"Unlike the Vietnam War, in which the Soviet Union only officially sent ""advisers"", the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps saw action in the Korean air war."
416,"Fearful of confronting the US directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian."
417,"The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's PLAAF reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost."
418,"The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention."
419,"The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively."
420,"Despite being outnumbered (the number of Sabres in theater never exceeded 150 while MiG-15s reached 900 at their peak), North Korean and Chinese aircraft were seldom encountered south of Pyongyang."
421,"UN ground forces, supply lines, and infrastructure were not attacked from the air and although North Korea had 75 airfields capable of supporting MiGs, after 1951 any serious effort to operate from them was abandoned, keeping them based across the Yalu River in the safety of China."
422,"This confined most air-to-air engagements to MiG Alley, giving UN aircraft free rein to conduct strike missions over enemy territory with little fear of interception."
423,"In 1944–1945, during the Second World War, the YR-4 helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle, helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals."
424,"As such, the medical evacuation and care system for the wound was so effective for the UN forces that a wounded soldier who arrived at a MASH unit alive typically had a 97% chance of survival."
425,"The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War (1965–75)."
426,Major bombing began in late July.
427,"The policy was the result of debates after World War II, in which US policy rejected the mass civilian bombings that had been conducted in the later stages of World War II as unproductive and immoral."
428,"He proposed that MacArthur announce that the UN would employ the firebombing methods that ""brought Japan to its knees""."
429,"My instructions are very explicit; however, I want you to know that I have no compunction whatever to your bombing bona fide military objectives, with high explosives, in those five industrial centers."
430,"If you miss your target and kill people or destroy other parts of the city, I accept that as a part of war."
431,"""In September 1950, MacArthur said in his public report to the UN, ""The problem of avoiding the killing of innocent civilians and damages to the civilian economy is continually present and given my personal attention."
432,"""In October 1950, FEAF commander General Stratemeyer requested permission to attack the city of Sinuiju, a provincial capital with an estimated population of 60,000, ""over the widest area of the city, without warning, by burning and high explosive""."
433,"MacArthur's headquarters responded the following day: ""The general policy enunciated from Washington negates such an attack unless the military situation clearly requires it."
434,Under present circumstances this is not the case.
435,"""Following the intervention of the Chinese in November, General MacArthur ordered increased bombing on North Korea which included firebombing against the country's arsenals and communications centers and especially against the ""Korean end"" of all the bridges across the Yalu River."
436,"As with the aerial bombing campaigns over Germany and Japan in World War II, the nominal objective of the USAF was to destroy North Korea's war infrastructure and shatter the country's morale."
437,"As he had done previously in July and October, MacArthur denied the request, explaining that he planned to use the town's facilities after seizing it."
438,"However, at the same meeting, MacArthur agreed for the first time to a firebombing campaign, agreeing to Stratemeyer's request to burn the city of Kanggye and several other towns: ""Burn it if you so desire."
439,"Not only that, Strat, but burn and destroy as a lesson to any other of those towns that you consider of military value to the enemy."""
440,"The same evening, MacArthur's chief of staff told Stratemeyer that the firebombing of Sinuiju had also been approved."
441,"In his diary, Stratemeyer summarized the instructions as follows: ""Every installation, facility, and village in North Korea now becomes a military and tactical target."""
442,"North Korea ranks alongside Cambodia (500,000 tons), Laos (2 million tons) and South Vietnam (4 million tons) as among the most heavily bombed countries in history, with Laos suffering the most extensive bombardment relative to its size and population."
443,Almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed as a result.
444,"North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground, and air defenses were ""non-existent""."
445,"In November 1950, the North Korean leadership instructed their population to build dugouts and mud huts and to dig tunnels, in order to solve the acute housing problem."
446,"US Air Force General Curtis LeMay commented: ""We went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea anyway, some way or another, and some in South Korea, too."""
447,"Pyongyang, which saw 75 percent of its area destroyed, was so devastated that bombing was halted as there were no longer any worthy targets."
448,"On 28 November, Bomber Command reported on the campaign's progress: 95 percent of Manpojin was destroyed, along with 90 percent of Hoeryong, Namsi and Koindong, 85 percent of Chosan, 75 percent of both Sakchu and Huichon and 20 percent of Uiju."
449,"According to USAF damage assessments, ""Eighteen of twenty-two major cities in North Korea had been at least half obliterated."""
450,"UN air forces flew 1,040,708 combat and combat support sorties during the war."
451,"These claims have been disputed; Conrad Crane asserts that while the US worked towards developing chemical and biological weapons, the US military ""possessed neither the ability, nor the will"", to use them in combat."
452,Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military.
453,"During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war."
454,"By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their cores), to remind the Soviets of US offensive ability."
455,Deployment of a similar fleet to Guam was leaked to The New York Times.
456,The PRC's propaganda against the US was stepped up.
457,"The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities."
458,"One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities."
459,"""After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee, French Premier René Pleven, and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion."
460,"The US' forgoing atomic warfare was not because of ""a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate [the Korean War]"", but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe."
461,"In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command was forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Taiwanese reinforcements, and without an increase in US forces until April 1951 (four National Guard divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea."
462,"In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command blockaded China and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Taiwanese soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea."
463,"In the third scenario: if China agreed to not cross the 38th Parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards."
464,"The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan."
465,"Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, ground crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, ""lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores""."
466,"In October 1951, the United States effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish a nuclear weapons capability."
467,"USAF B-29 bombers practiced individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east-central Japan."
468,"Hudson Harbor tested ""actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, [and] ground control of bomb aiming""."
469,An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China.
470,"The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential US use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea."
471,"Tactically, given the dispersed nature of PVA/KPA forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to mobilize and move forces."
472,"Strategically, attacking Chinese cities to destroy civilian industry and infrastructure would cause the immediate dispersion of the leadership away from such areas and give propaganda value for the communists to galvanize the support of Chinese civilians."
473,"The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, the new president feared that doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan."
474,"The war ended as it began, without US nuclear weapons deployed near battle."
475,"On 28 June, North Korean troops committed the Seoul National University Hospital massacre."
476,"On the same day, South Korean President Syngman Rhee ordered the Bodo League massacre, beginning mass killings of suspected leftist sympathizers and their families by South Korean officials and right-wing groups."
477,"Estimates of those killed during the Bodo League massacre range from at least 60,000–110,000 (Kim Dong-choon) to 200,000 (Park Myung-lim)."
478,It excavated some mass graves from the Bodo League massacres and confirmed the general outlines of those political executions.
479,"South Korean officials, after a parallel investigation, said they believed there were orders to shoot."
480,"71, 72 and 86 camps."
481,"Pro-Communist POWs experienced torture, cutting off of limbs, or were executed in public."
482,"The rebellion captured Francis Dodd, and was suppressed by the 187th Infantry Regiment."
483,"In the end, 14,235 Chinese POWs went to Taiwan and fewer than 6,000 POWs went back to mainland China."
484,"Those who went to Taiwan are called ""righteous men"" and experienced brainwashing again and were sent to the army or were arrested; while the survivors who went back to mainland China were welcomed as a ""hero"" first, but experienced anti-brainwashing, strict interrogation, and house arrest eventually, after the tattoos were discovered."
485,"After 1988, the Taiwanese government allowed POWs to go back to mainland China, and helped remove anti-communist tattoos; while the mainland Chinese government started to allow mainland Chinese prisoners of war to return from Taiwan."
486,About 43 percent of US POWs died during this period.
487,The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to logistical difficulties.
488,"The UN POWs said that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that the Chinese withheld food to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs."
489,"According to Chinese reports, over a thousand US POWs died by the end of June 1951, while a dozen British POWs died, and all Turkish POW survived."
490,"According to Hastings, wounded US POWs died for lack of medical attention and were fed a diet of corn and millet ""devoid of vegetables, almost barren of proteins, minerals, or vitamins"" with only 1/3 the calories of their usual diet."
491,"Especially in early 1951, thousands of prisoners lost the will to live and ""declined to eat the mess of sorghum and rice they were provided""."
492,"Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the KPA claimed they captured 70,000 South Koreans."
493,"However, when ceasefire negotiations began in 1951, the KPA reported they held only 8,000 South Koreans."
494,They claimed their POW rosters were small because many POWs were killed in UN air raids and that they had released ROK soldiers at the front.
495,They insisted only volunteers were allowed to serve in the KPA.
496,"By early 1952, UN negotiators gave up trying to get back the missing South Koreans."
497,"However, since 1994, South Korean POWs have been escaping North Korea on their own after decades of captivity."
498,"As of 2010, the South Korean Ministry of Unification reported that 79 ROK POWs escaped the North."
499,"They report they were not told about the POW exchange procedures, and were assigned to work in mines in the remote northeastern regions near the Chinese and Russian border."
500,"In the winter of 1951, 50,000 to 90,000 South Korean National Defense Corps soldiers starved to death while marching southward under the PVA offensive when their commanding officers embezzled funds earmarked for their food."
501,This event is called the National Defense Corps Incident.
502,There is no evidence that Syngman Rhee was personally involved in or benefited from the corruption.
503,"By the end of the war, more than 113,000 USO volunteers from the US were working at home front and abroad."
504,Many stars came to Korea to give their performances.
505,"Throughout the Korean War, ""comfort stations"" were operated by South Korean officials for UN soldiers."
506,South Korea stagnated in the first postwar decade.
509,Park Chung-hee's May 16 coup enabled social stability.
510,"From 1965 to 1973, South Korea dispatched troops to South Vietnam and received $235,560,000 in allowance and military procurement from the United States."
511,GNP increased fivefold during the Vietnam War.
512,South Korea industrialized and modernized.
513,South Korea had one of the world's fastest-growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s.
514,"After the armistice, Kim Il-Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance."
515,"Eastern European members of the Soviet Bloc also contributed with ""logistical support, technical aid, [and] medical supplies""."
516,"China canceled North Korea's war debts, provided 800 million yuan, promised trade cooperation, and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure."
517,Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped.
518,"Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the 1990s North Korean famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008."
519,"Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society."
520,International adoption of Korean children began in 1954.
521,"The US Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization of non-blacks and non-whites as US citizens, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War."
522,"Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the US was inevitable after the US entered the war, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power."
523,Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international.
524,In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War.
525,"Inside mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent."
526,"The Chinese government have encouraged the point of view that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Joseph Stalin to enter the war."
527,"In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate."
528,"These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the PLA and the Chinese Communist Party."
529,"The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day."
530,Mao had also discovered the usefulness of large-scale mass movements in the war while implementing them among most of his ruling measures over PRC.
531,"Turkey, for example, entered NATO in 1952, and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea."
