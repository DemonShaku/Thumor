0,"Colonialism is a practice or policy of control by one people or power over other people or areas, often by establishing colonies and generally with the aim of economic dominance."
1,"In the process of colonisation, colonisers may impose their religion, language, economics, and other cultural practices on indigenous peoples."
2,"The foreign administrators rule the territory in pursuit of their interests, seeking to benefit from the colonised region's people and resources."
3,"At first, European colonising countries followed policies of mercantilism, aiming to strengthen the home-country economy, so agreements usually restricted the colony to trading only with the metropole (mother country)."
4,"By the mid-19th century, however, the British Empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of free trade, with few restrictions or tariffs."
5,Christian missionaries were active in practically all of the European-controlled colonies because the metropoles were Christian.
6,"Postcolonialism and neocolonialism has continued or shifted relations and ideologies of colonialism, justifying its continuation with concepts such as development and new frontiers, as in exploring outer space for colonization."
7,"Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary defines colonialism as ""the system or policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories""."
8,"The Merriam-Webster Dictionary offers four definitions, including ""something characteristic of a colony"" and ""control by one power over a dependent area or people""."
9,"Etymologically, the word ""colony"" comes from the Latin colōnia—""a place for agriculture""."
10,"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses the term ""to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia""."
11,"It discusses the distinction between colonialism, imperialism and conquest and states that ""[t]he difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism."
14,The fundamental decisions affecting the lives of the colonised people are made and implemented by the colonial rulers in pursuit of interests that are often defined in a distant metropolis.
15,"Rejecting cultural compromises with the colonised population, the colonisers are convinced of their own superiority and their ordained mandate to rule."
16,"Settler colonialism involves large-scale immigration, often motivated by religious, political, or economic reasons."
17,It aims largely to replace any existing population.
18,"Here, a large number of people emigrate to the colony for the purpose of staying and cultivating the land."
19,"Australia, Canada, Turkey and the United States, all exemplify settler-colonial societies."
20,"Exploitation colonialism involves fewer colonists and focuses on the exploitation of natural resources or population as labour, typically to the benefit of the metropole."
21,This category includes trading posts as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration.
22,"Prior to the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and widespread abolition, when indigenous labour was unavailable, slaves were often imported to the Americas, first by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish, Dutch, French and British."
23,"Surrogate colonialism involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power, in which most of the settlers do not come from a same ethnic group as the ruling power."
24,Internal colonialism is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a state.
25,The source of exploitation comes from within the state.
26,This is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation may pass from people from the colonising country to an immigrant population within a newly independent country.
27,"National colonialism is a process involving elements of both settler and internal colonialism, in which nation-building and colonization are symbiotically connected, with the colonial regime seeking to remake the colonized peoples into their own cultural and political image."
28,"The goal is to integrate them into the state, but only as reflections of the state's preferred culture."
29,The Republic of China in Taiwan is the archetypal example of a national-colonialist society.
30,"Colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the Americas, as well as racially divided populations such as those found in French Algeria or in Southern Rhodesia."
31,"In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed."
32,"Notable examples in Asia include the Anglo-Burmese, Anglo-Indian, Burgher, Eurasian Singaporean, Filipino mestizo, Kristang and Macanese peoples."
33,"In the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia) the vast majority of ""Dutch"" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as Indo-Europeans, formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony (see also Indos in pre-colonial history and Indos in colonial history)."
34,"Phoenicians, Greeks and  Romans founded colonies in antiquity."
35,Phoenicia had an enterprising maritime trading-culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC; later the Persian empire and various Greek city-states continued on this line of setting up colonies.
36,"The  Romans would soon follow, setting up  coloniae throughout the Mediterranean, in Northern Africa, and in Western Asia."
37,"Beginning in the 7th century, Arabs colonized a substantial portion of the Middle East, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia and Europe."
38,"From the 9th century  Vikings (Norsemen) established  colonies in Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, North America, present-day Russia and Ukraine, France (Normandy) and Sicily."
39,"In the 9th century a new wave of Mediterranean colonisation began, with competitors such as the  Venetians,  Genovese and  Amalfians infiltrating the wealthy previously Byzantine or Eastern Roman islands and lands."
40,"European Crusaders set up colonial regimes in Outremer (in the Levant, 1097-1291) and in the  Baltic littoral (12th century onwards)."
41,"Venice began to dominate Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal colonial extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the  acquisition of three octaves of the Byzantine Empire."
42,Spain (initially the Crown of Castile) and soon after Portugal encountered the Americas (1492 onwards) through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land.
43,"For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of expansionism."
44,"Madrid and Lisbon  divided the areas of these ""new"" lands between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire in 1494; other would-be colonial powers paid little heed to the theoretical demarcation."
45,"The 17th century saw the birth of the French colonial empire and the Dutch Empire, as well as the English overseas possessions, which later became the British Empire."
46,"However, empire-builders established several new colonies after this time, including in the German colonial empire and the Belgian colonial empire."
47,"Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of the conquest of neighbouring territories."
48,"There was, though, some Russian colonisation of the Americas across the Bering Strait."
49,"From the 1860s, the Empire of Japan modelled itself on European colonial empires and expanded its territories in the Pacific and on the Asian mainland."
50,Argentina and the Empire of Brazil fought for hegemony in South America.
51,"The United States of America gained overseas territories after the 1898 Spanish–American War - hence the coining of the term  ""American Empire""."
54,"Nazi Germany set up short-lived colonial systems (Reichskommissariate,  Generalgouvernement) in Eastern Europe in the early 1940s."
57,"These included significant wars of independence fought in  Indonesia,  Vietnam,  Algeria, and  Kenya."
58,"Eventually, the European powers—pressured by the United States and Soviets—resigned themselves to decolonisation."
59,"In 1962 the United Nations set up a Special Committee on Decolonisation, often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process."
61,"Outside Europe, few areas had remained without coming under formal colonial tutorship - and even Siam,  China, Nepal, Japan, Afghanistan, Persia and  Abyssinia had felt varying degrees of Western colonial-style influence -  concessions,  unequal treaties, extraterritoriality and the like."
63,"He reports that in every case the support cost, especially the military system necessary to support and defend colonies, outran the total trade they produced."
64,"Apart from the British Empire, they did not provide favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus metropole populations."
65,"The question of whether colonies paid is, however, a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved."
66,In some cases colonial powers paid a lot in military costs while private investors pocketed the benefits.
67,In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes.
68,Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation - rather to colonialism or colonial-style exploitation by other means.
69,"Various effects, both immediate and protracted, include the spread of virulent diseases, unequal social relations, detribalization, exploitation, enslavement, medical advances, the creation of new institutions, abolitionism, improved infrastructure, and technological progress."
70,"Colonial practices also spur the spread of colonist languages, literature and cultural institutions, while endangering or obliterating those of native peoples."
71,The native cultures of the colonised peoples can also have a powerful influence on the imperial country.
72,Greek trade networks spread throughout the Mediterranean region while Roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonised areas towards the Roman metropole.
73,"According to Strabo, by the time of emperor Augustus, up to 120 Roman ships would set sail every year from Myos Hormos in Roman Egypt to India."
75,"Aztec civilisation developed into an extensive empire that, much like the Roman Empire, had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas."
76,"Despite the general trend of economic expansion, the economic performance of former European colonies varies significantly."
77,"At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions – especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated."
78,"To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions."
79,"For example, one interesting observation is ""the Reversal of Fortune"" – the less developed civilisations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas."
80,One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area.
81,"Therefore, given a more developed civilisation and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests."
82,"In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control."
83,"For example, in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights."
84,"While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village's food supply or their individual family's land."
85,"However, when working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers."
86,"Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men."
87,"In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level."
88,Exploitation of non-Europeans and of other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers.
89,Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were the extension of slavery and indentured servitude.
90,"Spain and Portugal had brought African slaves to work in African colonies such as Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, and then in Latin America, by the 16th century."
91,"The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries."
92,The European colonial system took approximately 11 million Africans to the Caribbean and to North and South America as slaves.
93,"Abolitionists in Europe and Americas protested the inhumane treatment of African slaves, which led to the elimination of the slave trade (and later, of most forms of slavery) by the late 19th century."
94,"One (disputed) school of thought points to the role of abolitionism in the American Revolution: while the British colonial metropole started to move towards outlawing slavery, slave-owning elites in the Thirteen Colonies saw this as one of the reasons to fight for their post-colonial independence and for the right to develop and continue a largely slave-based economy."
95,British colonising activity in New Zealand from the early 19th century played a part in ending slave-taking and slave-keeping among the indigenous Māori.
96,Indentured servants consented to a contract with the European colonisers.
97,"Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well."
98,"The employees became ""indentured"" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages."
99,"In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts imposed by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony."
100,India and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era.
101,"Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies."
102,"Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India."
103,"By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery persists in Africa and in the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition."
104,"Greeks developed the phalanx system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield."
105,"Under Philip II of Macedon, they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments."
106,Alexander the Great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.
107,"The Spanish Empire held a major advantage over Mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the Aztec civilisation and others."
108,The use of gunpowder weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.
109,"Francophone residents of Quebec, for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the Conscription crisis of 1917."
110,Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population.
111,"Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's Sepoy Rebellion of 1857."
112,"The territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another."
113,"European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control."
114,Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators.
115,These events also caused much bloodshed at the time of the migration of immigrants from the two countries.
116,Muslims from India and Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan migrated to the respective countries they sought independence to.
117,"In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace."
118,"900,000 French colonists (known as the Pied-Noirs) resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962."
119,A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent.
120,Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation.
121,"For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous, or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies."
122,"In some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies."
123,"The Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members."
124,"A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France, the Francophonie; the Community of Portuguese Language Countries plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the Dutch Language Union is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands."
125,"Migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies."
126,"Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the Maghreb countries of north Africa and the majority population of France."
127,"Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of ""inner Paris"" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian."
128,"Smallpox also ravaged Mexico in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in Tenochtitlan alone, including the emperor, and Peru in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors."
129,Measles killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century.
130,"In 1618–1619, smallpox wiped out 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans."
132,Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases.
135,"Introduced diseases, notably smallpox, nearly wiped out the native population of Easter Island."
137,"The findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home, where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of Europe."
138,The disease was more frequently fatal than it is today; syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance.
139,"The first cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820."
140,Ten thousand British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic.
142,"Waldemar Haffkine, who mainly worked in India, who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the 1890s, is considered the first microbiologist."
143,"By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans."
144,Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in India.
146,The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk.
148,"Notable examples of these plants included sugar, nutmeg, tobacco, cloves, cinnamon, Peruvian bark, peppers and tea."
149,"This work was a large part of securing financing for colonial ambitions, supporting European expansion and ensuring the profitability of such endeavors."
150,"Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus were seeking to establish routes to trade spices, dyes and silk from the Moluccas, India and China by sea that would be independent of the established routes controlled by Venetian and Middle Eastern merchants."
151,"Naturalists like Hendrik van Rheede, Georg Eberhard Rumphius, and Jacobus Bontius compiled data about eastern plants on behalf of the Europeans."
152,"Though Sweden did not possess an extensive colonial network, botanical research based on Carl Linnaeus identified and developed techniques to grow cinnamon, tea and rice locally as an alternative to costly imports."
153,"From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol."
154,"The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies."
155,"The empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by Alexander the Great, spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies."
156,"While most Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others (the word barbarian is derived from mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like ""bar-bar""), Alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the Persians."
157,He adopted Persian customs of clothing and otherwise encouraged his men to go native by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms.
158,"Of note is that he radically departed from earlier Greek attempts at colonisation, characterised by the murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants and the settling of Greek citizens from the polis."
159,Roman universalism was characterised by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law.
160,Roman law was imposed on both Roman citizens and colonial subjects.
161,"Although Imperial Rome had no public education, Latin spread through its use in government and trade."
162,"Roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves, which was responsible for the 200 year long Pax Romana, at the time the longest period of peace in history."
163,"The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, even allowing them on a few occasions to threaten Roman authority."
164,"While the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious, geographical tools such as cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in European colonial expansion."
165,"Historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimised colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped, which created notions of skewed evolution."
166,"Geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism; more specifically, the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism."
167,"Maps played an extensive role in colonialism, as Bassett would put it ""by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardised format, cartographers helped open West Africa to European conquest, commerce, and colonisation""."
168,"However, because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective, cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era."
169,Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps.
170,During colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art.
171,The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate.
172,"Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the centre of the map."
173,"""A common practice by the European cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as ""blank spaces""."
174,This influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonise these regions.
175,Imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries.
176,"The Dictionary of Human Geography notes that cartography was used to empty 'undiscovered' lands of their Indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of ""Western place-names and borders, [therefore] priming 'virgin' (putatively empty land, 'wilderness') for colonisation (thus sexualising colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration), reconfiguring alien space as absolute, quantifiable and separable (as property)."
177,"""David Livingstone stresses ""that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places"" and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries."
178,"Geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science, Painter and Jeffrey argue, rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world."
179,"Comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture, finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography."
180,"Colonialism is based on an imperial outlook, thereby creating a consequential relationship."
181,"Through an empire, colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded, on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire."
182,In the next section Marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship.
183,"Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development."
184,"It is an ""instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency""."
185,Colonies are constructed into modes of production.
186,The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation.
187,"Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation."""
188,"Non Russian marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, meanwhile, between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism."
190,"Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups."
191,That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism.
192,Colonialism went much further than trade.
193,It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa.
194,"Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society."
195,"From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources."
196,It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped.
197,"""Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector."
198,"As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place."
199,"""According to Lenin, the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital."
200,"He states it is, ""connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world""."
201,"As free trade thrives on exports of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry."
202,"This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism."
203,He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing.
204,War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism.
205,"Uzoigwe states, ""But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses."""
207,"Their philosophies found the colonial enterprise, particularly mercantilism, in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies."
208,"Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average, although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out."
209,"Colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the ""mother-countries"" themselves."
210,"Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused on the study of colonised indigenous women, as in the case of Georges Cuvier's study of Sarah Baartman."
211,Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists' from the mother-countries.
212,"Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was, on the average, slightly smaller than that of the male, thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males."
213,"Such seemingly flawed studies of race and gender coincided with the era of colonialism and the initial introduction of foreign cultures, appearances, and gender roles into the now gradually widening world-views of the scholars of the mother-countries."
214,"Othering is the creation of those who discriminate, to distinguish, label, categorise those who do not fit in the societal norm."
215,"Several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the ""other"" as an epistemological concept in social theory."
216,"""othered"" places they wanted to dominate to legalise their exploitation of the land."
217,"During and after the rise of colonialism the Western powers perceived the East as the ""other"", being different and separate from their societal norm."
218,"This viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the Eastern and Western culture creating a dominant/subordinate dynamic, both being the ""other"" towards themselves."
219,"In this sense, one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires."
221,"Saïd analyzed the works of Balzac, Baudelaire and Lautréamont, arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority."
222,"Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse, but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story."
227,"In explaining his position, he says ""I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilisations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever its own particular genius may be, a civilisation that withdraws into itself atrophies; that for civilisations, exchange is oxygen."""
228,"However, he contends that colonisation is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighbouring civilisations."
229,"To illustrate his point, he explains that colonisation relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanise the targets of colonisation and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment."
230,"Every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonisers onto the colonised is justified by racist, sexist, otherwise xenophobic, or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people, the colonising civilisation ""acquires another dead weight, a universal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a centre of infection begins to spread."""
