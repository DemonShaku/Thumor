2,"On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council."
3,"An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II."
4,"Most of the coalition's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order."
5,This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February.
6,"This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory."
7,The coalition ceased its advance and declared a ceasefire 100 hours after the ground campaign started.
8,"Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border."
9,Iraq launched Scud missiles against Israel and coalition targets in Saudi Arabia.
10,The US was concerned with Iraq's position on Israeli–Palestinian politics.
11,"The US also disliked Iraqi support for many Arab and Palestinian militant groups such as Abu Nidal, which led to Iraq's inclusion on the developing US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism on 29 December 1979."
14,"In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism."
15,The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.
16,"""With Iraq's newfound success in the war, and the Iranian rebuff of a peace offer in July, arms sales to Iraq reached a record spike in 1982."
17,"When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US's request in November 1983, the Reagan administration sent Donald Rumsfeld to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties."
18,"By the time the ceasefire with Iran was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising."
19,Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
21,"Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts, but they refused."
22,The Iraq–Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwaiti territory.
23,"Kuwait had been a part of the Ottoman Empire's province of Basra, something that Iraq claimed made Kuwait rightful Iraqi territory."
24,"Kuwait's ruling dynasty, the al-Sabah family, had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for Kuwait's foreign affairs to the United Kingdom."
27,The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran–Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal.
29,"Resulting revenues struggled to support the government's basic costs, let alone repair Iraq's damaged infrastructure."
30,"Jordan and Iraq both looked for more discipline, with little success."
31,"The Iraqi government described it as a form of economic warfare, which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait slant-drilling across the border into Iraq's Rumaila oil field."
32,"At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war."
33,"A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq Umm Qasr was rejected."
34,"Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq's large debts, even with the demobilization of 200,000 soldiers."
35,These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events directly related to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.
36,"However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq's human rights record, including the well-known use of torture."
37,"The UK also condemned the execution of Farzad Bazoft, a journalist working for the British newspaper The Observer."
38,"Following Saddam's declaration that ""binary chemical weapons"" would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding."
39,"On the 23rd, the CIA reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert."
40,"Saddam believed an anti-Iraq conspiracy was developing – Kuwait had begun talks with Iran, and Iraq's rival Syria had arranged a visit to Egypt."
41,"Upon review by the Secretary of Defense, it was found that Syria indeed planned a strike against Iraq in the coming days."
42,Saddam immediately used funding to incorporate central intelligence into Syria and ultimately prevented the impending air strike.
45,The US sent aerial refuelling planes and combat ships to the Persian Gulf in response to these threats.
55,We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country.
56,"Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south."
57,Normally that would not be any of our business.
58,"But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the UAE and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned."
59,"Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq ""would not accept death."
60,Glaspie similarly believed that war was not imminent.
61,"The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion, which started on 2 August 1990 with the bombing of Kuwait's capital, Kuwait City."
62,"Before the invasion, the Kuwaiti military was believed to have numbered 16,000 men, arranged into three armored, one mechanised infantry and one under-strength artillery brigade."
63,"The pre-war strength of the Kuwait Air Force was around 2,200 Kuwaiti personnel, with 80 fixed-wing aircraft and 40 helicopters."
64,"In spite of Iraqi saber rattling, Kuwait did not mobilize its force; the army had been stood-down on 19 July, and during the Iraqi invasion many Kuwaiti military personnel were on leave."
65,"By 1988, at the end of the Iran–Iraq war, the Iraqi Army was the world's fourth largest army, consisting of 955,000 standing soldiers and 650,000 paramilitary forces in the Popular Army."
66,"According to John Childs and André Corvisier, a low estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding 4,500 tanks, 484 combat aircraft and 232 combat helicopters."
67,"The Iraqi attack had two prongs, with the primary attack force driving south straight for Kuwait City down the main highway, and a supporting attack force entering Kuwait farther west, but then turning and driving east, cutting off Kuwait City from the country's southern half."
68,A few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces.
69,"The main Iraqi thrust into Kuwait City was conducted by commandos deployed by helicopters and boats to attack the city from the sea, while other divisions seized the airports and two airbases."
70,"The Iraqis attacked the Dasman Palace, the Royal Residence of Kuwait's Emir, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, which was defended by the Emiri Guard supported with M-84 tanks."
71,"In the process, the Iraqis killed Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir's youngest brother."
72,"Within 12 hours, most resistance had ended within Kuwait, and the royal family had fled, allowing Iraq to control most of Kuwait."
73,"After two days of intense combat, most of the Kuwaiti military were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard, or had escaped to Saudi Arabia."
74,The Emir and key ministers fled south along the highway for refuge in Saudi Arabia.
75,"Iraqi ground forces consolidated their control of Kuwait City, then headed south and redeployed along the Saudi border."
76,"After the decisive Iraqi victory, Saddam initially installed a puppet regime known as the ""Provisional Government of Free Kuwait"" before installing his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid as Kuwait's governor on 8 August."
77,"After the invasion, the Iraqi military looted over $1,000,000,000 in banknotes from Kuwait's Central Bank."
78,"At the same time, Saddam Hussein made the Kuwaiti dinar equal to the Iraqi dinar, thereby lowering the Kuwaiti currency to one-twelfth of its original value."
79,"In response, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah ruled the banknotes as invalid and refused to reimburse stolen notes, which became worthless because of a UN embargo."
80,"After the conflict ended, many of the stolen banknotes made their way back into circulation."
81,"Today, the stolen banknotes are a collectible for numismatists."
82,The Kuwaiti resistance's casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages.
83,The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision.
84,"The Iran–Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and both sides sustained significant casualties, reaching into the hundreds of thousands."
85,Within President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents.
86,"A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George Bush, to review US options."
87,"It was determined that the conflict would likely spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region."
88,"Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum."
89,"On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study."
90,"(The full declassified presentation can be seen here:) The conclusions were threefold: first, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early if the oil market was disrupted; second, the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and third, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq."
91,"The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the London Summit of 1984."
92,The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
93,"Within hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which passed Resolution 660, condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops."
94,"On 3 August 1990, the Arab League passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the league, and warned against outside intervention."
95,Iraq and Libya were the only two Arab League states that opposed the resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait; the PLO opposed it as well.
96,The Arab states of Yemen and Jordan – a Western ally which bordered Iraq and relied on the country for economic support – opposed military intervention from non-Arab states.
97,"Resolution 665 followed soon after, which authorized a naval blockade to enforce the sanctions."
98,"Specifically, he called for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and ""mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait."""
99,"He also called for a replacement of US troops that mobilized in Saudi Arabia in response to Kuwait's invasion with ""an Arab force"", as long as that force did not involve Egypt."
100,"Additionally, he requested an ""immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions"" and a general normalization of relations with Iraq."
101,"In the video, he asks a young British boy, Stuart Lockwood, whether he is getting his milk, and goes on to say, through his interpreter, ""We hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long."
102,"Your presence here, and in other places, is meant to prevent the scourge of war."
103,"""Another Iraqi proposal communicated in August 1990 was delivered to US National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft by an unidentified Iraqi official."
104,"The official communicated to the White House that Iraq would ""withdraw from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave"" provided that the UN lifted sanctions, allowed ""guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf through the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah"", and allowed Iraq to ""gain full control of the Rumaila oil field that extends slightly into Kuwaiti territory""."
105,"The proposal also ""include[d] offers to negotiate an oil agreement with the United States 'satisfactory to both nations' national security interests,' develop a joint plan 'to alleviate Iraq's economical and financial problems' and 'jointly work on the stability of the gulf."
106,"'""On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678, which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, and empowered states to use ""all necessary means"" to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline."
107,"In December 1990, Iraq made a proposal to withdraw from Kuwait provided that foreign troops left the region and that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel's and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."
108,The White House rejected the proposal.
109,"The French proposal was supported by Belgium (at the moment one of the rotating Council members), Germany, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and several non-aligned nations."
110,"The US, the UK, and the Soviet Union rejected it; US Ambassador to the UN Thomas Pickering stated that the French proposal was unacceptable, because it went beyond previous Council resolutions on the Iraqi invasion."
111,"France dropped this proposal when it found ""no tangible sign of interest"" from Baghdad."
112,"Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy striking distance of Saudi oil fields."
113,"Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world's oil reserves."
114,Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia.
115,The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran.
116,"The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran's Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority."
117,"After the war, Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran."
118,"Soon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis."
119,He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.
120,He combined the language of the Islamist groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.
122,The US also sent the battleships USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin to the region.
127,"Two Air National Guard units were stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping four million pounds (1,800,000 kilograms; 1,800 metric tons) of munitions, and the New York Air National Guard's 174th Fighter Wing from Syracuse flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions."
128,"Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq."
129,"Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via fast sealift ships, allowing a quick buildup."
130,"The first stop was Saudi Arabia, which a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities."
131,"However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia should assume some of the cost of the military efforts to defend it."
132,"Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered ""the moderate voice of the Middle East""."
133,"President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention."
134,"Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that ""Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years."""
135,"Harboring this animosity and impressed with Baker's diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort."
136,This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition.
137,"In exchange, Washington gave Syrian dictator President Hafez al-Assad the green light to wipe out forces opposing Syria's rule in Lebanon and arranged for weapons valued at a billion dollars to be provided to Syria, mostly through Gulf states."
138,"In exchange for Iran's support for the US-led intervention, the US government promised the Iranian government to end US opposition to World Bank loans to Iran."
139,"Although Germany's constitution (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement in outside nations, Kohl committed a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition's war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the transportation of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf."
140,"A coalition of forces opposing Iraq's aggression was formed, consisting of forces from 39 countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States."
141,It was the largest coalition since World War II.
142,Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair or did not want to increase US influence in the Middle East.
143,"In the end, however, many nations were persuaded by Iraq's belligerence towards other Arab states, offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness, and threats to withhold aid."
144,"In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance."
145,"Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance."
146,"During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, US President George Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: ""Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia."
147,It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.
148,"""The Pentagon stated that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were this information's source, but this was later alleged to be false."
149,"Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons, which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq War and against his own country's Kurdish population in the Al-Anfal campaign."
150,"Iraq was also known to have a nuclear weapons program, but the report about it from January 1991 was partially declassified by the CIA on 26 May 2001."
151,"Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the US."
152,The Senate supported the military actions in a 52–47 vote.
153,"However, a year after the war, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication."
154,The young woman who had testified was found to be a member of Kuwait's Royal Family and the daughter of Kuwait's ambassador to the US.
155,She hadn't lived in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion.
156,"This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony."
157,"After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction."
158,President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.
159,"In reality, the Iraqi Army did commit various well-documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait, such as the summary execution without trial of three brothers, after which their bodies were stacked and left to decay in a public street."
160,Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes; one residence was repeatedly defecated in.
161,"For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history."
163,"The air campaign was commanded by USAF Lieutenant General Chuck Horner, who briefly served as US Central Command's Commander-in-Chief – Forward while General Schwarzkopf was still in the US."
165,The priority was the destruction of Iraq's Air Force and anti-aircraft facilities.
166,The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six carrier battle groups (CVBG) in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.
167,The next targets were command and communication facilities.
168,"Saddam Hussein had closely micromanaged Iraqi forces in the Iran–Iraq War, and initiative at lower levels was discouraged."
169,Coalition planners hoped that Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control.
170,"The air campaign's third and largest phase targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait: Scud missile launchers, weapons research facilities, and naval forces."
171,"About a third of the coalition's air power was devoted to attacking Scuds, some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate."
172,US and British special operations forces had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search for and destruction of Scuds.
173,"Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including man-portable air-defense systems, were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft, and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action."
174,Two of these losses are the result of aircraft colliding with the ground while evading Iraqi ground-fired weapons.
175,One of these losses is a confirmed air-air victory.
177,"""Five hours after the first attacks, Iraq's state radio broadcast declared that ""The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins."""
178,Iraq fired eight missiles the next day.
179,These missile attacks were to continue throughout the war.
180,Iraq fired 88 Scud missiles during the war's seven weeks.
181,Iraq hoped to provoke a military response from Israel.
182,"The Iraqi government hoped that many Arab states would withdraw from the Coalition, as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel."
183,"Following the first attacks, Israeli Air Force jets were deployed to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq."
184,"Israel prepared to militarily retaliate, as its policy for the previous 40 years had always been retaliation."
185,"However, President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets, fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq, the other Arab nations would either desert the coalition or join Iraq."
186,"It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq, they would intervene in the war on Iraq's side or attack Israel."
187,"According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Iraqi attacks killed 74 Israelis: two directly and the rest from suffocation and heart attacks."
188,Approximately 230 Israelis were injured.
189,"Extensive property damage was also caused, and, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""Damage to general property consisted of 1,302 houses, 6,142 apartments, 23 public buildings, 200 shops and 50 cars."""
190,It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents such as sarin.
191,"As a result, Israel's government issued gas masks to its citizens."
192,"When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas."
193,"It has been suggested that the sturdy construction techniques used in Israeli cities, coupled with the fact that Scuds were only launched at night, played an important role in limiting the number of casualties from Scud attacks."
194,"In response to the threat of Scuds on Israel, the US rapidly sent a Patriot missile air defense artillery battalion to Israel along with two batteries of MIM-104 Patriot missiles for the protection of civilians."
195,The Royal Netherlands Air Force also deployed a Patriot missile squadron to Israel and Turkey.
196,"The Dutch Defense Ministry later stated that the military use of the Patriot missile system was largely ineffective, but its psychological value for the affected populations was high."
197,"Coalition air forces were also extensively exercised in ""Scud hunts"" in the Iraqi desert, trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia."
198,"On the ground, special operations forces also infiltrated Iraq, tasked with locating and destroying Scuds - including the ill-fated Bravo Two Zero patrol of the SAS."
199,"Once special operations were combined with air patrols, the number of attacks fell sharply, then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to coalition tactics."
200,"As the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew increasingly impatient, and considered taking unilateral military action against Iraq."
201,"On 22 January 1991, a Scud missile hit the Israeli city of Ramat Gan, after two coalition Patriots failed to intercept it."
202,"Three elderly people suffered fatal heart attacks, another 96 people were injured, and 20 apartment buildings were damaged."
203,"After this attack, the Israelis warned that if the US failed to stop the attacks, they would."
204,The missiles were fired at both military and civilian targets.
205,"One Saudi civilian was killed, and 78 others were injured."
206,No casualties were reported in Bahrain or Qatar.
207,The Saudi government issued all its citizens and expatriates with gas masks in the event of Iraq using missiles with chemical or biological warheads.
208,The government broadcast alerts and 'all clear' messages over television to warn citizens during Scud attacks.
210,"The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard, supported by Qatari forces and US Marines."
211,The allied forces used extensive artillery fire.
212,"Both sides suffered casualties, although Iraqi forces sustained substantially more dead and captured than the allied forces."
213,"Eleven Americans were killed in two separate friendly fire incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their AC-130 gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle."
214,Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead.
216,The Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces.
218,Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day.
220,"Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town."
221,"One Iraqi soldier, who had fought in the Iran–Iraq War, remarked that his brigade ""had sustained more punishment from allied airpower in 30 minutes at Khafji than in eight years of fighting against Iran."""
222,"It was the spearhead of VII Corps, consisting primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment."
223,"Task Force 1–41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and to conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991."
224,Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1–41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission.
225,"1–41 Infantry was assisted by the 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment."
226,This joint effort would become known as Task Force Iron.
227,Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces.
228,On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector observing American forces.
229,On 16 February 1991 several groups of Iraqi vehicles appeared to be performing reconnaissance on the Task Force and were driven away by fire from 4–3 FA.
230,"Another enemy platoon, including six vehicles, was reported as being to the northeast of the Task Force."
232,Later that evening another group of Iraqi vehicles was spotted moving towards the center of the Task Force.
233,They appeared to be Iraqi Soviet-made BTRs and tanks.
234,For the next hour the Task Force fought several small battles with Iraqi reconnaissance units.
238,Later that evening the Task Force received enemy artillery fire but suffered no casualties.
239,"Prior to this action the Task Force's primary fire support battalion, 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, participated in a massive artillery preparation."
240,Around 300 guns from multiple nations participated in the artillery barrage.
241,"Over 14,000 rounds were fired during these missions."
242,"M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems contributed an additional 4,900 rockets fired at Iraqi targets."
243,One Iraqi unit that was totally destroyed during the preparation was the Iraqi 48th Infantry Division Artillery Group.
245,This artillery prep was supplemented by air attacks by B-52 bombers and Lockheed AC-130 fixed wing gunships.
247,"One artillery mission struck a series of Iraqi bunkers, reinforced by Iraqi T-55 tanks, in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division."
248,"The same day the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division with the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor, and the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry destroyed Iraqi bunkers and combat vehicles in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division."
249,"On 24 February 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division rolled through the breach in the Iraqi defense west of Wadi Al-Batin and also cleared the northeastern sector of the breach site of enemy resistance."
251,Also on 24 February the 1st Infantry Division along with the 1st Cavalry Division destroyed Iraqi outposts and patrols belonging to the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division.
252,The two divisions also began capturing prisoners.
253,The 1st Infantry Division cleared a zone between Phase Line Vermont and Phase Line Kansas.
254,"The 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment handled similar responsibilities in its sector of operations."
255,"The 1st Infantry Division's 5th Battalion, 16th Infantry also played a significant role clearing the trenches and captured 160 Iraqi soldiers in the process."
256,Once into Iraqi territory Task Force 1-41 Infantry encountered multiple Iraqi defensive positions and bunkers.
257,These defensive positions were occupied by a brigade-sized element.
258,Task Force 1-41 Infantry elements dismounted and prepared to engage the enemy soldiers who occupied these well-prepared and heavily fortified bunkers.
259,The Task Force found itself engaged in six hours of combat in order to clear the extensive bunker complex.
260,"The Iraqis engaged the Task Force with small arms fire, RPGs, mortar fire, and what was left of Iraqi artillery assets."
261,A series of battles unfolded resulting in heavy Iraqi casualties and the Iraqis being removed from their defensive positions with many becoming prisoners of war.
262,Some escaped to be killed or captured by other coalition forces.
263,"In the process of clearing the bunkers, Task Force 1-41 captured two brigade command posts and the command post of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division."
264,"The Task Force also captured a brigade commander, several battalion commanders, company commanders, and staff officers."
267,"The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historic significance."
268,Some consider the battle of Medina Ridge the largest tank battle of the war.
269,The US Marine Corps also fought the biggest tank battle in its history at Kuwait International Airport.
270,The US 3rd Armored Division also fought a significant battle at Objective Dorset not far from where the battle of Norfolk was taking place.
271,The US 3rd Armored Division destroyed approximately 300 enemy combat vehicles during this particular encounter with Iraqi forces.
272,"The Iraqis suffered the loss of over 3,000 tanks and over 2,000 other combat vehicles during these battles against the American-led coalition."
273,"For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks."
274,"On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City."
275,"They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields."
276,"However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours."
277,"Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered."
278,The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering.
279,"However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft."
280,"It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait 15 hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard."
281,"The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance."
282,"Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself."
283,Iraqi troops offered only light resistance.
284,The Kuwaitis quickly liberated the city despite losing one soldier and having one plane shot down.
285,"On 27 February, Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait, and President Bush declared it liberated."
286,"However, an Iraqi unit at Kuwait International Airport appeared not to have received the message and fiercely resisted."
287,"US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure."
288,"After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait."
289,"As part of a scorched earth policy, they set fire to nearly 700 oil wells and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult."
290,"The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service's B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January."
291,"These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day."
292,Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators launching attacks against Israel.
293,The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention.
294,"Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria."
295,"Elements of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army performed a direct attack into Iraq on 15 February 1991, followed by one in force on 20 February that led directly through seven Iraqi divisions which were caught off guard."
298,"It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south."
299,"The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al-Batin."
300,"Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis."
301,This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west.
302,"On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement."
303,"The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council."
304,"The coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave 24 hours for Iraq to withdraw its forces."
307,"Iraqi resistance was light, and four Americans were killed."
308,"Simultaneously, the US XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping ""left-hook"" attack across southern Iraq's largely undefended desert, led by the US 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized)."
309,This movement's left flank was protected by the French Division Daguet.
310,The 101st Airborne Division conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory.
311,The 101st Airborne Division had struck 249 km (155 mi) behind enemy lines.
312,It was the deepest air assault operation in history.
313,"Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces."
314,The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further 80 to 100 km (50 to 60 mi) into Iraq.
315,"By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces."
316,The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war.
317,"The French force quickly overcame Iraq's 45th Infantry Division, suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners, and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counterattack on the coalition's flank."
318,The movement's right flank was protected by the United Kingdom's 1st Armoured Division.
319,"Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape."
320,"The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges."
321,"Unlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender."
322,"The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out."
323,"Coalition forces pressed another 10 km into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours."
325,"A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and 30 wounded during the battle."
326,"Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq's Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base."
327,"In nearly two days of some of the war's most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander."
328,"Meanwhile, US forces attacked the village of Al Busayyah, meeting fierce resistance."
329,"The US force destroyed military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties."
333,"Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the Highway of Death."
334,Thousands of Iraqi troops were killed.
335,"At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure."
336,"Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an uprising in the south."
337,"The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of ""The Voice of Free Iraq"" on 2 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia."
338,"However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the Kurdish uprising."
339,Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran.
340,These events later resulted in no-fly zones being established in northern and southern Iraq.
341,"In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed."
346,We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.
347,And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties.
348,"I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war."
349,"And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam [Hussein] worth?"
350,"And the answer is, not that damned many."
351,"So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq."
352,Kuwaiti democracy advocates had been calling for restoration of Parliament that the Emir had suspended in 1986.
353,This later became known as checkbook diplomacy.
354,"In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US hospital ship, and a naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait's port facilities following the end of combat operations."
355,Australian forces experienced a number of incidents in the first number of weeks of the Desert Storm Campaign including the detection of significant air threats from Iraq as a part of the outer perimeter of Battle Force Zulu; the detection of free sea floating mines and assistance to the aircraft carrier USS Midway.
356,"The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS Brisbane narrowly avoiding a mine."
357,The Australians played a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait's invasion.
358,"Following the war's end, Australia deployed a medical unit on Operation Habitat to northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort."
359,"In August 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed the Canadian Forces to deploy a Naval Task Group."
360,The destroyers HMCS Terra Nova and HMCS Athabaskan joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship HMCS Protecteur in Operation Friction.
361,The Canadian Task Group led the coalition's maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf.
362,"A fourth ship, HMCS Huron, arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait."
363,"Following the UN-authorized use of force against Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a CF-18 Hornet and CH-124 Sea King squadron with support personnel, as well as a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war."
364,"When the air war began, the CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and were tasked with providing air cover and attacking ground targets."
365,This was the first time since the Korean War that Canada's military had participated in offensive combat operations.
366,"Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the French Army force was the Division Daguet, including troops from the French Foreign Legion."
367,"Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via CENTCOM) and Saudis."
368,"In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps."
369,France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units.
371,Operation Granby was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf.
372,"British Army regiments (mainly with the 1st Armoured Division), Royal Air Force, Naval Air Squadrons and Royal Navy vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf."
373,"Both Royal Air Force and Naval Air Squadrons, using various aircraft, operated from airbases in Saudi Arabia and Naval Air Squadrons from various vessels in the Persian Gulf."
374,The United Kingdom played a major role in the Battle of Norfolk where its forces destroyed over 200 Iraqi tanks and a large quantity of other vehicles.
375,and RFA ships were also deployed.
376,The light aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea.
377,Several SAS squadrons were deployed.
379,The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages.
381,"The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control."
382,This ultimately led to civilian casualties.
383,"In one noted incident, two USAF stealth planes bombed a bunker in Amiriyah, causing the deaths of 408 Iraqi civilians in the shelter."
384,"Scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were subsequently broadcast, and controversy arose over the bunker's status, with some stating that it was a civilian shelter, while others contended that it was a center of Iraqi military operations, and that the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as human shields."
385,Saddam's government gave high civilian casualty to draw support from Islamic countries.
387,"""Without electricity, hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed,"" the Harvard report said."
388,"Daponte later raised her estimate of the number of Iraqi deaths caused directly and indirectly by the Gulf War to between 142,500 and 206,000."
389,"The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy."
392,This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports.
393,"General Schwarzkopf talked about ""a very, very large number of dead in these units, a very, very large number indeed."""
394,"The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin, estimated that ""at least 65,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed""."
395,"A figure was supported by Israeli sources who speak of ""one to two hundred thousand Iraqi casualties."""
398,A further 145 Americans died in non-combat accidents.
399,"The UK suffered 47 deaths (nine to friendly fire, all by US forces), France nine, and the other countries, not including Kuwait, suffered 37 deaths (18 Saudis, one Egyptian, six UAE and three Qataris)."
400,"In all, 190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire during the war, 113 of whom were American, out of 358 coalition deaths."
401,Another 44 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded by friendly fire.
402,This number was much lower than expected.
403,Among the American dead were three female soldiers.
405,A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions.
406,Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II destroyed a group of two Warrior IFVs.
407,"Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder."
408,There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects.
409,Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects.
410,Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war.
411,"This publication, called the Riegle Report, summarized testimony this committee had received establishing that the US had in the 1980s supplied Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological warfare technology, that Saddam had used such chemical weapons against Iran and his own native Kurds, and possibly against US soldiers as well, plausibly contributing to the Gulf War Syndrome."
412,"Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, including claims of pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects."
413,"Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates."
414,Scientific opinion on the risk is mixed.
415,Some say that depleted uranium is not a significant health hazard unless it is taken into the body.
416,External exposure to radiation from depleted uranium is generally not a major concern because the alpha particles emitted by its isotopes travel only a few centimeters in air or can be stopped by a sheet of paper.
417,"Also, the uranium-235 that remains in depleted uranium emits only a small amount of low-energy gamma radiation."
418,"However, if allowed to enter the body, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, has the potential for both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and the lungs."
419,"A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."
420,"These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a 60 km stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death."
422,"This event was later called by the media ""The Highway of Death."""
423,"There were certainly a lot of dead vehicles, but not so many dead Iraqis."
424,They'd already learned to scamper off into the desert when our aircraft started to attack.
425,"Nevertheless, some people back home wrongly chose to believe we were cruelly and unusually punishing our already whipped foes."
429,"This was the ""bulldozer assault"", wherein two brigades from the US 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified ""Saddam Hussein Line""."
430,"After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers."
431,Not a single American was killed during the attack.
432,"Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq."
433,Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle.
437,Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney did not mention the First Division's tactics in an interim report to Congress on Operation Desert Storm.
440,"After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991."
441,"Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein."
442,The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens.
443,"In 2013, 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin lived in Kuwait."
444,"However, the UN subsequently spent billions rebuilding hospitals, schools, and water purification facilities throughout the country."
445,"Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, USAF Captain Richard Storr was allegedly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War."
446,"Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum."
447,Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time.
448,Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war on television.
449,Members of British Special Air Service Bravo Two Zero were captured while providing information about an Iraqi supply line of Scud missiles to coalition forces.
450,"Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group's other surviving members were violently tortured."
451,Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was sexually assaulted by one of her captors after the Black Hawk helicopter in which she was riding was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot.
452,Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet.
453,"Since Saudi Arabia houses Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest sites, many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence."
454,"The continued presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia after the war was one of the stated motivations behind the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Khobar Towers bombing, and the date chosen for the 1998 US embassy bombings (7 August), which was eight years to the day that US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia."
455,"Osama bin Laden interpreted the Islamic prophet Muhammad as banning the ""permanent presence of infidels in Arabia""."
456,"In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa, calling for US troops to leave Saudi Arabia."
460,Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions.
463,"The marshes are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes and all three were drained at different times for different reasons."
464,It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore (Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt).
465,About 30–40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets.
466,"Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out."
468,"By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately 10 months, causing widespread pollution."
469,"About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions)."
470,"About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid with in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation."
472,The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response.
474,International response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group.
475,"They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait."
477,The World Bank responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans.
478,The International Monetary Fund adopted two lending facilities – the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory & Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF).
480,"For the first time, people all over the world watched live pictures of missiles hitting their targets and fighters departing from aircraft carriers."
481,Allied forces were keen to demonstrate their weapons' accuracy.
482,"In the United States, the ""big three"" network anchors led the war's network news coverage: ABC's Peter Jennings, CBS's Dan Rather, and NBC's Tom Brokaw were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991."
483,"ABC News correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the city's quietness."
484,"But, moments later, Shepard returned as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground."
485,"On CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, reporting from Baghdad, when the war began."
486,"Rather, after the report was finished, announced unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy air traffic at bases in Saudi Arabia."
487,"On the NBC Nightly News, correspondent Mike Boettcher reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."
488,"Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun."
489,"Still, it was CNN whose coverage gained the most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the network's history, ultimately leading to the establishment of CNN International."
490,CNN correspondents John Holliman and Peter Arnett and CNN anchor Bernard Shaw relayed audio reports from Baghdad's Al-Rashid Hotel as the air strikes began.
491,The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau.
492,"When the telephones of all the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting."
493,"After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq."
494,"In the United Kingdom, the BBC devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station BBC Radio 4 to an 18-hour rolling news format creating Radio 4 News FM."
495,"The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and Kuwait's liberation."
496,"However, it paved the way for the later introduction of Radio Five Live."
497,"Two BBC journalists, John Simpson and Bob Simpson (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war's progress."
498,"They were responsible for a report which included an ""infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light."
499,"""Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and Time magazine published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline ""War in the Gulf"" emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began."
500,US policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War.
501,The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot.
502,Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military.
503,Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers.
504,"Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward."
505,This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq.
506,"This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course."
507,"About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and US journalists returned en masse to Baghdad."
508,"NBC's Tom Aspell, ABC's Bill Blakemore, and CBS News' Betsy Aaron filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship."
509,"Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately."
510,"A British crew from CBS News, David Green and Andy Thompson, equipped with satellite transmission equipment, traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the next day."
511,Alternative media outlets provided views opposing the war.
512,"Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a 10-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project."
513,"The series' first program War, Oil and Power was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out."
514,"News World Order was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the media's complicity in promoting the war, as well as Americans' reactions to the media coverage."
515,"In San Francisco, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations."
516,Local media outlets in cities across the USA screened similar oppositional media.
517,"The organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home."
518,Some authors have called it the Second Gulf War to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War.
520,Terms in other languages include French: la Guerre du Golfe and German: Golfkrieg (Gulf War); German: Zweiter Golfkrieg (Second Gulf War); French: Guerre du Koweït (War of Kuwait).
522,"Operation Desert Storm was the US name of the airland conflict from 17 January 1991, through 28 February 1991."
523,"Operation Desert Sabre (early name Operation Desert Sword) was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the ""100-hour war"") from 24 to 28 February 1991, in itself, part of Operation Desert Storm."
524,"Operation Desert Farewell was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait's liberation, sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Calm."
525,Operation Granby was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict.
530,Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.
531,"Other bombs included cluster bombs, which disperse numerous submunitions, and daisy cutters, 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards."
532,Global Positioning System (GPS) units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert.
533,"Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units."
534,Two examples of this are the US Navy's Grumman E-2 Hawkeye and the US Air Force's Boeing E-3 Sentry.
535,Both were used in command and control area of operations.
536,"These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces."
537,It is one of several reasons coalition forces dominated the air war.
538,American-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq's battle plans.
539,"Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American electronic warfare aircraft, leading to more precise bombings."
540,Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany.
541,Scud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate.
542,"Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel."
543,"The US military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time, but later analysis gives figures as low as 9%, with 45% of the 158 Patriot launches being against debris or false targets."
544,"The Dutch Ministry of Defense, which also sent Patriot missiles to protect civilians in Israel and Turkey, later disputed the higher claim."
545,"Further, there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile's failure to engage an incoming Scud, resulting in deaths."
546,"Both the US Army and the missile manufacturers maintained the Patriot delivered a ""miracle performance"" in the Gulf War."
547,"There have also been numerous depictions in film including Jarhead (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name."
