Anatomy is a branch of natural science which deals with the structural organization of living things.
"It is an old science, having its beginnings in prehistoric times."
"Anatomy is inherently tied to developmental biology, embryology, comparative anatomy, evolutionary biology, and phylogeny, as these are the processes by which anatomy is generated, both over immediate and long-term timescales."
"Anatomy and physiology, which study the structure and function of organisms and their parts respectively, make a natural pair of related disciplines, and are often studied together."
"Macroscopic anatomy, or gross anatomy, is the examination of an animal's body parts using unaided eyesight."
Gross anatomy also includes the branch of superficial anatomy.
"Microscopic anatomy involves the use of optical instruments in the study of the tissues of various structures, known as histology, and also in the study of cells."
The history of anatomy is characterized by a progressive understanding of the functions of the organs and structures of the human body.
"Methods have also improved dramatically, advancing from the examination of animals by dissection of carcasses and cadavers (corpses) to 20th century medical imaging techniques including X-ray, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging."
"It includes the appearance and position of the various parts, the materials from which they are composed, their locations and their relationships with other parts."
"Anatomy is quite distinct from physiology and biochemistry, which deal respectively with the functions of those parts and the chemical processes involved."
"Gross anatomy is the study of structures large enough to be seen with the naked eye, and also includes superficial anatomy or surface anatomy, the study by sight of the external body features."
"Methods used include dissection, in which a body is opened and its organs studied, and endoscopy, in which a video camera-equipped instrument is inserted through a small incision in the body wall and used to explore the internal organs and other structures."
"However, substantially the same structures and tissues are found throughout the rest of the animal kingdom and the term also includes the anatomy of other animals."
The term zootomy is also sometimes used to specifically refer to non-human animals.
The structure and tissues of plants are of a dissimilar nature and they are studied in plant anatomy.
Most animals have bodies differentiated into separate tissues and these animals are also known as eumetazoans.
"They have an internal digestive chamber, with one or two openings; the gametes are produced in multicellular sex organs, and the zygotes include a blastula stage in their embryonic development."
"Vacuoles, when present, are more in number and much smaller than those in the plant cell."
"The body tissues are composed of numerous types of cell, including those found in muscles, nerves and skin."
"Each typically has a cell membrane formed of phospholipids, cytoplasm and a nucleus."
All of the different cells of an animal are derived from the embryonic germ layers.
Those simpler invertebrates which are formed from two germ layers of ectoderm and endoderm are called diploblastic and the more developed animals whose structures and organs are formed from three germ layers are called triploblastic.
"All of a triploblastic animal's tissues and organs are derived from the three germ layers of the embryo, the ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm."
"Animal tissues can be grouped into four basic types: connective, epithelial, muscle and nervous tissue."
Connective tissue gives shape to organs and holds them in place.
"The main types are loose connective tissue, adipose tissue, fibrous connective tissue, cartilage and bone."
"The extracellular matrix contains proteins, the chief and most abundant of which is collagen."
Collagen plays a major part in organizing and maintaining tissues.
The matrix can be modified to form a skeleton to support or protect the body.
"An exoskeleton is a thickened, rigid cuticle which is stiffened by mineralization, as in crustaceans or by the cross-linking of its proteins as in insects."
"An endoskeleton is internal and present in all developed animals, as well as in many of those less developed."
"Epithelial cells can be squamous (flat), cuboidal or columnar and rest on a basal lamina, the upper layer of the basement membrane, the lower layer is the reticular lamina lying next to the connective tissue in the extracellular matrix secreted by the epithelial cells."
"There are many different types of epithelium, modified to suit a particular function."
In the respiratory tract there is a type of ciliated epithelial lining; in the small intestine there are microvilli on the epithelial lining and in the large intestine there are intestinal villi.
Skin consists of an outer layer of keratinized stratified squamous epithelium that covers the exterior of the vertebrate body.
Keratinocytes make up to 95% of the cells in the skin.
The epithelial cells on the external surface of the body typically secrete an extracellular matrix in the form of a cuticle.
In simple animals this may just be a coat of glycoproteins.
"In more advanced animals, many glands are formed of epithelial cells."
"Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs."
"Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle."
Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically.
It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility over a wide range of stretch lengths.
It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers.
Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension.
It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws.
Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two.
The filaments are staggered and this is the type of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions.
In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets.
"Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels."
"Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body."
"In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles."
"In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus."
"In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks to other parts of the organism."
Neurons can be connected together in ganglia.
"In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a peripheral nervous system."
The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs.
"The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach."
The spinal cord is protected by the vertebral column and is above the notochord and the gastrointestinal tract is below it.
"Nervous tissue is derived from the ectoderm, connective tissues are derived from mesoderm, and gut is derived from the endoderm."
At the posterior end is a tail which continues the spinal cord and vertebrae but not the gut.
"The mouth is found at the anterior end of the animal, and the anus at the base of the tail."
"The defining characteristic of a vertebrate is the vertebral column, formed in the development of the segmented series of vertebrae."
In most vertebrates the notochord becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs.
"However, a few vertebrates, such as the sturgeon and the coelacanth retain the notochord into adulthood."
"Jawed vertebrates are typified by paired appendages, fins or legs, which may be secondarily lost."
The limbs of vertebrates are considered to be homologous because the same underlying skeletal structure was inherited from their last common ancestor.
This is one of the arguments put forward by Charles Darwin to support his theory of evolution.
"The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the fish, is either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish."
"The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong."
The ribs attach to the spine and there are no limbs or limb girdles.
"The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which with the exception of the caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine."
They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk.
The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop.
The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision.
There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear.
"Their bodies tend to be dorso-ventrally flattened, they usually have five pairs of gill slits and a large mouth set on the underside of the head."
The dermis is covered with separate dermal placoid scales.
"They have a cloaca into which the urinary and genital passages open, but not a swim bladder."
"Cartilaginous fish produce a small number of large, yolky eggs."
"They have a bony skeleton, are generally laterally flattened, have five pairs of gills protected by an operculum, and a mouth at or near the tip of the snout."
The dermis is covered with overlapping scales.
"Bony fish have a swim bladder which helps them maintain a constant depth in the water column, but not a cloaca."
They mostly spawn a large number of small eggs with little yolk which they broadcast into the water column.
"They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size."
Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock with each other and have articular processes.
Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae.
"Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified."
"Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands."
"The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle."
They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea.
"Amphibians breathe by means of buccal pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils."
These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat.
The feet have four or five digits and the toes are often webbed for swimming or have suction pads for climbing.
Frogs have large eyes and no tail.
"Salamanders resemble lizards in appearance; their short legs project sideways, the belly is close to or in contact with the ground and they have a long tail."
Caecilians superficially resemble earthworms and are limbless.
They burrow by means of zones of muscle contractions which move along the body and they swim by undulating their body from side to side.
"They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size."
Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians.
The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size.
The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer.
Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls.
The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams.
"The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species."
"The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species."
They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below.
These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine.
The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell.
"Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates."
"There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus."
The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull.
There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews.
The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down.
"The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi."
This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider.
"Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes."
"The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs."
The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole.
"Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent ""spectacle"" scales."
They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull.
The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed.
It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming.
The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull.
"The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating."
Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged.
"Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood."
"Birds are endothermic, have a high metabolic rate, a light skeletal system and powerful muscles."
"The long bones are thin, hollow and very light."
Air sac extensions from the lungs occupy the centre of some bones.
The sternum is wide and usually has a keel and the caudal vertebrae are fused.
There are no teeth and the narrow jaws are adapted into a horn-covered beak.
"The eyes are relatively large, particularly in nocturnal species such as owls."
"Large flight feathers are found on the wings and tail, contour feathers cover the bird's surface and fine down occurs on young birds and under the contour feathers of water birds."
The only cutaneous gland is the single uropygial gland near the base of the tail.
This produces an oily secretion that waterproofs the feathers when the bird preens.
"There are scales on the legs, feet and claws on the tips of the toes."
They mostly have four limbs but some aquatic mammals have no limbs or limbs modified into fins and the forelimbs of bats are modified into wings.
"The legs of most mammals are situated below the trunk, which is held well clear of the ground."
"The bones of mammals are well ossified and their teeth, which are usually differentiated, are coated in a layer of prismatic enamel."
"The teeth are shed once (milk teeth) during the animal's lifetime or not at all, as is the case in cetaceans."
Mammals have three bones in the middle ear and a cochlea in the inner ear.
They are clothed in hair and their skin contains glands which secrete sweat.
"Some of these glands are specialized as mammary glands, producing milk to feed the young."
Mammals breathe with lungs and have a muscular diaphragm separating the thorax from the abdomen which helps them draw air into the lungs.
The mammalian heart has four chambers and oxygenated and deoxygenated blood are kept entirely separate.
"The exception to this are the egg-laying monotremes, the platypus and the echidnas of Australia."
"Most other mammals have a placenta through which the developing foetus obtains nourishment, but in marsupials, the foetal stage is very short and the immature young is born and finds its way to its mother's pouch where it latches on to a nipple and completes its development."
"Humans have a head, neck, trunk (which includes the thorax and abdomen), two arms and hands, and two legs and feet."
"Generally, students of certain biological sciences, paramedics, prosthetists and orthotists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nurses, podiatrists, and medical students learn gross anatomy and microscopic anatomy from anatomical models, skeletons, textbooks, diagrams, photographs, lectures and tutorials and in addition, medical students generally also learn gross anatomy through practical experience of dissection and inspection of cadavers."
The study of microscopic anatomy (or histology) can be aided by practical experience examining histological preparations (or slides) under a microscope.
"Human anatomy, physiology and biochemistry are complementary basic medical sciences, which are generally taught to medical students in their first year at medical school."
"Human anatomy can be taught regionally or systemically; that is, respectively, studying anatomy by bodily regions such as the head and chest, or studying by specific systems, such as the nervous or respiratory systems."
"The major anatomy textbook, Gray's Anatomy, has been reorganized from a systems format to a regional format, in line with modern teaching methods."
"A thorough working knowledge of anatomy is required by physicians, especially surgeons and doctors working in some diagnostic specialties, such as histopathology and radiology."
"Academic anatomists are usually employed by universities, medical schools or teaching hospitals."
"They are often involved in teaching anatomy, and research into certain systems, organs, tissues or cells."
They constitute about 95% of the animal species.
"By definition, none of these creatures has a backbone."
The cells of single-cell protozoans have the same basic structure as those of multicellular animals but some parts are specialized into the equivalent of tissues and organs.
"Locomotion is often provided by cilia or flagella or may proceed via the advance of pseudopodia, food may be gathered by phagocytosis, energy needs may be supplied by photosynthesis and the cell may be supported by an endoskeleton or an exoskeleton."
"The most basic types of metazoan tissues are epithelium and connective tissue, both of which are present in nearly all invertebrates."
The outer surface of the epidermis is normally formed of epithelial cells and secretes an extracellular matrix which provides support to the organism.
"An endoskeleton derived from the mesoderm is present in echinoderms, sponges and some cephalopods."
"Exoskeletons are derived from the epidermis and is composed of chitin in arthropods (insects, spiders, ticks, shrimps, crabs, lobsters)."
"Calcium carbonate constitutes the shells of molluscs, brachiopods and some tube-building polychaete worms and silica forms the exoskeleton of the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria."
"Other invertebrates may have no rigid structures but the epidermis may secrete a variety of surface coatings such as the pinacoderm of sponges, the gelatinous cuticle of cnidarians (polyps, sea anemones, jellyfish) and the collagenous cuticle of annelids."
"The outer epithelial layer may include cells of several types including sensory cells, gland cells and stinging cells."
"He observed that when a ring-like portion of bark was removed on a trunk a swelling occurred in the tissues above the ring, and he unmistakably interpreted this as growth stimulated by food coming down from the leaves, and being captured above the ring."
"The segments of the body are organized into three distinct parts, a head, a thorax and an abdomen."
"The head typically bears a pair of sensory antennae, a pair of compound eyes, one to three simple eyes (ocelli) and three sets of modified appendages that form the mouthparts."
"The thorax has three pairs of segmented legs, one pair each for the three segments that compose the thorax and one or two pairs of wings."
"The abdomen is composed of eleven segments, some of which may be fused and houses the digestive, respiratory, excretory and reproductive systems."
Spiders have no wings and no antennae.
They have mouthparts called chelicerae which are often connected to venom glands as most spiders are venomous.
They have a second pair of appendages called pedipalps attached to the cephalothorax.
These have similar segmentation to the legs and function as taste and smell organs.
At the end of each male pedipalp is a spoon-shaped cymbium that acts to support the copulatory organ.
It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures.
Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively close to the surface of the body.
Comparative anatomy relates to the comparison of anatomical structures (both gross and microscopic) in different animals.
Artistic anatomy relates to anatomic studies for artistic reasons.
"Over time, this medical practice expanded by a continually developing understanding of the functions of organs and structures in the body."
"Phenomenal anatomical observations of the human body were made, which have contributed towards the understanding of the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and the nervous system."
The Hellenistic Egyptian city of Alexandria was the stepping-stone for Greek anatomy and physiology.
"Alexandria not only housed the biggest library for medical records and books of the liberal arts in the world during the time of the Greeks, but was also home to many medical practitioners and philosophers."
"Great patronage of the arts and sciences from the Ptolemy rulers helped raise Alexandria up, further rivalling the cultural and scientific achievements of other Greek states."
Some of the most striking advances in early anatomy and physiology took place in Hellenistic Alexandria.
Two of the most famous anatomists and physiologists of the third century were Herophilus and Erasistratus.
These two physicians helped pioneer human dissection for medical research.
"They also conducted vivisections on the cadavers of condemned criminals, which was considered taboo until the Renaissance—Herophilus was recognized as the first person to perform systematic dissections."
Herophilus became known for his anatomical works making impressing contributions to many branches of anatomy and many other aspects of medicine.
"Some of the works included classifying the system of the pulse, the discovery that human arteries had thicker walls than veins, and that the atria were parts of the heart."
"Herophilus's knowledge of the human body has provided vital input towards understanding the brain, eye, liver, reproductive organs and nervous system, and characterizing the course of disease."
"Erasistratus accurately described the structure of the brain, including the cavities and membranes, and made a distinction between its cerebrum and cerebellum During his study in Alexandria, Erasistratus was particularly concerned with studies of the circulatory and nervous systems."
"He was able to distinguish the sensory and the motor nerves in the human body and believed that air entered the lungs and heart, which was then carried throughout the body."
"His distinction between the arteries and veins—the arteries carrying the air through the body, while the veins carried the blood from the heart was a great anatomical discovery."
"Erasistratus was also responsible for naming and describing the function of the epiglottis and the valves of the heart, including the tricuspid."
"During the third century, Greek physicians were able to differentiate nerves from blood vessels and tendons and to realize that the nerves convey neural impulses."
It was Herophilus who made the point that damage to motor nerves induced paralysis.
"Herophilus named the meninges and ventricles in the brain, appreciated the division between cerebellum and cerebrum and recognized that the brain was the ""seat of intellect"" and not a ""cooling chamber"" as propounded by Aristotle Herophilus is also credited with describing the optic, oculomotor, motor division of the trigeminal, facial, vestibulocochlear and hypoglossal nerves."
Great feats were made during the third century BCE in both the digestive and reproductive systems.
"Herophilus was able to discover and describe not only the salivary glands, but the small intestine and liver."
He showed that the uterus is a hollow organ and described the ovaries and uterine tubes.
Aristotle described vertebrate anatomy based on animal dissection.
Praxagoras identified the difference between arteries and veins.
He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals.
He was one of the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection experiments on animals.
"Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years."
His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.
"Between 1275 and 1326, the anatomists Mondino de Luzzi, Alessandro Achillini and Antonio Benivieni at Bologna carried out the first systematic human dissections since ancient times."
Mondino's Anatomy of 1316 was the first textbook in the medieval rediscovery of human anatomy.
"It describes the body in the order followed in Mondino's dissections, starting with the abdomen, then the thorax, then the head and limbs."
"Originally from Brabant, Vesalius published the influential book De humani corporis fabrica (""the structure of the human body""), a large format book in seven volumes, in 1543."
Classes in anatomy needed a continual stream of cadavers for dissection and these were difficult to obtain.
"Philadelphia, Baltimore and New York were all renowned for body snatching activity as criminals raided graveyards at night, removing newly buried corpses from their coffins."
A similar problem existed in Britain where demand for bodies became so great that grave-raiding and even anatomy murder were practised to obtain cadavers.
Some graveyards were in consequence protected with watchtowers.
"He was responsible for setting up the system of three years of ""pre-clinical"" academic teaching in the sciences underlying medicine, including especially anatomy."
This system lasted until the reform of medical training in 1993 and 2003.
"As well as teaching, he collected many vertebrate skeletons for his museum of comparative anatomy, published over 70 research papers, and became famous for his public dissection of the Tay Whale."
From 1822 the Royal College of Surgeons regulated the teaching of anatomy in medical schools.
"Medical museums provided examples in comparative anatomy, and were often used in teaching."
Ignaz Semmelweis investigated puerperal fever and he discovered how it was caused.
He noticed that the frequently fatal fever occurred more often in mothers examined by medical students than by midwives.
The students went from the dissecting room to the hospital ward and examined women in childbirth.
"Semmelweis showed that when the trainees washed their hands in chlorinated lime before each clinical examination, the incidence of puerperal fever among the mothers could be reduced dramatically."
"Before the modern medical era, the main means for studying the internal structures of the body were dissection of the dead and inspection, palpation and auscultation of the living."
It was the advent of microscopy that opened up an understanding of the building blocks that constituted living tissues.
"Technical advances in the development of achromatic lenses increased the resolving power of the microscope and around 1839, Matthias Jakob Schleiden and Theodor Schwann identified that cells were the fundamental unit of organization of all living things."
Study of small structures involved passing light through them and the microtome was invented to provide sufficiently thin slices of tissue to examine.
Staining techniques using artificial dyes were established to help distinguish between different types of tissue.
Advances in the fields of histology and cytology began in the late 19th century along with advances in surgical techniques allowing for the painless and safe removal of biopsy specimens.
The invention of the electron microscope brought a great advance in resolution power and allowed research into the ultrastructure of cells and the organelles and other structures within them.
X-rays can be passed through the body and used in medical radiography and fluoroscopy to differentiate interior structures that have varying degrees of opaqueness.
"Magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography, and ultrasound imaging have all enabled examination of internal structures in unprecedented detail to a degree far beyond the imagination of earlier generations."
Ancient Greek literature is literature written in the Ancient Greek language from the earliest texts until the time of the Byzantine Empire.
"The earliest surviving works of ancient Greek literature, dating back to the early Archaic period, are the two epic poems the Iliad and the Odyssey, set in an idealized archaic past today identified as having some relation to the Mycenaean era."
"These two epics, along with the Homeric Hymns and the two poems of Hesiod, Theogony and Works and Days, comprised the major foundations of the Greek literary tradition that would continue into the Classical, Hellenistic, and Roman periods."
"The lyric poets Sappho, Alcaeus, and Pindar were highly influential during the early development of the Greek poetic tradition."
Aeschylus is the earliest Greek tragic playwright for whom any plays have survived complete.
"Sophocles is famous for his tragedies about Oedipus, particularly Oedipus the King and Antigone."
Euripides is known for his plays which often pushed the boundaries of the tragic genre.
"The comedic playwright Aristophanes wrote in the genre of Old Comedy, while the later playwright Menander was an early pioneer of New Comedy."
"The historians Herodotus of Halicarnassus and Thucydides, who both lived during the sixth century BC, wrote accounts of events that happened shortly before and during their own lifetimes."
"The philosopher Plato wrote dialogues, usually centered around his teacher Socrates, dealing with various philosophical subjects, whereas his student Aristotle wrote numerous treatises, which later became highly influential."
"Important later writers included Apollonius of Rhodes, who wrote The Argonautica, an epic poem about the voyage of the Argonauts; Archimedes, who wrote groundbreaking mathematical treatises; and Plutarch, who wrote mainly biographies and essays."
"The second-century AD writer Lucian of Samosata was a Hellenized Syrian, who wrote primarily works of satire."
Ancient Greek literature has had a profound impact on later Greek literature and also western literature at large.
"In particular, many ancient Roman authors drew inspiration from their Greek predecessors."
"Ever since the Renaissance, European authors in general, including Dante Alighieri, William Shakespeare, John Milton, and James Joyce, have all drawn heavily on classical themes and motifs."
"The earliest known Greek writings are Mycenaean, written in the Linear B syllabary on clay tablets."
These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade.
The first division was between prose and poetry.
"Within poetry there were three super-genres: epic, lyric and drama."
The common European terminology about literary genres is directly derived from the ancient Greek terminology.
Prose literature can largely be said to begin with Herodotus.
"Over time, several genres of prose literature developed, but the distinctions between them were frequently blurred."
The figure of Homer is shrouded in mystery.
"Although the works as they now stand are credited to him, it is certain that their roots reach far back before his time."
The Iliad is a narrative of a single episode spanning over the course of a ten-day-period from near the end of the ten years of the Trojan War.
"It centers on the person of Achilles, who embodied the Greek heroic ideal."
"The Odyssey is an account of the adventures of Odysseus, one of the warriors at Troy."
"After ten years fighting the war, he spends another ten years sailing back home to his wife and family."
"Penelope was considered the ideal female, Homer depicted her as the ideal female based on her commitment, modesty, purity, and respect during her marriage with Odysseus."
"During his ten-year voyage, he loses all of his comrades and ships and makes his way home to Ithaca disguised as a beggar."
Both of these works were based on ancient legends.
"The stories are told in language that is simple, and direct."
"The Homeric dialect was an archaic language based on Ionic dialect mixed with some element of Aeolic dialect and Attic dialect, the latter due to the Athenian edition of the 6th century BC."
"Unlike Homer, Hesiod refers to himself in his poetry."
"Nonetheless, nothing is known about him from any external source."
"He was a native of Boeotia in central Greece, and is thought to have lived and worked around 700 BC."
Hesiod's two extant poems are Works and Days and Theogony.
"Works and Days is a faithful depiction of the poverty-stricken country life he knew so well, and it sets forth principles and rules for farmers."
Theogony is a systematic account of creation and of the gods.
"Despite the name, however, the lyric poetry in this general meaning was divided in four genres, two of which were not accompanied by cithara, but by flute."
These two latter genres were elegiac poetry and iambic poetry.
Both were written in the Ionic dialect.
Elegiac poems were written in elegiac couplets and iambic poems were written in iambic trimeter.
"The first of the lyric poets was probably Archilochus of Paros, 7th century BC, the most important iambic poet."
"Only fragments remain of his work, as is the case with most of the poets."
Lyric poems often employed highly varied poetic meters.
"The most famous of all lyric poets were the so-called ""Nine Lyric Poets""."
"In antiquity, her poems were regarded with the same degree of respect as the poems of Homer."
"Only one of her poems, ""Ode to Aphrodite"", has survived to the present day in its original, completed form."
"In addition to Sappho, her contemporary Alcaeus of Lesbos was also notable for monodic lyric poetry."
"The poetry written by Alcman was considered beautiful, even though he wrote exclusively in the Doric dialect, which was normally considered unpleasant to hear."
The later poet Pindar of Thebes was renowned for his choral lyric poetry.
Choral performances were a common tradition in all Greek city-states.
"The Athenians credited a man named Thespis with having invented drama by introducing the first actor, whose primary purpose was to interact with the leader of the chorus."
The tragic plays grew out of simple choral songs and dialogues performed at festivals of the god Dionysus.
"In the classical period, performances included three tragedies and one pastoral drama, depicting four different episodes of the same myth."
Wealthy citizens were chosen to bear the expense of costuming and training the chorus as a public and religious duty.
Attendance at the festival performances was regarded as an act of worship.
Performances were held in the great open-air theater of Dionysus in Athens.
"The authorship of Prometheus Bound, which is traditionally attributed to Aeschylus, and Rhesus, which is traditionally attributed to Euripides, are, however, questioned."
There are seven surviving tragedies attributed to Aeschylus.
"Three of these plays, Agamemnon, The Libation-Bearers, and The Eumenides, form a trilogy known as the Oresteia."
"The Theban Trilogy consists of Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone."
"Although the plays are often called a ""trilogy,"" they were actually written many years apart."
"Antigone, the last of the three plays sequentially, was actually first to be written, having been composed in 441 BC, towards the beginning of Sophocles's career."
"Oedipus the King, the most famous of the three, was written around 429 BC at the midpoint of Sophocles's career."
"The most well-known of these plays are Medea, Hippolytus, and Bacchae."
"Rhesus is sometimes thought to have been written by Euripides' son, or to have been a posthumous reproduction of a play by Euripides."
Euripides pushed the limits of the tragic genre and many of the elements in his plays were more typical of comedy than tragedy.
"His play Alcestis, for instance, has often been categorized as a ""problem play"" or perhaps even as a work of tragicomedy rather than a true tragedy due to its comedic elements and the fact that it has a happy ending."
"Like tragedy, comedy arose from a ritual in honor of Dionysus, but in this case the plays were full of frank obscenity, abuse, and insult."
"At Athens, the comedies became an official part of the festival celebration in 486 BC, and prizes were offered for the best productions."
"As with the tragedians, few works still remain of the great comedic writers."
The only complete surviving works of classical comedy are eleven plays written by the playwright Aristophanes.
These are a treasure trove of comic presentation.
He poked fun at everyone and every institution.
Aristophanes has been praised highly for his dramatic skill and artistry.
"John Lemprière's Bibliotheca Classica describes him as, quite simply, ""the greatest comic dramatist in world literature: by his side Molière seems dull and Shakespeare clownish."""
"Of all Aristophanes's plays, however, the one that has received the most lasting recognition is The Frogs, which simultaneously satirizes and immortalizes the two giants of Athenian tragedy: Aeschylus and Euripides."
"When it was performed for the first time at the Lenaia Festival in 405 BC, just one year after the death of Euripides, the Athenians awarded it first prize."
"It was the only Greek play that was ever given an encore performance, which took place two months later at the City Dionysia."
"Even today, The Frogs still appeals to modern audiences."
"Although the genre was popular, only one complete example of a satyr play has survived: Cyclops by Euripides."
"Large portions of a second satyr play, Ichneutae by Sophocles, have been recovered from the site of Oxyrhynchus in Egypt among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri."
"Herodotus is commonly called ""The Father of History."""
His book The Histories is among the oldest works of prose literature in existence.
"Xenophon's most famous work is his book The Anabasis, a detailed, first-hand account of his participation in a Greek mercenary army that tried to help the Persian Cyrus expel his brother from the throne."
"Xenophon also wrote three works in praise of the philosopher Socrates: The Apology of Socrates to the Jury, The Symposium, and Memorabilia."
"Although both Xenophon and Plato knew Socrates, their accounts are very different."
Many comparisons have been made between the account of the military historian and the account of the poet-philosopher.
"Among the earliest Greek philosophers were the three so-called ""Milesian philosophers"": Thales of Miletus, Anaximander, and Anaximenes."
Socrates did not write any books himself and modern scholars debate whether or not Plato's portrayal of him is accurate.
"Some scholars contend that many of his ideas, or at least a vague approximation of them, are expressed in Plato's early socratic dialogues."
"Meanwhile, other scholars have argued that Plato's portrayal of Socrates is merely a fictional representation intended to expound Plato's own opinions who has very little to do with the historical figure of the same name."
The debate over the extent to which Plato's portrayal of Socrates represents the actual Socrates's ideas is known as the Socratic problem.
"Plato expressed his ideas through dialogues, that is, written works purporting to describe conversations between different individuals."
"The first sentence of his Metaphysics reads: ""All men by nature desire to know."""
"He has, therefore, been called the ""Father of those who know."""
"His medieval disciple Thomas Aquinas referred to him simply as ""the Philosopher""."
"Aristotle was a student at Plato's Academy, and like his teacher, he wrote dialogues, or conversations."
"However, none of these exist today."
"The body of writings that have come down to the present probably represents lectures that he delivered at his own school in Athens, the Lyceum."
"Even from these books, the enormous range of his interests is evident: He explored matters other than those that are today considered philosophical; the extant treatises cover logic, the physical and biological sciences, ethics, politics, and constitutional government."
"Among Aristotle's most notable works are Politics, Nicomachean Ethics, Poetics, On the Soul, and Rhetoric."
Philip's son Alexander the Great extended his father's conquests greatly.
"It also soon attracted a large Jewish population, making it the largest center for Jewish scholarship in the ancient world."
"In addition, it later became a major focal point for the development of Christian thought."
"The Musaeum, or Shrine to the Muses, which included the library and school, was founded by Ptolemy I."
The institution was from the beginning intended as a great international school and library.
"The library, eventually containing more than a half million volumes, was mostly in Greek."
It was intended to serve as a repository for every work of classical Greek literature that could be found.
The Roman Virgil later wrote his Eclogues in this genre.
"Callimachus, a scholar at the Library of Alexandria, composed the Aetia (""Causes""), a long poem written in four volumes of elegiac couplets describing the legendary origins of obscure customs, festivals, and names, which he probably wrote in several stages over the course of many years in the third century BC."
"The Aetia was lost during the Middle Ages, but, over the course of the twentieth century, much of it was recovered due to new discoveries of ancient papyri."
"Scholars initially denigrated it as ""second-rate"", showing great learning, but lacking true ""art""."
"Over the course of the century, scholarly appraisal of it greatly improved, with many scholars now seeing it in a much more positive light."
"Callimachus also wrote short poems for special occasions and at least one short epic, the Ibis, which was directed against his former pupil Apollonius."
"The poet Aratus wrote the hexameter poem Phaenomena, a poetic rendition of Eudoxus of Cnidus's treatise on the stars written in the fourth century BC."
The most notable writer of New Comedy was the Athenian playwright Menander.
"None of Menander's plays have survived to the present day in their complete form, but one play, The Bad-Tempered Man, has survived to the present day in a near-complete form."
Most of another play entitled The Girl from Samos and large portions of another five have also survived.
"His History, though lost, is significant because of its influence on Polybius."
"In 38 books it covered the history of Sicily and Italy to the year 264 BC, which is where Polybius begins his work."
"Timaeus also wrote the Olympionikai, a valuable chronological study of the Olympic Games."
"Authors of ancient bios, such as the works of Nepos and Plutarch's Parallel Lives imitated many of the same sources and techniques of the contemporary historiographies of ancient Greece, notably including the works of Herodotus and Thucydides."
"There were various forms of ancient biographies, including 1) philosophical biographies that brought out the moral character of their subject (such as Diogenes Laertius's Lives of Eminent Philosophers 2) literary biographies which discussed the lives of orators and poets (such as Philostratus's Lives of the Sophists) 3) school and reference biographies that offered a short sketch of someone including their ancestry, major events and accomplishments, and death, 4) autobiographies, commentaries and memoirs where the subject presents his own life and 5) historical/political biography focusing on the lives of those active in the military, among other categories."
He is credited with being the first person to measure the Earth's circumference.
Much that was written by the mathematicians Euclid and Archimedes has been preserved.
"Euclid is known for his Elements, much of which was drawn from his predecessor Eudoxus of Cnidus."
"The Elements is a treatise on geometry, and it has exerted a continuing influence on mathematics."
From Archimedes several treatises have come down to the present.
"Among them are Measurement of the Circle, in which he worked out the value of pi; The Method of Mechanical Theorems, on his work in mechanics; The Sand Reckoner; and On Floating Bodies."
A manuscript of his works is currently being studied.
The Milesiaka by Aristides of Miletos was probably written during the second century BC.
"The Milesiaka itself has not survived to the present day in its complete form, but various references to it have survived."
The discovery of several fragments of Lollianos's Phoenician Tale reveal the existence of a genre of ancient Greek picaresque novel.
"Romans of literary or rhetorical inclination looked to Greek models, and Greek literature of all types continued to be read and produced both by native speakers of Greek and later by Roman authors as well."
"A notable characteristic of this period was the expansion of literary criticism as a genre, particularly as exemplified by Demetrius, Pseudo-Longinus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus."
"The New Testament, written by various authors in varying qualities of Koine Greek also hails from this period, the most important works being the Gospels and the Epistles of Saint Paul."
He also wrote a poetic paraphrase of The Gospel of John.
Nonnus probably lived sometime during the late fourth century AD or early fifth century AD.
He was brought to Rome as a hostage in 168.
In Rome he became a friend of the general Scipio Aemilianus.
He probably accompanied the general to Spain and North Africa in the wars against Carthage.
"He wrote a universal history, Bibliotheca Historica, in 40 books."
"Of these, the first five and the 11th through the 20th remain."
The first two parts covered history through the early Hellenistic era.
"The third part takes the story to the beginning of Caesar's wars in Gaul, now France."
Dionysius of Halicarnassus lived late in the first century BC.
"His history of Rome from its origins to the First Punic War (264 to 241 BC) is written from a Roman point of view, but it is carefully researched."
"Appian wrote on Rome and its conquests, while Arrian is remembered for his work on the campaigns of Alexander the Great."
Arrian served in the Roman army.
His book therefore concentrates heavily on the military aspects of Alexander's life.
"Arrian also wrote a philosophical treatise, the Diatribai, based on the teachings of his mentor Epictetus."
"Best known of the late Greek historians to modern readers is Plutarch of Chaeronea, who died about AD 119."
His Parallel Lives of great Greek and Roman leaders has been read by every generation since the work was first published.
"Surviving examples of this popular genre include works such as Aulus Gellius's Attic Nights, Athenaeus of Naucratis's Deipnosophistae, and Claudius Aelianus's De Natura Animalium and Varia Historia."
"He was a careful student of anatomy, and his works exerted a powerful influence on medicine for the next 1,400 years."
"Strabo, who died about AD 23, was a geographer and historian."
His Historical Sketches in 47 volumes has nearly all been lost.
His Geographical Sketches remain as the only existing ancient book covering the whole range of people and countries known to the Greeks and Romans through the time of Augustus.
"Pausanias, who lived in the 2nd century AD, was also a geographer."
His Description of Greece is a travel guide describing the geography and mythic history of Greece during the second century.
"He lived during the 2nd century AD, though little is known of his life."
"His masterpiece, originally entitled The Mathematical Collection, has come to the present under the title Almagest, as it was translated by Arab astronomers with that title."
"It was Ptolemy who devised a detailed description of an Earth-centered universe, a notion that dominated astronomical thinking for more than 1,300 years."
"The Ptolemaic view of the universe endured until Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, and other early modern astronomers replaced it with heliocentrism."
"Unfortunately, Diogenes Laërtius often fails to cite his sources and many modern historians consider his testimony unreliable."
"Nonetheless, in spite of this, he remains the only available source on the lives of many early Greek philosophers."
His book is not entirely without merit; it does preserve a tremendous wealth of information that otherwise would not have been preserved.
He transformed Plato's philosophy into a school called Neoplatonism.
His Enneads had a wide-ranging influence on European thought until at least the seventeenth century.
"Plotinus's philosophy mainly revolved around the concepts of nous, psyche, and the ""One."
"""After the rise of Christianity, many of the most important philosophers were Christians."
"The second-century Christian apologist Justin Martyr, who wrote exclusively in Greek, made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy, especially Platonism."
"Origen of Alexandria, the founder of Christian theology, also made extensive use of ideas from Greek philosophy and was even able to hold his own against the pagan philosopher Celsus in his apologetic treatise Contra Celsum."
The ancient Greek novels Leucippe and Clitophon by Achilles Tatius and Daphnis and Chloe by Longus were both probably written during the early second century AD.
"Daphnis and Chloe, by far the most famous of the five surviving ancient Greek romance novels, is a nostalgic tale of two young lovers growing up in an idealized pastoral environment on the Greek island of Lesbos."
"The Wonders Beyond Thule by Antonius Diogenes may have also been written during the early second century AD, although scholars are unsure of its exact date."
"The Wonders Beyond Thule has not survived in its complete form, but a very lengthy summary of it written by Photios I of Constantinople has survived."
The Ephesian Tale by Xenophon of Ephesus was probably written during the late second century AD.
The satirist Lucian of Samosata lived during the late second century AD.
Lucian's works were incredibly popular during antiquity.
Over eighty different writings attributed to Lucian have survived to the present day.
Almost all of Lucian's works are written in the heavily Atticized dialect of ancient Greek language prevalent among the well-educated at the time.
"His book The Syrian Goddess, however, was written in a faux-Ionic dialect, deliberately imitating the dialect and style of Herodotus."
"Lucian's most famous work is the novel A True Story, which some authors have described as the earliest surviving work of science fiction."
"His dialogue The Lover of Lies contains several of the earliest known ghost stories as well as the earliest known version of ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice."""
"It tells the story of a young Ethiopian princess named Chariclea, who is estranged from her family and goes on many misadventures across the known world."
"Of all the ancient Greek novels, the one that attained the greatest level of popularity was the Alexander Romance, a fictionalized account of the exploits of Alexander the Great written in the third century AD."
"Eighty versions of it have survived in twenty-four different languages, attesting that, during the Middle Ages, the novel was nearly as popular as the Bible."
Ancient Roman authors adopted various styles and motifs from ancient Greek literature.
"These ideas were later, in turn, adopted by other western European writers and literary critics."
Ancient Greek literature especially influenced later Greek literature.
"For instance, the Greek novels influenced the later work Hero and Leander, written by Musaeus Grammaticus."
Ancient Roman writers were acutely aware of the ancient Greek literary legacy and many deliberately emulated the style and formula of Greek classics in their own works.
"The medieval writer Roger Bacon wrote that ""there are not four men in Latin Christendom who are acquainted with the Greek, Hebrew, and Arabic grammars."""
It was not until the Renaissance that Greek writings were rediscovered by western European scholars.
"During the Renaissance, Greek began to be taught in western European colleges and universities for the first time, which resulted in western European scholars rediscovering the literature of ancient Greece."
"The Textus Receptus, the first New Testament printed in the original Greek, was published in 1516 by the Dutch humanist scholar Desiderius Erasmus."
"Erasmus also published Latin translations of classical Greek texts, including a Latin translation of Hesiod's Works and Days."
The influence of classical Greek literature on modern literature is also evident.
Numerous figures from classical literature and mythology appear throughout The Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.
"Plutarch's Lives were a major influence on William Shakespeare and served as the main source behind his tragedies Julius Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra, and Coriolanus."
Shakespeare's comedies A Comedy of Errors and The Twelfth Night drew heavily on themes from Graeco-Roman New Comedy.
"It also makes frequent allusions to figures from classical literature and mythology, using them as symbols to convey a Christian message."
Lucian's A True Story was part of the inspiration for Jonathan Swift's novel Gulliver's Travels.
"James Joyce's novel Ulysses, heralded by critics as one of the greatest works of modern literature, is a retelling of Homer's Odyssey set in modern-day Dublin."
"The ideas expressed in Aristotle's Poetics, in particular, have influenced generations of Western writers and literary critics."
A Latin translation of an Arabic version of the Poetics by Averroes was available during the Middle Ages.
"The Cold War was a period of geopolitical tension between the Soviet Union and the United States and their respective allies, the Eastern Bloc and the Western Bloc, after World War II."
"Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but the period is generally considered to span the 1947 Truman Doctrine to the 1991 dissolution of the Soviet Union."
"The term ""cold"" is used because there was no large-scale fighting directly between the two superpowers, but they each supported major regional conflicts known as proxy wars."
"The conflict was based around the ideological and geopolitical struggle for global influence by the two powers, following their temporary alliance and victory against Nazi Germany in 1945."
The doctrine of mutually assured destruction (MAD) discouraged a pre-emptive attack by either side.
"Aside from the nuclear arsenal development and conventional military deployment, the struggle for dominance was expressed via indirect means such as psychological warfare, propaganda campaigns, espionage, far-reaching embargoes, rivalry at sports events and technological competitions such as the Space Race."
"The West was led by the United States as well as the other First World nations of the Western Bloc that were generally liberal democratic but tied to a network of authoritarian states, most of which were their former colonies."
"The East was led by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, which had an influence across the Second World."
"The US government supported right-wing governments and uprisings across the world, while the Soviet government funded communist parties and revolutions around the world."
"As nearly all the colonial states achieved independence in the period 1945–1960, they became Third World battlefields in the Cold War."
The first phase of the Cold War began immediately after the end of the Second World War in 1945.
The United States created the NATO military alliance in 1949 in the apprehension of a Soviet attack and termed their global policy against Soviet influence containment.
The Soviet Union formed the Warsaw Pact in 1955 in response to NATO.
"Major crises of this phase included the 1948–49 Berlin Blockade, the 1927–50 Chinese Civil War, the 1950–53 Korean War, the 1956 Suez Crisis, the Berlin Crisis of 1961 and the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis."
"The USSR and the US competed for influence in Latin America, the Middle East, and the decolonizing states of Africa and Asia."
"Following the Cuban Missile Crisis, a new phase began that saw the Sino-Soviet split between China and the Soviet Union complicate relations within the Communist sphere, while US ally France began to demand greater autonomy of action."
"The USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to suppress the 1968 Prague Spring, while the US experienced internal turmoil from the civil rights movement and opposition to the Vietnam War."
"In the 1960s–70s, an international peace movement took root among citizens around the world."
"Movements against nuclear arms testing and for nuclear disarmament took place, with large anti-war protests."
"By the 1970s, both sides had started making allowances for peace and security, ushering in a period of détente that saw the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks and the US opening relations with the People's Republic of China as a strategic counterweight to the USSR."
Détente collapsed at the end of the decade with the beginning of the Soviet–Afghan War in 1979.
The early 1980s were another period of elevated tension.
"The United States increased diplomatic, military, and economic pressures on the Soviet Union, at a time when it was already suffering from economic stagnation."
"Pressures for national sovereignty grew stronger in Eastern Europe, and Gorbachev refused to militarily support their governments any longer."
"In 1989, the fall of the Iron Curtain and a wave of revolutions (with the exception of Romania) peacefully overthrew all of the communist governments of Central and Eastern Europe."
The Communist Party of the Soviet Union itself lost control in the Soviet Union and was banned following an abortive coup attempt in August 1991.
"This in turn led to the formal dissolution of the USSR in December 1991, the declaration of independence of its constituent republics and the collapse of communist governments across much of Africa and Asia."
The United States was left as the world's only superpower.
The Cold War and its events have left a significant legacy.
"It is often referred to in popular culture, especially with themes of espionage and the threat of nuclear warfare."
"In The Observer of 10 March 1946, Orwell wrote, ""after the Moscow conference last December, Russia began to make a 'cold war' on Britain and the British Empire."
"""The first use of the term to describe the specific post-war geopolitical confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States came in a speech by Bernard Baruch, an influential advisor to Democratic presidents, on 16 April 1947."
"The speech, written by a journalist Herbert Bayard Swope, proclaimed, ""Let us not be deceived: we are today in the midst of a cold war."""
Newspaper columnist Walter Lippmann gave the term wide currency with his book The Cold War.
"When asked in 1947 about the source of the term, Lippmann traced it to a French term from the 1930s, la guerre froide."
"The Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in November 1917 and fulfilled their promise to withdraw from WWI, and German armies advanced rapidly across the borderlands."
The Allies responded with an economic blockade against all of Russia.
"In early March 1918, the Soviets followed through on the wave of popular disgust against the war and accepted harsh German peace terms with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
"In the eyes of some Allies, Russia now was helping Germany to win the war by freeing up a million German soldiers for the Western Front and by ""relinquishing much of Russia's food supply, industrial base, fuel supplies, and communications with Western Europe."""
"According to historian Spencer Tucker, the Allies felt, ""The treaty was the ultimate betrayal of the Allied cause and sowed the seeds for the Cold War."
"With Brest-Litovsk the spectre of German domination in Eastern Europe threatened to become reality, and the Allies now began to think seriously about military intervention,"" and proceeded to step up their ""economic warfare"" against the Bolsheviks."
"This policy was spearheaded by Minister of War Winston Churchill, a committed British imperialist and anti-communist."
"France, Japan and the United States invaded Russia in an attempt to topple the new Soviet government."
"Vladimir Lenin stated that the Soviet Union was surrounded by a ""hostile capitalist encirclement"" and he viewed diplomacy as a weapon to keep Soviet enemies divided."
"He set up an organization to promote sister revolutions worldwide, the Comintern."
"It failed everywhere; it was crushed when it tried to start revolutions in Germany, Bavaria, and Hungary."
The failures led to an inward turn by Moscow.
Britain and other Western powers—except the United States—did business and sometimes recognized the new Soviet Union.
"By 1933, old fears of Communist threats had faded, and the American business community, as well as newspaper editors, were calling for diplomatic recognition."
"However, there was no progress on the Tsarist debts Washington wanted Moscow to repay."
Expectations of expanded trade proved unrealistic.
Roosevelt named William Bullitt as ambassador from 1933 to 1936.
"Bullitt arrived in Moscow with high hopes for Soviet–American relations, but his view of the Soviet leadership soured on closer inspection."
"By the end of his tenure, Bullitt was openly hostile to the Soviet government, and he remained an outspoken anti-communist for the rest of his life."
The Soviets were embittered when Western governments chose to practice appeasement with Nazi Germany instead.
In March 1939 Britain and France—without consulting the USSR—granted Hitler control of much of Czechoslovakia at the Munich Agreement.
"Finland rejected territorial demands, prompting a Soviet invasion in November 1939."
The resulting Winter War ended in March 1940 with Finnish concessions.
"It also seized the disputed Romanian regions of Bessarabia, Northern Bukovina, and Hertza."
"But after the German Army invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa in June 1941 and declared war on the United States in December 1941, the Soviet Union and the Allied powers worked together to fight Germany."
Britain signed a formal alliance and the United States made an informal agreement.
"In wartime, the United States supplied Britain, the Soviet Union and other Allied nations through its Lend-Lease Program."
"However, Stalin remained highly suspicious, and he believed that the British and the Americans had conspired to ensure that the Soviets bore the brunt of the fighting against Germany."
"According to this view, the Western Allies had deliberately delayed opening a second anti-German front in order to step in at the last minute and shape the peace settlement."
"Thus, Soviet perceptions of the West left a strong undercurrent of tension and hostility between the Allied powers."
Each side held dissimilar ideas regarding the establishment and maintenance of post-war security.
"Some scholars contend that all the Western Allies desired a security system in which democratic governments were established as widely as possible, permitting countries to peacefully resolve differences through international organizations."
Others note that the Atlantic powers were divided in their vision of the new post-war world.
"Roosevelt's goals—military victory in both Europe and Asia, the achievement of global American economic supremacy over the British Empire, and the creation of a world peace organization—were more global than Churchill's, which were mainly centered on securing control over the Mediterranean, ensuring the survival of the British Empire, and the independence of Central and Eastern European countries as a buffer between the Soviets and the United Kingdom."
The Soviet Union sought to dominate the internal affairs of countries in its border regions.
"During the war, Stalin had created special training centers for communists from different countries so that they could set up secret police forces loyal to Moscow as soon as the Red Army took control."
"Soviet agents took control of the media, especially radio; they quickly harassed and then banned all independent civic institutions, from youth groups to schools, churches and rival political parties."
"With the Soviets already occupying most of Central and Eastern Europe, Stalin was at an advantage, and the two western leaders vied for his favors."
The differences between Roosevelt and Churchill led to several separate deals with the Soviets.
"In October 1944, Churchill traveled to Moscow and proposed the ""percentages agreement"" to divide Europe into respective spheres of influence, including giving Stalin predominance over Romania, Hungary, and Bulgaria and Churchill carte blanche over Greece."
This proposal was accepted by Stalin.
"At the Yalta Conference of February 1945, Roosevelt signed a separate deal with Stalin regarding Asia and refused to support Churchill on the issues of Poland and Reparations."
"Roosevelt ultimately approved the percentage agreement, but there was still apparently no firm consensus on the framework for a post-war settlement in Europe."
"However, it no longer included a plan to partition the country into several independent states."
"On 10 May 1945, President Truman signed the US occupation directive JCS 1067, which was in effect for over two years, and was enthusiastically supported by Stalin."
The Soviet Union was not allowed to participate and the dispute led to heated correspondence between Franklin Roosevelt and Stalin.
"Wolff, a war criminal, appears to have been guaranteed immunity at the Nuremberg trials by Office of Strategic Services (OSS) commander and future CIA director Allen Dulles when they met in March 1945."
"Accordingly, the UN was essentially converted into an inactive forum for exchanging polemical rhetoric, and the Soviets regarded it almost exclusively as a propaganda tribune."
"The Soviets pressed their demand made at Yalta, for $20 billion of reparations to be taken from Germany occupation zones."
"The Americans and British refused to fix a dollar amount for reparations, but they permitted the Soviets to remove some industry from their zones."
"Moreover, the participants' mounting antipathy and bellicose language served to confirm their suspicions about each other's hostile intentions, and to entrench their positions."
"Stalin was aware that the Americans were working on the atomic bomb, and he reacted to the news calmly."
"One week after the end of the Potsdam Conference, the US bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Shortly after the attacks, Stalin protested to US officials when Truman offered the Soviets little real influence in occupied Japan."
"Under the leadership of Lyuh Woon-Hyung, working secretly during Japanese occupation, committees throughout Korea formed to coordinate transition to Korean independence."
"Following Japanese surrender, on August 28, 1945 these committees formed the temporary national government of Korea, naming it the People's Republic of Korea (PRK) a couple of weeks later."
"On September 8, 1945, the United States government landed forces in Korea and thereafter established the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGK) to govern Korea south of the 38th parallel north."
"After World War II, US officials guided Western European leaders in establishing their own secret security force to prevent subversion in the Western bloc, which evolved into Operation Gladio."
The Truman Administration was receptive to the telegram due to broken promises by Stalin concerning Europe and Iran.
"Following the WWII Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, the country was occupied by the Red Army in the far north and the British in the south."
"Iran was used by the United States and British to supply the Soviet Union, and the Allies agreed to withdraw from Iran within six months after the cessation of hostilities."
"However, when this deadline came, the Soviets remained in Iran under the guise of the People's Republic of Azerbaijan and Kurdish Republic of Mahabad."
"Shortly thereafter, on 5 March, former British prime minister Winston Churchill delivered his famous ""Iron Curtain"" speech in Fulton, Missouri."
"He argued that there was nothing surprising in ""the fact that the Soviet Union, anxious for its future safety, [was] trying to see to it that governments loyal in their attitude to the Soviet Union should exist in these countries""."
"In September, the Soviet side produced the Novikov telegram, sent by the Soviet ambassador to the US but commissioned and ""co-authored"" by Vyacheslav Molotov; it portrayed the US as being in the grip of monopoly capitalists who were building up military capability ""to prepare the conditions for winning world supremacy in a new war""."
"In February 1947, the British government announced that it could no longer afford to finance the Kingdom of Greece in its civil war against Communist-led insurgents."
"The US government responded to this announcement by adopting a policy of containment, with the goal of stopping the spread of Communism."
"Truman delivered a speech calling for the allocation of $400 million to intervene in the war and unveiled the Truman Doctrine, which framed the conflict as a contest between free peoples and totalitarian regimes."
American policymakers accused the Soviet Union of conspiring against the Greek royalists in an effort to expand Soviet influence even though Stalin had told the Communist Party to cooperate with the British-backed government.
(The insurgents were helped by Josip Broz Tito's Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia against Stalin's wishes.
")Enunciation of the Truman Doctrine marked the beginning of a US bipartisan defense and foreign policy consensus between Republicans and Democrats focused on containment and deterrence that weakened during and after the Vietnam War, but ultimately persisted thereafter."
"Moderate and conservative parties in Europe, as well as social democrats, gave virtually unconditional support to the Western alliance, while European and American Communists, financed by the KGB and involved in its intelligence operations, adhered to Moscow's line, although dissent began to appear after 1956."
"Other critiques of the consensus policy came from anti-Vietnam War activists, the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, and the anti-nuclear movement."
"In June 1947, in accordance with the Truman Doctrine, the United States enacted the Marshall Plan, a pledge of economic assistance for all European countries willing to participate, including the Soviet Union."
"Later, the program led to the creation of the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation."
"The plan's aim was to rebuild the democratic and economic systems of Europe and to counter perceived threats to Europe's balance of power, such as communist parties seizing control through revolutions or elections."
The plan also stated that European prosperity was contingent upon German economic recovery.
"One month later, Truman signed the National Security Act of 1947, creating a unified Department of Defense, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), and the National Security Council (NSC)."
Stalin therefore prevented Eastern Bloc nations from receiving Marshall Plan aid.
"The Soviet Union's alternative to the Marshall Plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with central and eastern Europe, became known as the Molotov Plan (later institutionalized in January 1949 as the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance)."
"With the US assistance, the Greek military won its civil war."
Under the leadership of Alcide De Gasperi the Italian Christian Democrats defeated the powerful Communist–Socialist alliance in the elections of 1948.
"The most famous and active organizations were the American CIA, the Soviet KGB, and the British MI6."
"The East German Stasi, unlike the others, was primarily concerned with internal security, but its Main Directorate for Reconnaissance operated espionage activities around the world."
The CIA secretly subsidized and promoted anti-communist cultural activities and organizations.
"The CIA was also involved in European politics, especially in Italy."
"However, the Soviets probably had an advantage in terms of HUMINT (espionage) and ""sometimes in its reach into high policy circles."""
"Similarly, there is no evidence, on either side, of any major political or military decision that was prematurely discovered through espionage and thwarted by the other side."
"Until the break between Tito and Stalin, the Western powers and the Eastern bloc faced each other uncompromisingly."
"In addition to capitalism and communism, Italians and Slovenes, monarchists and republicans as well as war winners and losers often faced each other irreconcilably."
"The neutral buffer state Free Territory of Trieste, founded in 1947 with the United Nations, was split up and dissolved in 1954 and 1975, also because of the détente between the West and Tito."
"As part of the economic rebuilding of Germany, in early 1948, representatives of a number of Western European governments and the United States announced an agreement for a merger of western German areas into a federal governmental system."
"In addition, in accordance with the Marshall Plan, they began to re-industrialize and rebuild the west German economy, including the introduction of a new Deutsche Mark currency to replace the old Reichsmark currency that the Soviets had debased."
"The US had secretly decided that a unified and neutral Germany was undesirable, with Walter Bedell Smith telling General Eisenhower ""in spite of our announced position, we really do not want nor intend to accept German unification on any terms that the Russians might agree to, even though they seem to meet most of our requirements."
"""Shortly thereafter, Stalin instituted the Berlin Blockade (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), one of the first major crises of the Cold War, preventing food, materials and supplies from arriving in West Berlin."
The results effectively divided the city into East and West versions of its former self.
"300,000 Berliners demonstrated and urged the international airlift to continue, and US Air Force pilot Gail Halvorsen created ""Operation Vittles"", which supplied candy to German children."
Some sources dispute the sincerity of the proposal.
"That August, the first Soviet atomic device was detonated in Semipalatinsk, Kazakh SSR."
"Following Soviet refusals to participate in a German rebuilding effort set forth by western European countries in 1948, the US, Britain and France spearheaded the establishment of West Germany from the three Western zones of occupation in April 1949."
"Radio and television organizations were state-owned, while print media was usually owned by political organizations, mostly by the local communist party."
"Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, an alternative to the controlled and party-dominated domestic press."
"The United States, acting through the CIA, funded a long list of projects to counter the communist appeal among intellectuals in Europe and the developing world."
"In May 1953, Beria, by then in a government post, had made an unsuccessful proposal to allow the reunification of a neutral Germany to prevent West Germany's incorporation into NATO."
"According to Norwegian historian Odd Arne Westad, the communists won the Civil War because they made fewer military mistakes than Chiang Kai-Shek made, and because in his search for a powerful centralized government, Chiang antagonized too many interest groups in China."
"Moreover, his party was weakened during the war against Japan."
"Meanwhile, the communists told different groups, such as the peasants, exactly what they wanted to hear, and they cloaked themselves under the cover of Chinese nationalism."
Chiang and his KMT government retreated to the island of Taiwan.
"Confronted with the communist revolution in China and the end of the American atomic monopoly in 1949, the Truman administration quickly moved to escalate and expand its containment doctrine."
"In NSC 68, a secret 1950 document, the National Security Council instituted a Machiavellian policy  while proposing to reinforce pro-Western alliance systems and quadruple spending on defense."
"In this way, this US would exercise ""preponderant power,"" oppose neutrality, and establish global hegemony."
"In the early 1950s (a period sometimes known as the ""Pactomania""), the US formalized a series of alliances with Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Thailand and the Philippines (notably ANZUS in 1951 and SEATO in 1954), thereby guaranteeing the United States a number of long-term military bases."
"In June 1950, after years of mutual hostilities, Kim Il-sung's North Korean People's Army invaded South Korea at the 38th parallel."
Stalin had been reluctant to support the invasion but ultimately sent advisers.
"To Stalin's surprise, the United Nations Security Council Resolution 82 and 83 backed the defense of South Korea, although the Soviets were then boycotting meetings in protest of the fact that Taiwan, not the People's Republic of China, held a permanent seat on the council."
"A UN force of sixteen countries faced North Korea, although 40 percent of troops were South Korean, and about 50 percent were from the United States."
The US initially seemed to follow containment when it first entered the war.
This directed the US's action to only push back North Korea across the 38th Parallel and restore South Korea's sovereignty while allowing North Korea's survival as a state.
General Douglas MacArthur then advanced across the 38th Parallel into North Korea.
"Truman publicly hinted that he might use his ""ace in the hole"" of the atomic bomb, but Mao was unmoved."
The episode was used to support the wisdom of the containment doctrine as opposed to rollback.
"The Communists were later pushed to roughly around the original border, with minimal changes."
"Among other effects, the Korean War galvanised NATO to develop a military structure."
"In the South, the American-backed dictator Syngman Rhee ran a violently anticommunist and authoritarian regime."
"While Rhee was overthrown in 1960, South Korea continued to be ruled by a military government of former Japanese collaborators until the re-establishment of a multi-party system in the late 1980s."
"On 25 February 1956, Khrushchev shocked delegates to the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party by cataloguing and denouncing Stalin's crimes."
"As part of a new campaign of de-Stalinization, he declared that the only way to reform and move away from Stalin's policies would be to acknowledge errors made in the past."
"On 18 November 1956, while addressing Western dignitaries at a reception in Moscow's Polish embassy, Khrushchev infamously declared, ""Whether you like it or not, history is on our side."
"We will bury you"", shocking everyone present."
"He would later say he had not been referring to nuclear war, but the historically fated victory of communism over capitalism."
"Dulles also enunciated the doctrine of ""massive retaliation"", threatening a severe US response to any Soviet aggression."
"Possessing nuclear superiority, for example, allowed Eisenhower to face down Soviet threats to intervene in the Middle East during the 1956 Suez Crisis."
"The latter was disturbed by the U-2 spy plane scandal, however, in which Eisenhower was caught lying to the world about the intrusion of American surveillance aircraft into Soviet territory."
"The Soviets, who had already created a network of mutual assistance treaties in the Eastern Bloc by 1949, established a formal alliance therein, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955."
"In response to a popular uprising, the new regime formally disbanded the secret police, declared its intention to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact and pledged to re-establish free elections."
"Thousands of Hungarians were arrested, imprisoned and deported to the Soviet Union, and approximately 200,000 Hungarians fled Hungary in the chaos."
"He claimed that Soviet missile capabilities were far superior to those of the United States, capable of wiping out any American or European city."
"According to John Lewis Gaddis, Khrushchev rejected Stalin's ""belief in the inevitability of war,"" however."
"The new leader declared his ultimate goal was ""peaceful coexistence""."
"The communist parties in the West would never recover from the effect the Hungarian Revolution had on their membership, a fact that was immediately recognized by some, such as the Yugoslavian politician Milovan Đilas who shortly after the revolution was crushed said that ""The wound which the Hungarian Revolution inflicted on communism can never be completely healed""."
"He gave the United States, Great Britain, and France a six-month ultimatum to withdraw their troops from the sectors they still occupied in West Berlin, or he would transfer control of Western access rights to the East Germans."
"Khrushchev earlier explained to Mao Zedong that ""Berlin is the testicles of the West."
"Every time I want to make the West scream, I squeeze on Berlin."""
NATO formally rejected the ultimatum in mid-December and Khrushchev withdrew it in return for a Geneva conference on the German question.
"Like Truman and Eisenhower, Kennedy supported containment to stop the spread of Communism."
President Eisenhower's New Look policy had emphasized the use of less expensive nuclear weapons to deter Soviet aggression by threatening massive nuclear attacks all of the Soviet Union.
"Nuclear weapons were much cheaper than maintaining a large standing army, so Eisenhower cut conventional forces to save money."
Kennedy implemented a new strategy known as flexible response.
This strategy relied on conventional arms to achieve limited goals.
"As part of this policy, Kennedy expanded the United States special operations forces, elite military units that could fight unconventionally in various conflicts."
"He sought, and Congress provided, a rapid build-up of the nuclear arsenal to restore the lost superiority over the Soviet Union—he claimed in 1960 that Eisenhower had lost it because of excessive concern with budget deficits."
"In his inaugural address Kennedy promised ""to bear any burden"" in the defense of liberty, and he repeatedly asked for increases in military spending and authorization of new weapon systems."
"From 1961 to 1964 the number of nuclear weapons increased by 50 percent, as did the number of B-52 bombers to deliver them."
The new ICBM force grew from 63 intercontinental ballistic missiles to 424.
"He authorized 23 new Polaris submarines, each of which carried 16 nuclear missiles."
He called on cities to prepare fallout shelters for nuclear war.
"In contrast to Eisenhower's warning about the perils of the military-industrial complex, Kennedy focused on rearmament."
"In this context, the United States and the Soviet Union increasingly competed for influence by proxy in the Third World as decolonization gained momentum in the 1950s and early 1960s."
Both sides were selling armaments to gain influence.
The popularly elected Mosaddegh had been a Middle Eastern nemesis of Britain since nationalizing the British-owned Anglo-Iranian Oil Company in 1951.
"Winston Churchill told the United States that Mosaddegh was ""increasingly turning towards Communist influence."""
"The shah's policies included banning the communist Tudeh Party of Iran, and general suppression of political dissent by SAVAK, the shah's domestic security and intelligence agency."
"In Guatemala, a banana republic, the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'état ousted the left-wing President Jacobo Árbenz with material CIA support."
"After mediation failed, Sukarno took action to remove the dissident commanders."
"In February 1958, dissident military commanders in Central Sumatera (Colonel Ahmad Hussein) and North Sulawesi (Colonel Ventje Sumual) declared the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia-Permesta Movement aimed at overthrowing the Sukarno regime."
"They were joined by many civilian politicians from the Masyumi Party, such as Sjafruddin Prawiranegara, who were opposed to the growing influence of the communist Partai Komunis Indonesia party."
"Due to their anti-communist rhetoric, the rebels received arms, funding, and other covert aid from the CIA until Allen Lawrence Pope, an American pilot, was shot down after a bombing raid on government-held Ambon in April 1958."
The central government responded by launching airborne and seaborne military invasions of rebel strongholds Padang and Manado.
"By the end of 1958, the rebels were militarily defeated, and the last remaining rebel guerilla bands surrendered by August 1961."
"In the Republic of the Congo, newly independent from Belgium since June 1960, the CIA-cultivated President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the dismissal of the democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September."
"Embarrassed by the landslide electoral victory of Jagan's allegedly Marxist party, the British imprisoned the PPP's leadership and maneuvered the organization into a divisive rupture in 1955, engineering a split between Jagan and his PPP colleagues."
"In the Geneva Conference, peace accords were signed, leaving Vietnam divided between a pro-Soviet administration in North Vietnam and a pro-Western administration in South Vietnam at the 17th parallel north."
"In 1955, at the Bandung Conference in Indonesia, dozens of Third World governments resolved to stay out of the Cold War."
The consensus reached at Bandung culminated with the creation of the Belgrade-headquartered Non-Aligned Movement in 1961.
"Meanwhile, Khrushchev broadened Moscow's policy to establish ties with India and other key neutral states."
Independence movements in the Third World transformed the post-war order into a more pluralistic world of decolonized African and Middle Eastern nations and of rising nationalism in Asia and Latin America.
"Mao had defended Stalin when Khrushchev criticized him in 1956, and treated the new Soviet leader as a superficial upstart, accusing him of having lost his revolutionary edge."
The Chinese-Soviet animosity spilled out in an intra-communist propaganda war.
"Further on, the Soviets focused on a bitter rivalry with Mao's China for leadership of the global communist movement."
"The split helped to determine the framework of the Second Cold War in general, and influenced the course of the Second Vietnam War in particular."
"In August 1957, the Soviets successfully launched the world's first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), and in October they launched the first Earth satellite, Sputnik 1."
The launch of Sputnik inaugurated the Space Race.
"This led to the Apollo Moon landings by the United States, which astronaut Frank Borman later described as ""just a battle in the Cold War."""
Cuba began negotiating for arms purchases from the Eastern Bloc in March 1960.
"Castro responded by publicly embracing Marxism–Leninism, and the Soviet Union pledged to provide further support."
"By the early 1950s, the Soviet approach to restricting emigration movement was emulated by most of the rest of the Eastern Bloc."
"That June, the Soviet Union issued a new ultimatum demanding the withdrawal of Allied forces from West Berlin."
"The request was rebuffed, and on 13 August, East Germany erected a barbed-wire barrier that would eventually be expanded through construction into the Berlin Wall, effectively closing the loophole."
"Significant hopes were pinned on the program of terrorist attacks and other destabilisation operations known as Operation Mongoose, devised under the Kennedy administration in 1961."
"He ultimately responded to the installation of nuclear missiles in Cuba with a naval blockade, and he presented an ultimatum to the Soviets."
"Khrushchev backed down from a confrontation, and the Soviet Union removed the missiles in return for a public American pledge not to invade Cuba again as well as a covert deal to remove US missiles from Turkey."
"Castro later admitted that ""I would have agreed to the use of nuclear weapons."
"""The Cuban Missile Crisis (October–November 1962) brought the world closer to nuclear war than ever before."
"Accused of rudeness and incompetence, John Lewis Gaddis argues that Krhuschev was also credited with ruining Soviet agriculture, bringing the world to the brink of nuclear war and that Khrushchev had become an 'international embarrassment' when he authorized construction of the Berlin Wall."
"Meanwhile, Moscow was forced to turn its attention inward to deal with the Soviet Union's deep-seated domestic economic problems."
"During this period, Soviet leaders such as Leonid Brezhnev and Alexei Kosygin embraced the notion of détente."
South Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem's heavy-handed crackdown on Buddhist monks in 1963 led the US to endorse a deadly military coup against Diem.
"Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev responded by reversing Khrushchev's policy of disengagement and increasing aid to the North Vietnamese, hoping to entice the North from its pro-Chinese position."
"The USSR discouraged further escalation of the war, however, providing just enough military assistance to tie up American forces."
Despite years of American tutelage and aid the South Vietnamese forces were unable to withstand the communist offensive and the task fell to US forces instead.
"Tet showed that the end of US involvement was not in sight, increasing domestic skepticism of the war and giving rise to what was referred to as the Vietnam Syndrome, a public aversion to American overseas military involvements."
De Gaulle protested at the strong role of the United States in the organization and what he perceived as a special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom.
"De Gaulle considered the response he received to be unsatisfactory, and began the development of an independent French nuclear deterrent."
In 1966 he withdrew France from NATO's military structures and expelled NATO troops from French soil.
"The invasion was followed by a wave of emigration, including an estimated 70,000 Czechs and Slovaks initially fleeing, with the total eventually reaching 300,000."
"The invasion sparked intense protests from Yugoslavia, Romania, China, and from Western European communist parties."
"The doctrine found its origins in the failures of Marxism–Leninism in states like Poland, Hungary and East Germany, which were facing a declining standard of living contrasting with the prosperity of West Germany and the rest of Western Europe."
"In 1964, the Brazilian military overthrew the government of president João Goulart with US backing."
"In late April 1965, the US sent some 22,000 troops to the Dominican Republic for a one-year occupation in an invasion codenamed Operation Power Pack, citing the threat of the emergence of a Cuban-style revolution in Latin America."
"Héctor García-Godoy acted as provisional president, until conservative former president Joaquín Balaguer won the 1966 presidential election against non-campaigning former President Juan Bosch."
Activists for Bosch's Dominican Revolutionary Party were violently harassed by the Dominican police and armed forces.
"In Indonesia, the hardline anti-communist General Suharto wrested control of the state from his predecessor Sukarno in an attempt to establish a ""New Order""."
"From 1965 to 1966, with the aid of the United States and other Western governments, the military led the mass killing of more than 500,000 members and sympathizers of the Indonesian Communist Party and other leftist organizations, and detained hundreds of thousands more in prison camps around the country under extremely inhumane conditions."
"A top-secret CIA report stated that the massacres ""rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s."""
The Middle East remained a source of contention.
"Egypt, which received the bulk of its arms and economic assistance from the USSR, was a troublesome client, with a reluctant Soviet Union feeling obliged to assist in both the 1967 Six-Day War (with advisers and technicians) and the War of Attrition (with pilots and aircraft) against pro-Western Israel."
"Despite the beginning of an Egyptian shift from a pro-Soviet to a pro-American orientation in 1972 (under Egypt's new leader Anwar Sadat), rumors of imminent Soviet intervention on the Egyptians' behalf during the 1973 Yom Kippur War brought about a massive American mobilization that threatened to wreck détente."
"Although pre-Sadat Egypt had been the largest recipient of Soviet aid in the Middle East, the Soviets were also successful in establishing close relations with communist South Yemen, as well as the nationalist governments of Algeria and Iraq."
Iraq signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the Soviet Union in 1972.
"It appeared that any enemy of the Baghdad regime was a potential ally of the United States."""
"In response, the US covertly financed Kurdish rebels led by Mustafa Barzani during the Second Iraqi–Kurdish War; the Kurds were defeated in 1975, leading to the forcible relocation of hundreds of thousands of Kurdish civilians."
"Around June 1977, Somali troops occupied the Ogaden and began advancing inland towards Ethiopian positions in the Ahmar Mountains."
"Both countries were client states of the Soviet Union; Somalia was led by self-proclaimed Marxist military leader Siad Barre, and Ethiopia was controlled by the Derg, a cabal of military generals loyal to the pro-Soviet Mengistu Haile Mariam, who had declared the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia in 1975."
"The Soviets initially attempted to exert a moderating influence on both states, but in November 1977 Barre broke off relations with Moscow and expelled his Soviet military advisers."
"He then turned to the China and Safari Club—a group of pro-American intelligence agencies including those of Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia—for support and weapons."
"While declining to take a direct part in hostilities, the Soviet Union did provide the impetus for a successful Ethiopian counteroffensive to expel Somalia from the Ogaden."
"The counteroffensive was planned at the command level by Soviet advisers attached to the Ethiopian general staff, and bolstered by the delivery of millions of dollars' of sophisticated Soviet arms."
"About 11,000 Cuban troops spearheaded the primary effort, after receiving a hasty training on some of the newly delivered Soviet weapons systems by East German instructors."
"In Chile, the Socialist Party candidate Salvador Allende won the presidential election of 1970, thereby becoming the first democratically elected Marxist to become president of a country in the Americas."
"The CIA targeted Allende for removal and operated to undermine his support domestically, which contributed to a period of unrest culminating in General Augusto Pinochet's coup d'état on 11 September 1973."
"Pinochet consolidated power as a military dictator, Allende's reforms of the economy were rolled back, and leftist opponents were killed or detained in internment camps under the Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional (DINA)."
The Socialist states—with the exception of China and Romania—broke off relations with Chile.
"The Pinochet regime would go on to be one of the leading participants in Operation Condor, an international campaign of political assassination and state terrorism organized by right-wing military dictatorships in the Southern Cone of South America that was covertly supported by the US government."
"On 24 April 1974, the Carnation Revolution succeeded in ousting Marcelo Caetano and Portugal's right-wing Estado Novo government, sounding the death knell for the Portuguese Empire."
"Independence was hastily granted to a number of Portuguese colonies, including Angola, where the disintegration of colonial rule was followed by a violent civil war."
"There were three rival militant factions competing for power in Angola, the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and the National Liberation Front of Angola (FNLA)."
"While all three had socialist leanings, the MPLA was the only party with close ties to the Soviet Union."
"Its adherence to the concept of a one-party state alienated it from the FNLA and UNITA, which began portraying themselves as anti-communist and pro-Western in orientation."
"When the Soviets began supplying the MPLA with arms, the CIA and China offered substantial covert aid to the FNLA and UNITA."
"The MPLA eventually requested direct military support from Moscow in the form of ground troops, but the Soviets declined, offering to send advisers but no combat personnel."
Cuba was more forthcoming and began amassing troops in Angola to assist the MPLA.
By November 1975 there were over a thousand Cuban soldiers in the country.
"The persistent buildup of Cuban troops and Soviet weapons allowed the MPLA to secure victory and blunt an abortive intervention by Zairean and South African troops, which had deployed in a belated attempt to assist the FNLA and UNITA."
"During the Vietnam War, North Vietnam used border areas of Cambodia as military bases, which Cambodian head of state Norodom Sihanouk tolerated in an attempt to preserve Cambodia's neutrality."
"Following Sihanouk's March 1970 deposition by pro-American general Lon Nol, who ordered the North Vietnamese to leave Cambodia, North Vietnam attempted to overrun all of Cambodia following negotiations with Nuon Chea, the second-in-command of the Cambodian communists (dubbed the Khmer Rouge) fighting to overthrow the Cambodian government."
Sihanouk fled to China with the establishment of the GRUNK in Beijing.
"American and South Vietnamese forces responded to these actions with a bombing campaign and a brief ground incursion, which contributed to the violence of the civil war that soon enveloped all of Cambodia."
"Martin Shaw described these atrocities as ""the purest genocide of the Cold War era."""
"Backed by the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation, an organization of Khmer pro-Soviet Communists and Khmer Rouge defectors led by Heng Samrin, Vietnam invaded Cambodia on 22 December 1978."
"The invasion succeeded in deposing Pol Pot, but the new state would struggle to gain international recognition beyond the Soviet Bloc sphere, despite the previous international outcry at the Pol Pot regime's gross human rights violations, representatives of Khmer Rouge were allowed to be seated in the UN General Assembly, with strong support from China and Western powers, the member countries of ASEAN, and it would become bogged down in a guerrilla war led from refugee camps located on the border with Thailand."
"Following the destruction of Khmer Rouge, the national reconstruction of Cambodia would be severely hampered, and Vietnam would suffer a punitive Chinese attack."
The Chinese had sought improved relations with the Americans in order to gain advantage over the Soviets as well.
"In February 1972, Nixon achieved a stunning rapprochement with China, traveling to Beijing and meeting with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai."
"These Strategic Arms Limitation Talks resulted in two landmark arms control treaties: SALT I, the first comprehensive limitation pact signed by the two superpowers, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned the development of systems designed to intercept incoming missiles."
"Meanwhile, Brezhnev attempted to revive the Soviet economy, which was declining in part because of heavy military expenditures."
"Between 1972 and 1974, the two sides also agreed to strengthen their economic ties, including agreements for increased trade."
"Other agreements were concluded to stabilize the situation in Europe, culminating in the Helsinki Accords signed at the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in 1975."
"Kissinger and Nixon were ""realists"" who deemphasized idealistic goals like anti-communism or promotion of democracy worldwide, because those goals were too expensive in terms of America's economic capabilities."
"Instead of a Cold War they wanted peace, trade and cultural exchanges."
"They realized that Americans were no longer willing to tax themselves for idealistic foreign policy goals, especially for containment policies that never seemed to produce positive results."
"Instead Nixon and Kissinger sought to downsize America's global commitments in proportion to its reduced economic, moral and political power."
"They rejected ""idealism"" as impractical and too expensive, and neither man showed much sensitivity to the plight of people living under Communism."
"Kissinger's realism fell out of fashion as idealism returned to American foreign policy with Carter's moralism emphasizing human rights, and Reagan's rollback strategy aimed at destroying Communism."
Tensions greatly increased between the major powers with both sides becoming more militant.
"Diggins says, ""Reagan went all out to fight the second cold war, by supporting counterinsurgencies in the third world."""
"Cox says, ""The intensity of this 'second' Cold War was as great as its duration was short."""
"Within months, opponents of the communist government launched an uprising in eastern Afghanistan that quickly expanded into a civil war waged by guerrilla mujahideen against government forces countrywide."
"The Islamic Unity of Afghanistan Mujahideen insurgents received military training and weapons in neighboring Pakistan and China, while the Soviet Union sent thousands of military advisers to support the PDPA government."
"Meanwhile, increasing friction between the competing factions of the PDPA—the dominant Khalq and the more moderate Parcham—resulted in the dismissal of Parchami cabinet members and the arrest of Parchami military officers under the pretext of a Parchami coup."
"Distrusted by the Soviets, Amin was assassinated by Soviet special forces in December 1979."
"A Soviet-organized government, led by Parcham's Babrak Karmal but inclusive of both factions, filled the vacuum."
"Soviet troops were deployed to stabilize Afghanistan under Karmal in more substantial numbers, although the Soviet government did not expect to do most of the fighting in Afghanistan."
"He described the Soviet incursion as ""the most serious threat to the peace since the Second World War""."
"In 1980, Ronald Reagan defeated Jimmy Carter in the 1980 presidential election, vowing to increase military spending and confront the Soviets everywhere."
Both Reagan and new British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher denounced the Soviet Union and its ideology.
"Reagan labeled the Soviet Union an ""evil empire"" and predicted that Communism would be left on the ""ash heap of history,"" while Thatcher inculpated the Soviets as ""bent on world dominance."""
"In 1982, Reagan tried to cut off Moscow's access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to Western Europe."
"It hurt the Soviet economy, but it also caused ill will among American allies in Europe who counted on that revenue."
"Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union."
"Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims from around the world to participate in the jihad against the Soviet Union."
"In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski reacted to the crisis by imposing a period of martial law."
Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response.
"Mikhail Suslov, the Kremlin's top ideologist, advised Soviet leaders not to intervene if Poland fell under the control of Solidarity, for fear it might lead to heavy economic sanctions, resulting in a catastrophe for the Soviet economy."
"Soviet spending on the arms race and other Cold War commitments both caused and exacerbated deep-seated structural problems in the Soviet system, which experienced at least a decade of economic stagnation during the late Brezhnev years."
"Soviet investment in the defense sector was not driven by military necessity, but in large part by the interests of massive party and state bureaucracies dependent on the sector for their own power and privileges."
"The Soviet Armed Forces became the largest in the world in terms of the numbers and types of weapons they possessed, in the number of troops in their ranks, and in the sheer size of their military–industrial base."
"However, the quantitative advantages held by the Soviet military often concealed areas where the Eastern Bloc dramatically lagged behind the West."
"For example, the Persian Gulf War demonstrated how the armor, fire control systems and firing range of the Soviet Union's most common main battle tank, the T-72, were drastically inferior to the American M1 Abrams, yet the USSR fielded almost three times as many T-72s as the US deployed M1s."
"By the early 1980s, the USSR had built up a military arsenal and army surpassing that of the United States."
"Soon after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, president Carter began massively building up the United States military."
"The Soviets deployed RSD-10 Pioneer ballistic missiles targeting Western Europe, and NATO decided, under the impetus of the Carter presidency, to deploy MGM-31 Pershing and cruise missiles in Europe, primarily West Germany."
"At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production."
"These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union as oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues."
"Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought the Soviet economy to stagnation."
"On 1 September 1983, the Soviet Union shot down Korean Air Lines Flight 007, a Boeing 747 with 269 people aboard, including sitting Congressman Larry McDonald, an action which Reagan characterized as a ""massacre""."
"The airliner had violated Soviet airspace just past the west coast of Sakhalin Island near Moneron Island, and the Soviets treated the unidentified aircraft as an intruding US spy plane."
"The incident increased support for military deployment, overseen by Reagan, which stood in place until the later accords between Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev."
"The Reagan administration emphasized the use of quick, low-cost counter-insurgency tactics to intervene in foreign conflicts."
"In 1983, the Reagan administration intervened in the multisided Lebanese Civil War, invaded Grenada, bombed Libya and backed the Central American Contras, anti-communist paramilitaries seeking to overthrow the Soviet-aligned Sandinista government in Nicaragua."
"While Reagan's interventions against Grenada and Libya were popular in the United States, his backing of the Contra rebels was mired in controversy."
"Although Brezhnev was convinced in 1979 that the Soviet war in Afghanistan would be brief, Muslim guerrillas, aided by the US, China, Britain, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, waged a fierce resistance against the invasion."
"The Kremlin sent nearly 100,000 troops to support its puppet regime in Afghanistan, leading many outside observers to dub the war ""the Soviets' Vietnam""."
"However, Moscow's quagmire in Afghanistan was far more disastrous for the Soviets than Vietnam had been for the Americans because the conflict coincided with a period of internal decay and domestic crisis in the Soviet system."
"A senior US State Department official predicted such an outcome as early as 1980, positing that the invasion resulted in part from a ""domestic crisis within the Soviet system."
"We could be seeing a period of foreign movement at a time of internal decay""."
"Perestroika relaxed the production quota system, allowed private ownership of businesses and paved the way for foreign investment."
"Partly as a way to fight off internal opposition from party cliques to his reforms, Gorbachev simultaneously introduced glasnost, or openness, which increased freedom of the press and the transparency of state institutions."
Glasnost was intended to reduce the corruption at the top of the Communist Party and moderate the abuse of power in the Central Committee.
"Glasnost also enabled increased contact between Soviet citizens and the western world, particularly with the United States, contributing to the accelerating détente between the two nations."
"The first summit was held in November 1985 in Geneva, Switzerland."
"At one stage the two men, accompanied only by an interpreter, agreed in principle to reduce each country's nuclear arsenal by 50 percent."
"A second summit was held in October 1986 in Reykjavík, Iceland."
"Talks went well until the focus shifted to Reagan's proposed Strategic Defense Initiative, which Gorbachev wanted eliminated."
"The negotiations failed, but the third summit in 1987 led to a breakthrough with the signing of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF)."
"The INF treaty eliminated all nuclear-armed, ground-launched ballistic and cruise missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,500 kilometers (300 to 3,400 miles) and their infrastructure."
"During the following year it became apparent to the Soviets that oil and gas subsidies, along with the cost of maintaining massive troops levels, represented a substantial economic drain."
Bush declared the Cold War over at the Malta Summit.
"A year later, the two former rivals were partners in the Gulf War against Iraq (August 1990 – February 1991)."
"Grassroots organizations, such as Poland's Solidarity movement, rapidly gained ground with strong popular bases."
The Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 finally started a movement in Hungary that the rulers in the Eastern bloc could not stop.
It was the largest movement of refugees from East Germany since the Berlin Wall was built in 1961 and ultimately brought about the fall of the Iron Curtain.
"The patrons of the picnic, Otto von Habsburg and the Hungarian Minister of State Imre Pozsgay, saw the planned event as an opportunity to test Mikhail Gorbachev's reaction."
"The Austrian branch of the Paneuropean Union, which was then headed by Karl von Habsburg, distributed thousands of brochures inviting the GDR holidaymakers in Hungary to a picnic near the border at Sopron."
But with the mass exodus at the Pan-European Picnic the subsequent hesitant behavior of the Socialist Unity Party of East Germany and the non-interference of the Soviet Union broke the dams.
"Now tens of thousands of media-informed East Germans made their way to Hungary, which was no longer willing to keep its borders completely closed or to oblige its border troops to use armed force."
"In Czechoslovakia and East Germany, mass protests unseated entrenched communist leaders."
"The communist regimes in Bulgaria and Romania also crumbled, in the latter case as the result of a violent uprising."
"The 1989 revolutionary wave swept across Central and Eastern Europe and peacefully overthrew all of the Soviet-style Marxist–Leninist states: East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria; Romania was the only Eastern-bloc country to topple its communist regime violently and execute its head of state."
The USSR was fatally weakened by a failed coup in August 1991.
"A growing number of Soviet republics, particularly Russia, threatened to secede from the USSR."
"The Commonwealth of Independent States, created on 21 December 1991, was a successor entity to the Soviet Union."
"Bush expressed his emotions: ""The biggest thing that has happened in the world in my life, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War."""
The capitalist reforms culminated in a recession in the early 1990s more severe than the Great Depression as experienced by the United States and Germany.
Just a few places attempted to exclude even members of communist secret services from decision-making.
"After the introduction of lustration, demand for scapegoats has become relatively low, and former communists have been elected for high governmental and other administrative positions."
"After the initial desire ""to root out the reds"" came a realization that massive punishment is wrong and finding only some guilty is hardly justice."
"The urgency of the current economic problems of postcommunism makes the crimes of the communist past ""old news"" for many citizens."
Decommunization is believed to be a power game of elites.
"The difficulty of dislodging the social elite makes it require a totalitarian state to disenfranchise the ""enemies of the people"" quickly and efficiently and a desire for normalcy overcomes the desire for punitive justice."
"The post-Cold War world is considered to be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower."
"The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World War II—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which were in West Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea)."
"The Cold War also marked the zenith of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science."
"These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War."
Cumulative US military expenditures throughout the entire Cold War amounted to an estimated $8 trillion.
"Further nearly 100,000 Americans lost their lives in the Korean and Vietnam Wars."
Many of the economic and social tensions that were exploited to fuel Cold War competition in parts of the Third World remain acute.
"The breakdown of state control in a number of areas formerly ruled by communist governments produced new civil and ethnic conflicts, particularly in the former Yugoslavia."
"In Central and Eastern Europe, the end of the Cold War has ushered in an era of economic growth and an increase in the number of liberal democracies, while in other parts of the world, such as Afghanistan, independence was accompanied by state failure."
"The Cold War endures as a popular topic reflected extensively in entertainment media, and continuing to the present with numerous post-1991 Cold War-themed feature films, novels, television, and other media."
"In 2013, a KGB-sleeper-agents-living-next-door action drama series, The Americans, set in the early 1980s, was ranked No."
6 on the Metacritic annual Best New TV Shows list; its six-season run concluded in May 2018.
"In particular, historians have sharply disagreed as to who was responsible for the breakdown of Soviet–US relations after the Second World War; and whether the conflict between the two superpowers was inevitable, or could have been avoided."
"Historians commonly speak of three differing approaches to the study of the Cold War: ""orthodox"" accounts, ""revisionism"", and ""post-revisionism""."
"""Orthodox"" accounts place responsibility for the Cold War on the Soviet Union and its expansion further into Europe."
"""Revisionist"" writers place more responsibility for the breakdown of post-war peace on the United States, citing a range of US efforts to isolate and confront the Soviet Union well before the end of World War II."
"""Post-revisionists"" see the events of the Cold War as more nuanced, and attempt to be more balanced in determining what occurred during the Cold War."
"Environmental protection is the practice of protecting the natural environment by individuals, organizations and governments."
"This has been recognized, and governments have begun placing restraints on activities that cause environmental degradation."
"Since the 1960s, environmental movements have created more awareness of the multiple environmental problems."
"There is disagreement on the extent of the environmental impact of human activity, so protection measures are occasionally debated."
"For instance, in India, Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) has been working for environmental and forest protection since 1998."
A group of Green Volunteers gets a goal of Green India Clean India concept.
"CA Gajendra Kumar Jain a Chartered Accountant, is the founder of Environment Improvement Trust in Sojat city a small village of State of Rajasthan in India  In developing countries, such as Latin America, these agreements are more commonly used to remedy significant levels of non-compliance with mandatory regulation."
"Ideally, the decision-making processes under such an approach would be a collaborative approach to planning and decision making that involves a broad range of stakeholders across all relevant governmental departments, as well as industry representatives, environmental groups, and community."
"This approach ideally supports a better exchange of information, development of conflict-resolution strategies and improved regional conservation."
Religions also play an important role in the conservation of the environment.
"As a result of this, many attempts are made by countries to develop agreements that are signed by multiple governments to prevent damage or manage the impacts of human activity on natural resources."
"This can include agreements that impact factors such as climate, oceans, rivers and air pollution."
"These international environmental agreements are sometimes legally binding documents that have legal implications when they are not followed and, at other times, are more agreements in principle or are for use as codes of conduct."
"By the late 1960s, a growing environmental movement called for coordinated and institutionalized international cooperation."
"The landmark United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was held in Stockholm in 1972, establishing the concept of a right to a healthy environment."
It was followed by the creation of the United Nations Environment Programme later that year.
Some of the most well-known international agreements include the Kyoto Protocol of 1997 and the Paris Agreement of 2015.
"However, in its broadest sense, environmental protection may be seen to be the responsibility of all the people and not simply that of government."
"Decisions that impact the environment will ideally involve a broad range of stakeholders including industry, indigenous groups, environmental group and community representatives."
"Gradually, environmental decision-making processes are evolving to reflect this broad base of stakeholders and are becoming more collaborative in many countries."
"Almost 40% of the land has been established into a network of protected areas, including several national parks."
"In the year 1948, Serengeti has officially established the first national park for wild cats in East Africa."
"Since 1983, there has been a more broad-reaching effort to manage environmental issues at a national level, through the establishment of the National Environment Management Council (NEMC) and the development of an environmental act."
In 1998 Environment Improvement Trust (EIT) start working for environment & forest protection in India from a small city Sojat.
Founder of Environment Improvement Trust is CA Gajendra Kumar Jain working with volunteers.
Division of the biosphere is the main government body that oversees protection.
"It does this through the formulation of policy, coordinating and monitoring environmental issues, environmental planning and policy-oriented environmental research."
The National Environment Management Council (NEMC) is an institution that was initiated when the National Environment Management Act was first introduced in year 1983.
This council has the role to advise governments and the international community on a range of environmental issues.
"The Environmental Management Act, 2004, is the first comprehensive legal and institutional framework to guide environmental-management decisions."
"The policy tools that are parts of the act include the use of environmental-impact assessments, strategics environmental assessments, and taxation on pollution for specific industries and products."
"The effectiveness of shifting of this act will only become clear over time as concerns regarding its implementation become apparent based on the fact that, historically, there has been a lack of capacity to enforce environmental laws and a lack of working tools to bring environmental-protection objectives into practice."
"Following this, they began establishing environmental protection agencies and putting controls on some of its industrial waste."
China was one of the first developing countries to implement a sustainable development strategy.
In 1983 the State Council announced that environmental protection would be one of China's basic national policies and in 1984 the National Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA) was established.
"Following severe flooding of the Yangtze River basin in 1998, NEPA was upgraded to the State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) meaning that environmental protection was now being implemented at a ministerial level."
"In 2008, SEPA became known by its current name of Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China (MEP)."
Environmental pollution and ecological degradation has resulted in economic losses for China.
"However, the high economic growth has put immense pressure on its environment and the environmental challenges that China faces are greater than most countries."
In 2010 China was ranked 121st out of 163 countries on the Environmental Performance Index.
"The EU is active in the field of environmental policy, issuing directives such as those on environmental impact assessment and on access to environmental information for citizens in the member states."
"Under the Islamic Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, the member states join the Islamic Environment Ministers Conference in every two years, focusing on the importance of environment protection and sustainable development."
"There is an authorized state body, the Federal Ministry of Natural Resources and Ecology."
"However, there are a lot of environmental issues in Russia."
"The list includes six Latin American countries: Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru and Venezuela."
"Mexico and Brazil stand out among the rest because they have the largest area, population and number of species."
"These countries represent a major concern for environmental protection because they have high rates of deforestation, ecosystems loss, pollution, and population growth."
"It was first created in the year 1973 with the name Special Secretariat for the Environment (Secretaria Especial de Meio Ambiente), changing names several times, and adopting the final name in the year 1999."
"Three decades later, at the beginning of the 1970s, the Law to Prevent and Control Environmental Pollution was created (Ley para Prevenir y Controlar la Contaminación Ambiental)."
In the year 1972 was the first direct response from the federal government to address eminent health effects from environmental issues.
It established the administrative organization of the Secretariat for the Improvement of the Environment (Subsecretaría para el Mejoramiento del Ambiente) in the Department of Health and Welfare.
"The Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources (Secretaría del Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, SEMARNAT) is Mexico's environment ministry."
"Direct work and studies on national meteorological, climatological, hydrological, and geohydrological systems, and participate in international conventions on these subjects."
"More progressive environmental protection had it start in the 1960s and 1970s with major international programs such as the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment in 1972, the Environment Committee of the OECD in 1970, and the United Nations Environment Programme of 1972."
These events laid the foundations by increasing public awareness and support for regulation.
"State environmental legislation was irregular and deficient until the Australian Environment Council (AEC) and Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM) were established in 1972 and 1974, creating a forum to assist in coordinating environmental and conservation policies between states and neighbouring countries."
"It concerns matters of national and international environmental significance regarding flora, fauna, ecological communities and cultural heritage."
"It also has jurisdiction over any activity conducted by the Commonwealth, or affecting it, that has significant environmental impact."
Each state in Australia has its own environmental protection legislation and corresponding agencies.
"Their jurisdiction is similar and covers point-source pollution, such as from industry or commercial activities, land/water use, and waste management."
"Most protected lands are managed by states and territories with state legislative acts creating different degrees and definitions of protected areas such as wilderness, national land and marine parks, state forests, and conservation areas."
"States also create regulation to limit and provide general protection from air, water, and sound pollution."
"At a local level, each city or regional council has responsibility over issues not covered by state or national legislation."
"This includes non-point source, or diffuse pollution, such as sediment pollution from construction sites."
Australia ranks second place on the UN 2010 Human Development Index and one of the lowest debt to GDP ratios of the developed economies.
"This could be seen as coming at the cost of the environment, with Australia being the world leader in coal exportation and species extinctions."
Some have been motivated to proclaim it is Australia's responsibility to set the example of environmental reform for the rest of the world to follow.
At a regional level the regional councils administer the legislation and address regional environmental issues.
The pollution in Switzerland is mainly the pollution caused by vehicles and the litteration by tourists.
"All US states have their own state-level departments of environmental protection, which may issue regulations more stringent than the federal ones."
Books such as Antarctica and Blockade have environmental protection as subjects whereas The Lorax has become a popular metaphor for environmental protection.
"""The Limits of Trooghaft"" by Desmond Stewart is a short story that provides insight into human attitudes towards animals."
"Another book called The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury investigates issues such as bombs, wars, government control, and what effects these can have on the environment."
"Globalization, or globalisation (Commonwealth English; see spelling differences), is the process of interaction and integration among people, companies, and governments worldwide."
Globalization has accelerated since the 18th century due to advances in transportation and communication technology.
This increase in global interactions has caused a growth in international trade and the exchange of ideas and culture.
Globalization is primarily an economic process of interaction and integration that is associated with social and cultural aspects.
"However, disputes and diplomacy are also large parts of the history of globalization, and of modern globalization."
"Economically, globalization involves goods, services, data, technology, and the economic resources of capital."
The expansion of global markets liberalizes the economic activities of the exchange of goods and funds.
Removal of cross-border trade barriers has made the formation of global markets more feasible.
"The term globalization first appeared in the early 20th century (supplanting an earlier French term mondialization), developed its current meaning some time in the second half of the 20th century, and came into popular use in the 1990s."
"Environmental challenges such as global warming, cross-boundary water and air pollution, and over-fishing have been linked to globalization."
"Globalizing processes affect and are affected by business and work organization, economics, sociocultural resources, and the natural environment."
"Academic literature commonly divides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization, and political globalization."
"Over the next few decades, the term was occasionally used by other scholars and media, but it was not clearly defined."
"One of the first usages of the term in the meaning resembling the later, common usage was by French economist François Perroux in his essays from the early 1960s (in his French works he used the term mondialization (literary worldization), also translated as mundialization)."
Its antecedents date back to the great movements of trade and empire across Asia and the Indian Ocean from the 15th century onward.
"To the great chagrin of Reactionists, it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood."
All old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed.
"In The Consequences of Modernity, Anthony Giddens writes: ""Globalization can thus be defined as the intensification of worldwide social relations which link distant localities in such a way that local happenings are shaped by events occurring many miles away and vice versa."""
"In 1992, Roland Robertson, professor of sociology at the University of Aberdeen and an early writer in the field, described globalization as ""the compression of the world and the intensification of the consciousness of the world as a whole."
"Globalization can be on a continuum with the local, national and regional."
At one end of the continuum lie social and economic relations and networks which are organized on a local and/or national basis; at the other end lie social and economic relations and networks which crystallize on the wider scale of regional and global interactions.
Globalization can refer to those spatial-temporal processes of change which underpin a transformation in the organization of human affairs by linking together and expanding human activity across regions and continents.
"Without reference to such expansive spatial connections, there can be no clear or coherent formulation of this term."
"It pertains to the increasing ease with which somebody on one side of the world can interact, to mutual benefit, with somebody on the other side of the world."
"Manfred Steger, professor of global studies and research leader in the Global Cities Institute at RMIT University, identifies four main empirical dimensions of globalization: economic, political, cultural, and ecological."
A fifth dimension—the ideological—cutting across the other four.
"They note the term was used ""in education to describe the global life of the mind""; in international relations to describe the extension of the European Common Market, and in journalism to describe how the ""American Negro and his problem are taking on a global significance""."
They have also argued that four forms of globalization can be distinguished that complement and cut across the solely empirical dimensions.
"According to James, the oldest dominant form of globalization is embodied globalization, the movement of people."
"A second form is agency-extended globalization, the circulation of agents of different institutions, organizations, and polities, including imperial agents."
"Object-extended globalization, a third form, is the movement of commodities and other objects of exchange."
"He calls the transmission of ideas, images, knowledge, and information across world-space disembodied globalization, maintaining that it is currently the dominant form of globalization."
"He used ""political globalization"" to refer to the emergence of a transnational élite and a phasing out of the nation-state."
"Meanwhile, he used ""cultural globalization"" to reference the worldwide homogenization of culture."
"""Globophobia"" is used to refer to the fear of globalization, though it can also mean the fear of balloons."
Large-scale globalization began in the 19th century.
"The first is the idea of Eastern Origins, which shows how Western states have adapted and implemented learned principles from the East."
"Without the spread of traditional ideas from the East, Western globalization would not have emerged the way it did."
"The interactions of states were not on a global scale and most often were confined to Asia, North Africa, the Middle East, and certain parts of Europe."
"With early globalization, it was difficult for states to interact with others that were not within a close proximity."
"Eventually, technological advances allowed states to learn of others' existence and thus another phase of globalization can occur."
"The third has to do with inter-dependency, stability, and regularity."
"If a state is not dependent on another, then there is no way for either state to be mutually affected by the other."
"This is one of the driving forces behind global connections and trade; without either, globalization would not have emerged the way it did and states would still be dependent on their own production and resources to work."
This is one of the arguments surrounding the idea of early globalization.
"Because it predated the Great Divergence in the nineteenth century, where Western Europe pulled ahead of the rest of the world in terms of industrial production and economic output, archaic globalization was a phenomenon that was driven not only by Europe but also by other economically developed Old World centers such as Gujarat, Bengal, coastal China, and Japan."
The German historical economist and sociologist Andre Gunder Frank argues that a form of globalization began with the rise of trade links between Sumer and the Indus Valley Civilization in the third millennium BCE.
"This archaic globalization existed during the Hellenistic Age, when commercialized urban centers enveloped the axis of Greek culture that reached from India to Spain, including Alexandria and the other Alexandrine cities."
"Early on, the geographic position of Greece and the necessity of importing wheat forced the Greeks to engage in maritime trade."
Trade in ancient Greece was largely unrestricted: the state controlled only the supply of grain.
"Trade on the Silk Road was a significant factor in the development of civilizations from China, Indian subcontinent, Persia, Europe, and Arabia, opening long-distance political and economic interactions between them."
"Though silk was certainly the major trade item from China, common goods such as salt and sugar were traded as well; and religions, syncretic philosophies, and various technologies, as well as diseases, also traveled along the Silk Routes."
"In addition to economic trade, the Silk Road served as a means of carrying out cultural trade among the civilisations along its network."
"The movement of people, such as refugees, artists, craftsmen, missionaries, robbers, and envoys, resulted in the exchange of religions, art, languages, and new technologies."
"The term describes the phase of increasing trade links and cultural exchange that characterized the period immediately preceding the advent of high ""modern globalization"" in the late 19th century."
"This phase of globalization was characterized by the rise of maritime European empires, in the 15th and 17th centuries, first the Portuguese Empire (1415) followed by the Spanish Empire (1492), and later the Dutch and British Empires."
"The period is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Years' War, and the rise of newfound commodities—most particularly slave trade."
The Triangular Trade made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the Western Hemisphere.
"European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian, and Chinese merchants were all involved in early modern trade and communications, particularly in the Indian Ocean region."
Innovations in transportation technology reduced trade costs substantially.
"New industrial military technologies increased the power of European states and the United States, and allowed these powers to forcibly open up markets across the world and extend their empires."
Industrialization allowed standardized production of household items using economies of scale while rapid population growth created sustained demand for commodities.
"In the 19th century, steamships reduced the cost of international transportation significantly and railroads made inland transportation cheaper."
The transportation revolution occurred some time between 1820 and 1850.
More nations embraced international trade.
Globalization in this period was decisively shaped by nineteenth-century imperialism such as in Africa and Asia.
"Initially, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) led to a series of agreements to remove trade restrictions."
"GATT's successor was the World Trade Organization (WTO), which provided a framework for negotiating and formalizing trade agreements and a dispute resolution process."
The approach of using global agreements to advance trade stumbled with the failure of the Doha Development Round of trade negotiation.
"Many countries then shifted to bilateral or smaller multilateral agreements, such as the 2011 South Korea–United States Free Trade Agreement."
"Since the 1970s, aviation has become increasingly affordable to middle classes in developed countries."
Open skies policies and low-cost carriers have helped to bring competition to the market.
"In the 1990s, the growth of low-cost communication networks cut the cost of communicating between countries."
More work can be performed using a computer without regard to location.
"This included accounting, software development, and engineering design."
"Student exchange programs became popular after World War II, and are intended to increase the participants' understanding and tolerance of other cultures, as well as improving their language skills and broadening their social horizons."
Between 1963 and 2006 the number of students studying in a foreign country increased 9 times.
"Since the 1980s, modern globalization has spread rapidly through the expansion of capitalism and neoliberal ideologies."
"The implementation of neoliberal policies has allowed for the privatization of public industry, deregulation of laws or policies that interfered with the free flow of the market, as well as cut-backs to governmental social services."
These neoliberal policies were introduced to many developing countries in the form of structural adjustment programs (SAPs) that were implemented by the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
"These programs required that the country receiving monetary aid would open its markets to capitalism, privatize public industry, allow free trade, cut social services like healthcare and education and allow the free movement of giant multinational corporations."
These programs allowed the World Bank and the IMF to become global financial market regulators that would promote neoliberalism and the creation of free markets for multinational corporations on a global scale.
"In the late 19th and early 20th century, the connectedness of the world's economies and cultures grew very quickly."
"This slowed down from the 1910s onward due to the World Wars and the Cold War, but picked up again in the 1980s and 1990s."
The revolutions of 1989 and subsequent liberalization in many parts of the world resulted in a significant expansion of global interconnectedness.
The migration and movement of people can also be highlighted as a prominent feature of the globalization process.
"In the period between 1965 and 1990, the proportion of the labor force migrating approximately doubled."
Most migration occurred between the developing countries and least developed countries (LDCs).
As economic integration intensified workers moved to areas with higher wages and most of the developing world oriented toward the international market economy.
The collapse of the Soviet Union not only ended the Cold War's division of the world – it also left the United States its sole policeman and an unfettered advocate of free market.
"It also resulted in the growing prominence of attention focused on the movement of diseases, the proliferation of popular culture and consumer values, the growing prominence of international institutions like the UN, and concerted international action on such issues as the environment and human rights."
Growth of globalization has never been smooth.
"Whereas the globalization of business is centered around the diminution of international trade regulations as well as tariffs, taxes, and other impediments that suppresses global trade, economic globalization is the process of increasing economic integration between countries, leading to the emergence of a global marketplace or a single world market."
"Depending on the paradigm, economic globalization can be viewed as either a positive or a negative phenomenon."
Economic globalization comprises: globalization of production; which refers to the obtainment of goods and services from a particular source from locations around the globe to benefit from difference in cost and quality.
"Likewise, it also comprises globalization of markets; which is defined as the union of different and separate markets into a massive global marketplace."
An example of such standard is the intermodal container.
"Containerization dramatically reduced the costs of transportation, supported the post-war boom in international trade, and was a major element in globalization."
"International standards are set by the International Organization for Standardization, which is composed of representatives from various national standards organizations."
"A multinational corporation, or worldwide enterprise, is an organization that owns or controls the production of goods or services in one or more countries other than their home country."
Such agreements involve cooperation between at least two countries to reduce trade barriers –  import quotas and tariffs –  and to increase trade of goods and services with each other.
"If people are also free to move between the countries, in addition to a free-trade agreement, it would also be considered an open border."
"Arguably the most significant free-trade area in the world is the European Union, a politico-economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe."
The EU has developed European Single Market through a standardized system of laws that apply in all member states.
"EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market,Trade facilitation looks at how procedures and controls governing the movement of goods across national borders can be improved to reduce associated cost burdens and maximize efficiency while safeguarding legitimate regulatory objectives."
Global trade in services is also significant.
He believes that the global capital experienced today is due to a new and distinct form of globalization which began in the 1980s.
Robinson argues not only are economic activities expanded across national boundaries but also there is a transnational fragmentation of these activities.
One important aspect of Robinson's globalization theory is that production of goods are increasingly global.
"This means that one pair of shoes can be produced by six countries, each contributing to a part of the production process."
"This process is marked by the common consumption of cultures that have been diffused by the Internet, popular culture media, and international travel."
This has added to processes of commodity exchange and colonization which have a longer history of carrying cultural meaning around the globe.
The circulation of cultures enables individuals to partake in extended social relations that cross national and regional borders.
The creation and expansion of such social relations is not merely observed on a material level.
Cultural globalization involves the formation of shared norms and knowledge with which people associate their individual and collective cultural identities.
Intercultural communication is a related field of study.
"Cultural diffusion is the spread of cultural items—such as ideas, styles, religions, technologies, languages etc."
"Cultural globalization has increased cross-cultural contacts, but may be accompanied by a decrease in the uniqueness of once-isolated communities."
"For example, sushi is available in Germany as well as Japan, but Euro-Disney outdraws the city of Paris, potentially reducing demand for ""authentic"" French pastry."
"Globalization's contribution to the alienation of individuals from their traditions may be modest compared to the impact of modernity itself, as alleged by existentialists such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus."
"Globalization has expanded recreational opportunities by spreading pop culture, particularly via the Internet and satellite television."
"Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and more recently sects such as Mormonism are among those religions which have taken root and influenced endemic cultures in places far from their origins."
Globalization has strongly influenced sports.
"For example, the modern Olympic Games has athletes from more than 200 nations participating in a variety of competitions."
Cultural practices including traditional music can be lost or turned into a fusion of traditions.
Globalization can trigger a state of emergency for the preservation of musical heritage.
"Archivists may attempt to collect, record, or transcribe repertoires before melodies are assimilated or modified, while local musicians may struggle for authenticity and to preserve local musical traditions."
Globalization can lead performers to discard traditional instruments.
Music genres such as jazz and reggae began locally and later became international phenomena.
Globalization gave support to the world music phenomenon by allowing music from developing countries to reach broader audiences.
"Though the term ""World Music"" was originally intended for ethnic-specific music, globalization is now expanding its scope such that the term often includes hybrid subgenres such as ""world fusion"", ""global fusion"", ""ethnic fusion"", and worldbeat."
Bourdieu claimed that the perception of consumption can be seen as self-identification and the formation of identity.
"Musically, this translates into each individual having their own musical identity based on likes and tastes."
"These likes and tastes are greatly influenced by culture, as this is the most basic cause for a person's wants and behavior."
The concept of one's own culture is now in a period of change due to globalization.
"In 2002, China was the third largest exporter of cultural goods, after the UK and US."
"Between 1994 and 2002, both North America's and the European Union's shares of cultural exports declined while Asia's cultural exports grew to surpass North America."
Related factors are the fact that Asia's population and area are several times that of North America.
"Americanization is related to a period of high political American clout and of significant growth of America's shops, markets and objects being brought into other countries."
Some critics of globalization argue that it harms the diversity of cultures.
"As a dominating country's culture is introduced into a receiving country through globalization, it can become a threat to the diversity of local culture."
"Transcultural is in turn described as ""extending through all human cultures"" or ""involving, encompassing, or combining elements of more than one culture""."
"That system includes national governments, their governmental and intergovernmental organizations as well as government-independent elements of global civil society such as international non-governmental organizations and social movement organizations."
One of the key aspects of the political globalization is the declining importance of the nation-state and the rise of other actors on the political scene.
Multi-level governance gives expression to the idea that there are many interacting authority structures at work in the emergent global political economy.
It illuminates the intimate entanglement between the domestic and international levels of authority.
Some people are citizens of multiple nation-states.
"Multiple citizenship, also called dual citizenship or multiple nationality or dual nationality, is a person's citizenship status, in which a person is concurrently regarded as a citizen of more than one state under the laws of those states."
"Increasingly, non-governmental organizations influence public policy across national boundaries, including humanitarian aid and developmental efforts."
"Philanthropic organizations with global missions are also coming to the forefront of humanitarian efforts; charities such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Accion International, the Acumen Fund (now Acumen) and the Echoing Green have combined the business model with philanthropy, giving rise to business organizations such as the Global Philanthropy Group and new associations of philanthropists such as the Global Philanthropy Forum."
The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation projects include a current multibillion-dollar commitment to funding immunizations in some of the world's more impoverished but rapidly growing countries.
"For example, the North Korean government makes it very difficult for foreigners to enter the country and strictly monitors their activities when they do."
Aid workers are subject to considerable scrutiny and excluded from places and regions the government does not wish them to enter.
Citizens cannot freely leave the country.
"Despite a large proportion of women workers in the garment industry, women are still heavily underemployed compared to men."
Most women that are employed in the garment industry come from the countryside of Bangladesh triggering migration of women in search of garment work.
It is still unclear as to whether or not access to paid work for women where it didn't exist before has empowered them.
The answers varied depending on whether it is the employers perspective or the workers and how they view their choices.
Women workers did not see the garment industry as economically sustainable for them in the long run due to long hours standing and poor working conditions.
"Although women workers did show significant autonomy over their personal lives including their ability to negotiate with family, more choice in marriage, and being valued as a wage earner in the family."
Women in the maquiladora industry have produced high levels of turnover not staying long enough to be trained compared to men.
A gendered two tiered system within the maquiladora industry has been created that focuses on training and worker loyalty.
"Women are seen as being untrainable, placed in un-skilled, low wage jobs, while men are seen as more trainable with less turnover rates, and placed in more high skilled technical jobs."
The idea of training has become a tool used against women to blame them for their high turnover rates which also benefit the industry keeping women as temporary workers.
"Those dimensions, however, receive much less attention the three described above, as academic literature commonly subdivides globalization into three major areas: economic globalization, cultural globalization and political globalization."
The movement of tourists and business people opened up over the last century.
"As transportation technology improved, travel time and costs decreased dramatically between the 18th and early 20th century."
"For example, travel across the Atlantic ocean used to take up to 5 weeks in the 18th century, but around the time of the 20th century it took a mere 8 days."
"Today, modern aviation has made long-distance transportation quick and affordable."
Tourism is travel for pleasure.
"The developments in technology and transportation infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable."
At any given moment half a million people are in the air.
International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012.
"A visa is a conditional authorization granted by a country to a foreigner, allowing them to enter and temporarily remain within, or to leave that country."
International movement of labor is often seen as important to economic development.
"For example, freedom of movement for workers in the European Union means that people can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country."
Globalization is associated with a dramatic rise in international education.
More and more students are seeking higher education in foreign countries and many international students now consider overseas study a stepping-stone to permanent residency within a country.
"A variety of special issues arise in marriages between people from different countries, including those related to citizenship and culture, which add complexity and challenges to these kinds of relationships."
"In an age of increasing globalization, where a growing number of people have ties to networks of people and places across the globe, rather than to a current geographic location, people are increasingly marrying across national boundaries."
Transnational marriage is a by-product of the movement and migration of people.
Speed of global communications was limited by the maximum speed of courier services (especially horses and ships) until the mid-19th century.
The electric telegraph was the first method of instant long-distance communication.
"For example, before the first transatlantic cable, communications between Europe and the Americas took weeks because ships had to carry mail across the ocean."
"The first transatlantic cable reduced communication time considerably, allowing a message and a response in the same day."
Lasting transatlantic telegraph connections were achieved in the 1865–1866.
The first wireless telegraphy transmitters were developed in 1895.
The Internet has been instrumental in connecting people across geographical boundaries.
in different parts of the world are interrelated.
"possible to assume that global threats such as climate change precipitate the further establishment of global journalism."""
More than 180 countries have reported cases since then.
"This has caused a detrimental impact on the global economy, particularly for SME's and Microbusinesses with unlimited liability/self-employed, leaving them vulnerable to financial difficulties, increasing the market share for oligopolistic markets as well as increasing the barriers of entry."
"Measurements of economic globalization typically focus on variables such as trade, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), Gross Domestic Product (GDP), portfolio investment, and income."
"It shows that the depth of global integration fell by about one-tenth after 2008, but by 2013 had recovered well above its pre-crash peak."
The report also found a shift of economic activity to emerging economies.
Philosophical differences regarding the costs and benefits of such processes give rise to a broad-range of ideologies and social movements.
Globalization tends to bring people into contact with foreign people and cultures.
Xenophobia is the fear of that which is perceived to be foreign or strange.
"Xenophobia can manifest itself in many ways involving the relations and perceptions of an ingroup towards an outgroup, including a fear of losing identity, suspicion of its activities, aggression, and desire to eliminate its presence to secure a presumed purity."
Critiques of globalization generally stem from discussions surrounding the impact of such processes on the planet as well as the human costs.
"They challenge directly traditional metrics, such as GDP, and look to other measures, such as the Gini coefficient or the Happy Planet Index, and point to a ""multitude of interconnected fatal consequences–social disintegration, a breakdown of democracy, more rapid and extensive deterioration of the environment, the spread of new diseases, increasing poverty and alienation"" which they claim are the unintended consequences of globalization."
A 2005 study by Peer Fis and Paul Hirsch found a large increase in articles negative towards globalization in the years prior.
"In 1998, negative articles outpaced positive articles by two to one."
The number of newspaper articles showing negative framing rose from about 10% of the total in 1991 to 55% of the total in 1999.
"In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably."
"The main opposition consisted of socialists, environmental groups, and nationalists."
Residents of the EU did not appear to feel threatened by globalization in 2004.
The EU job market was more stable and workers were less likely to accept wage/benefit cuts.
Social spending was much higher than in the US.
"Their survey showed that, in 1993, more than 40% of respondents were unfamiliar with the concept of globalization."
"When the survey was repeated in 1998, 89% of the respondents had a polarized view of globalization as being either good or bad."
"At the same time, discourse on globalization, which began in the financial community before shifting to a heated debate between proponents and disenchanted students and workers."
Polarization increased dramatically after the establishment of the WTO in 1995; this event and subsequent protests led to a large-scale anti-globalization movement.
"Initially, college educated workers were likely to support globalization."
"Less educated workers, who were more likely to compete with immigrants and workers in developing countries, tended to be opponents."
The situation changed after the financial crisis of 2007.
"However, Japan was resource-poor and used exports to pay for its raw materials."
Anxiety over their position caused terms such as internationalization and globalization to enter everyday language.
Those opposing globalization typically combine environmental concerns with nationalism.
Opponents consider governments as agents of neo-colonialism that are subservient to multinational corporations.
Much of this criticism comes from the middle class; the Brookings Institution suggested this was because the middle class perceived upwardly mobile low-income groups as threatening to their economic security.
"Though it creates winners and losers, the broad consensus among economists is that free trade is a large and unambiguous net gain for society."
"In a survey of leading economists, none disagreed with the notion that ""freer trade improves productive efficiency and offers consumers better choices, and in the long run these gains are much larger than any effects on employment."""
"Most economists would agree that although increasing returns to scale might mean that certain industry could settle in a geographical area without any strong economic reason derived from comparative advantage, this is not a reason to argue against free trade because the absolute level of output enjoyed by both ""winner"" and ""loser"" will increase with the ""winner"" gaining more than the ""loser"" but both gaining more than before in an absolute level."
"In the book The End of Poverty, Jeffrey Sachs discusses how many factors can affect a country's ability to enter the world market, including government corruption; legal and social disparities based on gender, ethnicity, or caste; diseases such as AIDS and malaria; lack of infrastructure (including transportation, communications, health, and trade); unstable political landscapes; protectionism; and geographic barriers."
"However, economic growth does not necessarily mean a reduction in poverty; in fact, the two can coexist."
Economic growth is conventionally measured using indicators such as GDP and GNI that do not accurately reflect the growing disparities in wealth.
"Additionally, Oxfam International argues that poor people are often excluded from globalization-induced opportunities ""by a lack of productive assets, weak infrastructure, poor education and ill-health;"" effectively leaving these marginalized groups in a poverty trap."
Economist Paul Krugman is another staunch supporter of globalization and free trade with a record of disagreeing with many critics of globalization.
He argues that many of them lack a basic understanding of comparative advantage and its importance in today's world.
The flow of migrants to advanced economies has been claimed to provide a means through which global wages converge.
An IMF study noted a potential for skills to be transferred back to developing countries as wages in those a countries rise.
"Lastly, the dissemination of knowledge has been an integral aspect of globalization."
"Like this, the British economic journalist Martin Wolf says that incomes of poor developing countries, with more than half the world's population, grew substantially faster than those of the world's richest countries that remained relatively stable in its growth, leading to reduced international inequality and the incidence of poverty."
"Certain demographic changes in the developing world after active economic liberalization and international integration resulted in rising general welfare and, hence, reduced inequality."
"According to Wolf, in the developing world as a whole, life expectancy rose by four months each year after 1970 and infant mortality rate declined from 107 per thousand in 1970 to 58 in 2000 due to improvements in standards of living and health conditions."
"Also, adult literacy in developing countries rose from 53% in 1970 to 74% in 1998 and much lower illiteracy rate among the young guarantees that rates will continue to fall as time passes."
"Consequently, more prosperous and educated parents with fewer children have chosen to withdraw their children from the labor force to give them opportunities to be educated at school improving the issue of child labor."
"Thus, despite seemingly unequal distribution of income within these developing countries, their economic growth and development have brought about improved standards of living and welfare for the population as a whole."
"This rapid growth among the globalizers is not simply due to the strong performances of China and India in the 1980s and 1990s—18 out of the 24 globalizers experienced increases in growth, many of them quite substantial."
The globalization of the late 20th and early 21st centuries has led to the resurfacing of the idea that the growth of economic interdependence promotes peace.
They also claim that the increasing autonomy and strength of corporate entities shapes the political policy of countries.
They advocate global institutions and policies that they believe better address the moral claims of poor and working classes as well as environmental concerns.
Critics of globalization say that it disadvantages poorer countries.
"While it is true that free trade encourages globalization among countries, some countries try to protect their domestic suppliers."
The main export of poorer countries is usually agricultural productions.
"This would, in their view, bypass nation-states, corporate oligopolies, ideological non-governmental organizations (NGO), political cults and mafias."
One of its most prolific proponents is the British political thinker David Held.
"Advocates of democratic globalization argue that economic expansion and development should be the first phase of democratic globalization, which is to be followed by a phase of building global political institutions."
"A world confederation would not supersede the authority of the State governments but rather complement it, as both the States and the world authority would have power within their sphere of competence""."
The disseminators of the concept define it as the notion that we have certain rights and responsibilities towards each other by the mere fact of being human on Earth.
"World citizen has a variety of similar meanings, often referring to a person who disapproves of traditional geopolitical divisions derived from national citizenship."
"An early incarnation of this sentiment can be found in Socrates, whom Plutarch quoted as saying: ""I am not an Athenian, or a Greek, but a citizen of the world."""
"He proposes a process of ""universalization"" as an alternative."
Cosmopolitanism is the proposal that all human ethnic groups belong to a single community based on a shared morality.
A person who adheres to the idea of cosmopolitanism in any of its forms is called a cosmopolitan or cosmopolite.
"A cosmopolitan community might be based on an inclusive morality, a shared economic relationship, or a political structure that encompasses different nations."
nation-states) form relationships based on mutual respect.
"For instance, Kwame Anthony Appiah suggests the possibility of a cosmopolitan community in which individuals from varying locations (physical, economic, etc.)"
"enter relationships of mutual respect despite their differing beliefs (religious, political, etc."
His view suggested that globalization would lead to a world where people from all countries will become more integrated and aware of common interests and shared humanity.
"One example is the security cooperation between the United States and the former Soviet Union after the end of the Cold War, which astonished international society."
"Arms control and disarmament agreements, including the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (see START I, START II, START III, and New START) and the establishment of NATO's Partnership for Peace, the Russia NATO Council, and the G8 Global Partnership against the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass Destruction, constitute concrete initiatives of arms control and de-nuclearization."
The most recent debate around nuclear energy and the non-alternative coal-burning power plants constitutes one more consensus on what not to do.
"The back tracking of globalization has coined the term ""Slobalization."""
"Slobalization is a new, slower pattern of globalization."
"The movement is also commonly referred to as the alter-globalization movement, anti-globalist movement, anti-corporate globalization movement, or movement against neoliberal globalization."
Opponents of globalization argue that power and respect in terms of international trade between the developed and underdeveloped countries of the world are unequally distributed.
"For him, our epoch is determined by a social phenomenon: the revolt of the elites, in reference to The Revolt of the Masses (1929) by the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset."
"those who are in the top 20% in terms of income, through globalization which allows total mobility of capital, no longer live in the same world as their fellow-citizens."
"In this, they oppose the old bourgeoisie of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, which was constrained by its spatial stability to a minimum of rooting and civic obligations."
"Globalization, according to the sociologist, has turned elites into tourists in their own countries."
"Their ties to an international culture of work, leisure, information – make many of them deeply indifferent to the prospect of national decline."
"Instead of financing public services and the public treasury, new elites are investing their money in improving their voluntary ghettos: private schools in their residential neighborhoods, private police, garbage collection systems."
"Composed of those who control the international flows of capital and information, who preside over philanthropic foundations and institutions of higher education, manage the instruments of cultural production and thus fix the terms of public debate."
"So, the political debate is limited mainly to the dominant classes and political ideologies lose all contact with the concerns of the ordinary citizen."
The result of this is that no one has a likely solution to these problems and that there are furious ideological battles on related issues.
"However, they remain protected from the problems affecting the working classes: the decline of industrial activity, the resulting loss of employment, the decline of the middle class, increasing the number of the poor, the rising crime rate, growing drug trafficking, the urban crisis."
"All over the world, the movement has held protests outside meetings of institutions such as the WTO, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the World Economic Forum, and the Group of Eight (G8)."
Within the Seattle demonstrations the protesters that participated used both creative and violent tactics to gain the attention towards the issue of globalization.
Increasing integration of these financial markets between countries leads to the emergence of a global capital marketplace or a single world market.
"Common targets include the World Bank (WB), International Monetary Fund (IMF), the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Trade Organization (WTO) and free trade treaties like the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), the Multilateral Agreement on Investment (MAI) and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)."
"In light of the economic gap between rich and poor countries, movement adherents claim free trade without measures in place to protect the under-capitalized will contribute only to the strengthening the power of industrialized nations (often termed the ""North"" in opposition to the developing world's ""South"")."
The Corporation & Surplus) popularizing an anti-corporate ideology to the public.
"A related contemporary ideology, consumerism, which encourages the personal acquisition of goods and services, also drives globalization."
Anti-consumerism is a social movement against equating personal happiness with consumption and the purchase of material possessions.
"Concern over the treatment of consumers by large corporations has spawned substantial activism, and the incorporation of consumer education into school curricula."
"Social activists hold materialism is connected to global retail merchandizing and supplier convergence, war, greed, anomie, crime, environmental degradation, and general social malaise and discontent."
"One variation on this topic is activism by postconsumers, with the strategic emphasis on moving beyond addictive consumerism."
The movement is often labeled an anti-globalization movement by the mainstream media.
"Those involved, however, frequently deny that they are anti-globalization, insisting that they support the globalization of communication and people and oppose only the global expansion of corporate power."
"The movement is based in the idea of social justice, desiring the creation of a society or institution based on the principles of equality and solidarity, the values of human rights, and the dignity of every human being."
"Social inequality within and between nations, including a growing global digital divide, is a focal point of the movement."
"Many nongovernmental organizations have now arisen to fight these inequalities that many in Latin America, Africa and Asia face."
"A few very popular and well known non-governmental organizations (NGOs) include: War Child, Red Cross, Free The Children and CARE International."
"They often create partnerships where they work towards improving the lives of those who live in developing countries by building schools, fixing infrastructure, cleaning water supplies, purchasing equipment and supplies for hospitals, and other aid efforts."
"From around 1980 through at least 2011, the GDP gap, while still wide, appeared to be closing and, in some more rapidly developing countries, life expectancies began to rise."
"If we look at the Gini coefficient for world income, since the late 1980s, the gap between some regions has markedly narrowed—between Asia and the advanced economies of the West, for example—but huge gaps remain globally."
"Overall equality across humanity, considered as individuals, has improved very little."
"Within the decade between 2003 and 2013, income inequality grew even in traditionally egalitarian countries like Germany, Sweden and Denmark."
"With a few exceptions—France, Japan, Spain—the top 10 percent of earners in most advanced economies raced ahead, while the bottom 10 percent fell further behind."
Unions become less effective and workers their enthusiasm for unions when membership begins to decline.
They also cite an increase in the exploitation of child labor: countries with weak protections for children are vulnerable to infestation by rogue companies and criminal gangs who exploit them.
"Examples include quarrying, salvage, and farm work as well as trafficking, bondage, forced labor, prostitution and pornography."
"Women often participate in the workforce in precarious work, including export-oriented employment."
"Evidence suggests that while globalization has expanded women's access to employment, the long-term goal of transforming gender inequalities remains unmet and appears unattainable without regulation of capital and a reorientation and expansion of the state's role in funding public goods and providing a social safety net."
"Those who oppose global governance typically do so on objections that the idea is unfeasible, inevitably oppressive, or simply unnecessary."
"In general, these opponents are wary of the concentration of power or wealth that such governance might represent."
"Such reasoning dates back to the founding of the League of Nations and, later, the United Nations."
"Environmentalist concerns with globalization include issues such as global warming, global water supply and water crises, inequity in energy consumption and energy conservation, transnational air pollution and pollution of the world ocean, overpopulation, world habitat sustainability, deforestation, biodiversity loss and species extinction."
One critique of globalization is that natural resources of the poor have been systematically taken over by the rich and the pollution promulgated by the rich is systematically dumped on the poor.
Some argue that Northern corporations are increasingly exploiting resources of less wealthy countries for their global activities while it is the South that is disproportionately bearing the environmental burden of the globalized economy.
"In her book Ancient Futures, Norberg-Hodge claims that ""centuries of ecological balance and social harmony are under threat from the pressures of development and globalization."""
"She also criticizes the standardization and rationalization of globalization, as it does not always yield the expected growth outcomes."
This often comes at the cost of environmentally sound practices.
"Developing countries with cheap resources and labor tend to have less stringent environmental regulations, and conversely, nations with stricter environmental regulations become more expensive for companies as a result of the costs associated with meeting these standards."
"Thus, companies that choose to physically invest in foreign countries tend to (re)locate to the countries with the lowest environmental standards or weakest enforcement."
"The European Union–Mercosur Free Trade Agreement, which would form one of the world's largest free trade areas, has been denounced by environmental activists and indigenous rights campaigners."
The fear is that the deal could lead to more deforestation of the Amazon rainforest as it expands market access to Brazilian beef.
This is because crops are grown in countries with optimum growing conditions.
This improvement causes an increase in the world's food supply which encourages improved food security.
"The political movement 'BREXIT' was considered a step back in globalisation, it has greatly disrupted food chains within the UK as they import 26% of food produce from the EU."
The northernmost country in Europe requires trade with other countries to ensure population food demands are met.
The degree of self-sufficiency in food production is around 50% in Norway.
"Health care, health-care, or healthcare is the maintenance or improvement of health via the prevention, diagnosis, treatment, recovery, or cure of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental impairments in people."
Health care is delivered by health professionals and allied health fields.
"Medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, midwifery, nursing, optometry, audiology, psychology, occupational therapy, physical therapy, athletic training and other health professions are all part of health care."
"It includes work done in providing primary care, secondary care, and tertiary care, as well as in public health."
"Access to health care may vary across countries, communities, and individuals, influenced by social and economic conditions as well as health policies."
"Providing health care services means ""the timely use of personal health services to achieve the best possible health outcomes""."
"Limitations to health care services affects negatively the use of medical services, the efficacy of treatments, and overall outcome (well-being, mortality rates)."
Health care systems are organizations established to meet the health needs of targeted populations.
Health care is conventionally regarded as an important determinant in promoting the general physical and mental health and well-being of people around the world.
"An example of this was the worldwide eradication of smallpox in 1980, declared by the WHO as the first disease in human history to be eliminated by deliberate health care interventions."
"This includes professionals in medicine, psychology, physiotherapy, nursing, dentistry, midwifery and allied health, along with many others such as public health practitioners, community health workers and assistive personnel, who systematically provide personal and population-based preventive, curative and rehabilitative care services."
"While the definitions of the various types of health care vary depending on the different cultural, political, organizational and disciplinary perspectives, there appears to be some consensus that primary care constitutes the first element of a continuing health care process and may also include the provision of secondary and tertiary levels of care."
Health care can be defined as either public or private.
"Such a professional would usually be a primary care physician, such as a general practitioner or family physician."
"Another professional would be a licensed independent practitioner such as a physiotherapist, or a non-physician primary care provider such as a physician assistant or nurse practitioner."
"Depending on the locality, health system organization the patient may see another health care professional first, such as a pharmacist or nurse."
"Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may be referred for secondary or tertiary care."
Primary care is often used as the term for the health care services that play a role in the local community.
"It can be provided in different settings, such as Urgent care centers that provide same-day appointments or services on a walk-in basis."
"Primary care involves the widest scope of health care, including all ages of patients, patients of all socioeconomic and geographic origins, patients seeking to maintain optimal health, and patients with all types of acute and chronic physical, mental and social health issues, including multiple chronic diseases."
"Consequently, a primary care practitioner must possess a wide breadth of knowledge in many areas."
"Continuity is a key characteristic of primary care, as patients usually prefer to consult the same practitioner for routine check-ups and preventive care, health education, and every time they require an initial consultation about a new health problem."
"Primary care also includes many basic maternal and child health care services, such as family planning services and vaccinations."
"Physicians in this model bill patients directly for services, either on a pre-paid monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, or bill for each service in the office."
Examples of direct primary care practices include Foundation Health in Colorado and Qliance in Washington.
"In context of global population aging, with increasing numbers of older adults at greater risk of chronic non-communicable diseases, rapidly increasing demand for primary care services is expected in both developed and developing countries."
The World Health Organization attributes the provision of essential primary care as an integral component of an inclusive primary health care strategy.
This care is often found in a hospital emergency department.
"However, many secondary care providers, such as psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, occupational therapists, most dental specialties or physiotherapists, do not necessarily work in hospitals."
Some primary care services are delivered within hospitals.
This restriction may be imposed under the terms of the payment agreements in private or group health insurance plans.
"In other cases, medical specialists may see patients without a referral, and patients may decide whether self-referral is preferred."
"In other countries patient self-referral to a medical specialist for secondary care is rare as prior referral from another physician (either a primary care physician or another specialist) is considered necessary, regardless of whether the funding is from private insurance schemes or national health insurance."
"Allied health professionals, such as physical therapists, respiratory therapists, occupational therapists, speech therapists, and dietitians, also generally work in secondary care, accessed through either patient self-referral or through physician referral."
Experimental medicine and some types of uncommon diagnostic or surgical procedures are considered quaternary care.
These services are usually only offered in a limited number of regional or national health care centers.
"They include many interventions of public health interest, such as food safety surveillance, distribution of condoms and needle-exchange programs for the prevention of transmissible diseases."
"They also include the services of professionals in residential and community settings in support of self-care, home care, long-term care, assisted living, treatment for substance use disorders among other types of health and social care services."
Community rehabilitation services can assist with mobility and independence after the loss of limbs or loss of function.
"This can include prostheses, orthotics, or wheelchairs."
"Many countries, especially in the west, are dealing with aging populations, so one of the priorities of the health care system is to help seniors live full, independent lives in the comfort of their own homes."
There is an entire section of health care geared to providing seniors with help in day-to-day activities at home such as transportation to and from doctor's appointments along with many other activities that are essential for their health and well-being.
"Although they provide home care for older adults in cooperation, family members and care workers may harbor diverging attitudes and values towards their joint efforts."
"This information is translated into report cards that are generated by quality organizations, nonprofit, consumer groups and media."
"As a basic framework for defining the sector, the United Nations' International Standard Industrial Classification categorizes health care as generally consisting of hospital activities, medical and dental practice activities, and ""other human health activities."""
"The last class involves activities of, or under the supervision of, nurses, midwives, physiotherapists, scientific or diagnostic laboratories, pathology clinics, residential health facilities, patient advocates or other allied health professions."
"In addition, according to industry and market classifications, such as the Global Industry Classification Standard and the Industry Classification Benchmark, health care includes many categories of medical equipment, instruments and services including biotechnology, diagnostic laboratories and substances, drug manufacturing and delivery."
"For example, pharmaceuticals and other medical devices are the leading high technology exports of Europe and the United States."
"The United States dominates the biopharmaceutical field, accounting for three-quarters of the world's biotechnology revenues."
"Many important advances have been made through health research, biomedical research and pharmaceutical research, which form the basis for evidence-based medicine and evidence-based practice in health care delivery."
"Health care research frequently engages directly with patients, and as such issues for who to engage and how to engage with them become important to consider when seeking to actively include them in studies."
Results from health services research often form the basis of evidence-based policy in health care systems.
"Health services research is also aided by initiatives in the field of artificial intelligence for the development of systems of health assessment that are clinically useful, timely, sensitive to change, culturally sensitive, low-burden, low-cost, built into standard procedures, and involve the patient."
"Aside from financing mechanisms, an important question should always be how much to spend on healthcare."
"For the purposes of comparison, this is often expressed as the percentage of GDP spent on healthcare."
A similar correlation is seen from the analysis carried out each year by Bloomberg.
"Clearly this kind of analysis is flawed in that life expectancy is only one measure of a health system's performance, but equally, the notion that more funding is better is not supported."
"All OECD countries have achieved universal (or almost universal) health coverage, except the US and Mexico."
"In the United States, where around 18% of GDP is spent on health care, the Commonwealth Fund analysis of spend and quality shows a clear correlation between worse quality and higher spending."
"In particular, the practice of health professionals and the operation of health care institutions is typically regulated by national or state/provincial authorities through appropriate regulatory bodies for purposes of quality assurance."
Most countries have credentialing staff in regulatory boards or health departments who document the certification or licensing of health workers and their work history.
The history of technology is the history of the invention of tools and techniques and is one of the categories of world history.
Technology can refer to methods ranging from as simple as stone tools to the complex genetic engineering and information technology that has emerged since the 1980s.
"The term technology comes from the Greek word techne, meaning art and craft, and the word logos, meaning word and speech."
"Since much of technology is applied science, technical history is connected to the history of science."
"Since technology uses resources, technical history is tightly connected to economic history."
"From those resources, technology produces other resources, including technological artifacts used in everyday life."
"Technological change affects, and is affected by, a society's cultural traditions."
"It is a force for economic growth and a means to develop and project economic, political, military power and wealth."
"Morgan's concept of three major stages of social evolution (savagery, barbarism, and civilization) can be divided by technological milestones, such as fire."
"White differentiates between five stages of human development: In the first, people use the energy of their own muscles."
"In the second, they use the energy of domesticated animals."
"In the third, they use the energy of plants (agricultural revolution)."
"In the fourth, they learn to use the energy of natural resources: coal, oil, gas."
"In the fifth, they harness nuclear energy."
"In his own words, ""culture evolves as the amount of energy harnessed per capita per year is increased, or as the efficiency of the instrumental means of putting the energy to work is increased""."
"Nikolai Kardashev extrapolated his theory, creating the Kardashev scale, which categorizes the energy use of advanced civilizations."
Lenski's approach focuses on information.
"The more information and knowledge (especially allowing the shaping of natural environment) a given society has, the more advanced it is."
"He identifies four stages of human development, based on advances in the history of communication."
"In the first stage, information is passed by genes."
"In the second, when humans gain sentience, they can learn and pass information through experience."
"In the third, the humans start using signs and develop logic."
"In the fourth, they can create symbols, develop language and writing."
"Advancements in communications technology translate into advancements in the economic system and political system, distribution of wealth, social inequality and other spheres of social life."
Productivity increases when fewer inputs (classically labor and capital but some measures include energy and materials) are used in the production of a unit of output.
"Another indicator of technological progress is the development of new products and services, which is necessary to offset unemployment that would otherwise result as labor inputs are reduced."
"In developed countries productivity growth has been slowing since the late 1970s; however, productivity growth was higher in some economic sectors, such as manufacturing."
"For example, employment in manufacturing in the United States declined from over 30% in the 1940s to just over 10% 70 years later."
Similar changes occurred in other developed countries.
This stage is referred to as post-industrial.
"In the late 1970s sociologists and anthropologists like Alvin Toffler (author of Future Shock), Daniel Bell and John Naisbitt have approached the theories of post-industrial societies, arguing that the current era of industrial society is coming to an end, and services and information are becoming more important than industry and goods."
"Some extreme visions of the post-industrial society, especially in fiction, are strikingly similar to the visions of near and post-Singularity societies."
"The first major technologies were tied to survival, hunting, and food preparation."
"Stone tools and weapons, fire, and clothing were technological developments of major importance during this period."
"Human ancestors have been using stone and other tools since long before the emergence of Homo sapiens approximately 200,000 years ago."
"This era of stone tool use is called the Paleolithic, or ""Old stone age"", and spans all of human history up to the development of agriculture approximately 12,000 years ago."
"To make a stone tool, a ""core"" of hard stone with specific flaking properties (such as flint) was struck with a hammerstone."
"This flaking produced sharp edges which could be used as tools, primarily in the form of choppers or scrapers."
This early Stone Age is described as the Lower Paleolithic.
"The Middle Paleolithic, approximately 300,000 years ago, saw the introduction of the prepared-core technique, where multiple blades could be rapidly formed from a single core stone."
"The Mesolithic technology included the use of microliths as composite stone tools, along with wood, bone, and antler tools."
"The later Stone Age, during which the rudiments of agricultural technology were developed, is called the Neolithic period."
"During this period, polished stone tools were made from a variety of hard rocks such as flint, jade, jadeite, and greenstone, largely by working exposures as quarries, but later the valuable rocks were pursued by tunneling underground, the first steps in mining technology."
The polished axes were used for forest clearance and the establishment of crop farming and were so effective as to remain in use when bronze and iron appeared.
"Stone Age humans developed ocean-worthy outrigger canoe technology, leading to migration across the Malay archipelago, across the Indian Ocean to Madagascar and also across the Pacific Ocean, which required knowledge of the ocean currents, weather patterns, sailing, and celestial navigation."
"Although Paleolithic cultures left no written records, the shift from nomadic life to settlement and agriculture can be inferred from a range of archaeological evidence."
"Such evidence includes ancient tools, cave paintings, and other prehistoric art, such as the Venus of Willendorf."
"Human remains also provide direct evidence, both through the examination of bones, and the study of mummies."
"Scientists and historians have been able to form significant inferences about the lifestyle and culture of various prehistoric peoples, and especially their technology."
Copper smelting is believed to have originated when the technology of pottery kilns allowed sufficiently high temperatures.
"The concentration of various elements such as arsenic increase with depth in copper ore deposits and smelting of these ores yields arsenical bronze, which can be sufficiently work hardened to be suitable for making tools."
Bronze is an alloy of copper with tin; the latter being found in relatively few deposits globally caused a long time to elapse before true tin bronze became widespread.
"(See: Tin sources and trade in ancient times) Bronze was a major advance over stone as a material for making tools, both because of its mechanical properties like strength and ductility and because it could be cast in molds to make intricately shaped objects."
Bronze significantly advanced shipbuilding technology with better tools and bronze nails.
Bronze nails replaced the old method of attaching boards of the hull with cord woven through drilled holes.
Better ships enabled long-distance trade and the advance of civilization.
This technological trend apparently began in the Fertile Crescent and spread outward over time.
"These developments were not, and still are not, universal."
"The three-age system does not accurately describe the technology history of groups outside of Eurasia, and does not apply at all in the case of some isolated populations, such as the Spinifex People, the Sentinelese, and various Amazonian tribes, which still make use of Stone Age technology, and have not developed agricultural or metal technology."
"Meteoric iron was rare and valuable, but was sometimes used to make tools and other implements, such as fish hooks."
The Iron Age involved the adoption of iron smelting technology.
"It generally replaced bronze and made it possible to produce tools which were stronger, lighter and cheaper to make than bronze equivalents."
"The raw materials to make iron, such as ore and limestone, are far more abundant than copper and especially tin ores."
"Consequently, iron was produced in many areas."
It was not possible to mass manufacture steel or pure iron because of the high temperatures required.
Furnaces could reach melting temperature but the crucibles and molds needed for melting and casting had not been developed.
"Steel could be produced by forging bloomery iron to reduce the carbon content in a somewhat controllable way, but steel produced by this method was not homogeneous."
"In many Eurasian cultures, the Iron Age was the last major step before the development of written language, though again this was not universally the case."
"In Europe, large hill forts were built either as a refuge in time of war or sometimes as permanent settlements."
"In some cases, existing forts from the Bronze Age were expanded and enlarged."
"The pace of land clearance using the more effective iron axes increased, providing more farmland to support the growing population."
The walls of Babylon were so massive they were quoted as a Wonder of the World.
"They developed extensive water systems; canals for transport and irrigation in the alluvial south, and catchment systems stretching for tens of kilometers in the hilly north."
Many records on clay tablets and stone inscriptions have survived.
"These civilizations were early adopters of bronze technologies which they used for tools, weapons and monumental statuary."
By 1200 BC they could cast objects 5 m long in a single piece.
Several of the six classic simple machines were invented in Mesopotamia.
Mesopotamians have been credited with the invention of the wheel.
"The wheel and axle mechanism first appeared with the potter's wheel, invented in Mesopotamia (modern Iraq) during the 5th millennium BC."
This led to the invention of the wheeled vehicle in Mesopotamia during the early 4th millennium BC.
Depictions of wheeled wagons found on clay tablet pictographs at the Eanna district of Uruk are dated between 3700 and 3500 BCE.
"The lever was used in the shadoof water-lifting device, the first crane machine, which appeared in Mesopotamia circa 3000 BC."
"The Assyrian King Sennacherib (704–681 BC) claims to have invented automatic sluices and to have been the first to use water screw pumps, of up to 30 tons weight, which were cast using two-part clay molds rather than by the 'lost wax' process."
They enabled meticulous astronomers to plot the motions of the planets and to predict eclipses.
"The earliest evidence of water wheels and watermills date back to the ancient Near East in the 4th century BC, specifically in the Persian Empire before 350 BCE, in the regions of Mesopotamia (Iraq) and Persia (Iran)."
This pioneering use of water power constituted the first human-devised motive force not to rely on muscle power (besides the sail).
"Historians and archaeologists have found evidence that the pyramids were built using three of what is called the Six Simple Machines, from which all machines are based."
Papyrus is a plant (cyperus papyrus) which grew in plentiful amounts in the Egyptian Delta and throughout the Nile River Valley during ancient times.
The papyrus was harvested by field workers and brought to processing centers where it was cut into thin strips.
"The strips were then laid out side by side perpendicularly then covered in plant resin and the second layer of strips was laid on horizontally, then pressed together until the sheet was dry."
"According to Hossam Elanzeery, they were the first civilization to use timekeeping devices such as sundials, shadow clocks, and obelisks and successfully leveraged their knowledge of astronomy to create a calendar model that society still uses today."
They developed shipbuilding technology that saw them progress from papyrus reed vessels to cedar wood ships while also pioneering the use of rope trusses and stem-mounted rudders.
The Egyptians also used their knowledge of anatomy to lay the foundation for many modern medical techniques and practiced the earliest known version of neuroscience.
"Based on paintings and reliefs found in tombs, as well as archaeological artifacts, scholars like Paul T Nicholson believe that the Ancient Egyptians established systematic farming practices, engaged in cereal processing, brewed beer and baked bread, processed meat, practiced viticulture and created the basis for modern wine production, and created condiments to complement, preserve and mask the flavors of their food."
"Indus Valley construction and architecture, called 'Vaastu Shastra', suggests a thorough understanding of materials engineering, hydrology, and sanitation."
"Major technological contributions from China include early seismological detectors, matches, paper, Helicopter rotor, Raised-relief map, the double-action piston pump, cast iron, water powered blast furnace bellows, the iron plough, the multi-tube seed drill, the wheelbarrow, the parachute, the compass, the rudder, the crossbow, the South Pointing Chariot and gunpowder."
"China also developed deep well drilling, which they used to extract brine for making salt."
"The solid-fuel rocket was invented in China about 1150, nearly 200 years after the invention of gunpowder (which acted as the rocket's fuel)."
"Decades before the West's age of exploration, the Chinese emperors of the Ming Dynasty also sent large fleets on maritime voyages, some reaching Africa."
"The Hellenistic period saw a sharp increase in technological advancement, fostered by a climate of openness to new ideas, the blossoming of a mechanistic philosophy, and the establishment of the Library of Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt and its close association with the adjacent museion."
"In contrast to the typically anonymous inventors of earlier ages, ingenious minds such as Archimedes, Philo of Byzantium, Heron, Ctesibius, and Archytas remain known by name to posterity."
"In time-keeping, the introduction of the inflow clepsydra and its mechanization by the dial and pointer, the application of a feedback system and the escapement mechanism far superseded the earlier outflow clepsydra."
"Innovations in mechanical technology included the newly devised right-angled gear, which would become particularly important to the operation of mechanical devices."
"Hellenistic engineers also devised automata such as suspended ink pots, automatic washstands, and doors, primarily as toys, which however featured new useful mechanisms such as the cam and gimbals."
"The Antikythera mechanism, a kind of analogous computer working with a differential gear, and the astrolabe both show great refinement in astronomical science."
"In other fields, ancient Greek innovations include the catapult and the gastraphetes crossbow in warfare, hollow bronze-casting in metallurgy, the dioptra for surveying, in infrastructure the lighthouse, central heating, a tunnel excavated from both ends by scientific calculations, and the ship trackway."
"In transport, great progress resulted from the invention of the winch and the odometer."
"Further newly created techniques and items were spiral staircases, the chain drive, sliding calipers and showers."
"Roman engineers were the first to build monumental arches, amphitheatres, aqueducts, public baths, true arch bridges, harbours, reservoirs and dams, vaults and domes on a very large scale across their Empire."
"Notable Roman inventions include the book (Codex), glass blowing and concrete."
"Because Rome was located on a volcanic peninsula, with sand which contained suitable crystalline grains, the concrete which the Romans formulated was especially durable."
"Some of their buildings have lasted 2000 years, to the present day."
"In Roman Egypt, the inventor Hero of Alexandria was the first to experiment with a wind-powered mechanical device (see Heron's windwheel) and even created the earliest steam-powered device (the aeolipile), opening up new possibilities in harnessing natural forces."
He also devised a vending machine.
"However, his inventions were primarily toys, rather than practical machines."
An example of this exceptional engineering is the use of pieces weighing upwards of one ton in their stonework placed together so that not even a blade can fit into the cracks.
"Inca villages used irrigation canals and drainage systems, making agriculture very efficient."
"While some claim that the Incas were the first inventors of hydroponics, their agricultural technology was still soil based, if advanced."
"Though the Maya civilization did not incorporate metallurgy or wheel technology in their architectural constructions, they developed complex writing and astronomical systems, and created beautiful sculptural works in stone and flint."
"Like the Inca, the Maya also had command of fairly advanced agricultural and construction technology."
"In Mesoamerica, without draft animals for transport (nor, as a result, wheeled vehicles), the roads were designed for travel on foot, just as in the Inca and Mayan civilizations."
"The Aztec, subsequently to the Maya, inherited many of the technologies and intellectual advancements of their predecessors: the Olmec (see Native American inventions and innovations)."
Most water and wind power was used for milling grain.
"Water power was also used for blowing air in blast furnace, pulping rags for paper making and for felting wool."
"The Domesday Book recorded 5,624 water mills in Great Britain in 1086, being about one per thirty families."
"The science and technology of previous empires in the region, including the Mesopotamian, Egyptian, Persian, Hellenistic and Roman empires, were inherited by the Muslim world, where Arabic replaced Syriac, Persian and Greek as the lingua franca of the region."
Significant advances were made in the region during the Islamic Golden Age (8th-16th centuries).
The Arab Agricultural Revolution occurred during this period.
It was a transformation in agriculture from the 8th to the 13th century in the Islamic region of the Old World.
"The economy established by Arab and other Muslim traders across the Old World enabled the diffusion of many crops and farming techniques throughout the Islamic world, as well as the adaptation of crops and techniques from and to regions outside it."
"Advances were made in animal husbandry, irrigation, and farming, with the help of new technology such as the windmill."
"These changes made agriculture much more productive, supporting population growth, urbanisation, and increased stratification of society."
"Muslim engineers in the Islamic world made wide use of hydropower, along with early uses of tidal power, wind power, fossil fuels such as petroleum, and large factory complexes (tiraz in Arabic)."
"A variety of industrial mills were employed in the Islamic world, including fulling mills, gristmills, hullers, sawmills, ship mills, stamp mills, steel mills, and tide mills."
"By the 11th century, every province throughout the Islamic world had these industrial mills in operation."
"Muslim engineers also employed water turbines and gears in mills and water-raising machines, and pioneered the use of dams as a source of water power, used to provide additional power to watermills and water-raising machines."
"They were used to grind grains and draw up water, and used in the gristmilling and sugarcane industries."
Sugar mills first appeared in the medieval Islamic world.
"They were first driven by watermills, and then windmills from the 9th and 10th centuries in what are today Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran."
"Crops such as almonds and citrus fruit were brought to Europe through Al-Andalus, and sugar cultivation was gradually adopted across Europe."
Arab merchants dominated trade in the Indian Ocean until the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century.
The Muslim world adopted papermaking from China.
The earliest paper mills appeared in Abbasid-era Baghdad during 794–795.
"It was later widely adopted in Europe, where it was adapted into the spinning jenny, a key device during the Industrial Revolution."
"The crankshaft was invented by Al-Jazari in 1206, and is central to modern machinery such as the steam engine, internal combustion engine and automatic controls."
"The first music sequencer, a programmable musical instrument, was an automated flute player invented by the Banu Musa brothers, described in their Book of Ingenious Devices, in the 9th century."
"In 1206, Al-Jazari invented programmable automata/robots."
"He described four automaton musicians, including two drummers operated by a programmable drum machine, where the drummer could be made to play different rhythms and different drum patterns."
He described a method for rotating a spit by means of a jet of steam playing on rotary vanes around the periphery of a wheel.
"Known as a steam jack, a similar device for rotating a spit was also later described by John Wilkins in 1648."
"Genuine medieval contributions include for example mechanical clocks, spectacles and vertical windmills."
Medieval ingenuity was also displayed in the invention of seemingly inconspicuous items like the watermark or the functional button.
"In navigation, the foundation to the subsequent age of exploration was laid by the introduction of pintle-and-gudgeon rudders, lateen sails, the dry compass, the horseshoe and the astrolabe."
"Significant advances were also made in military technology with the development of plate armour, steel crossbows and cannon."
"The Middle Ages are perhaps best known for their architectural heritage: While the invention of the rib vault and pointed arch gave rise to the high rising Gothic style, the ubiquitous medieval fortifications gave the era the almost proverbial title of the 'age of castles'."
"Papermaking, a 2nd-century Chinese technology, was carried to the Middle East when a group of Chinese papermakers were captured in the 8th century."
Papermaking technology was spread to Europe by the Umayyad conquest of Hispania.
A paper mill was established in Sicily in the 12th century.
In Europe the fiber to make pulp for making paper was obtained from linen and cotton rags.
De re metallica was the standard chemistry reference for the next 180 years.
"Among the water powered mechanical devices in use were ore stamping mills, forge hammers, blast bellows, and suction pumps."
"Due to the casting of cannon, the blast furnace came into widespread use in France in the mid 15th century."
Note books of the Renaissance artist-engineers such as Taccola and Leonardo da Vinci give a deep insight into the mechanical technology then known and applied.
"Architects and engineers were inspired by the structures of Ancient Rome, and men like Brunelleschi created the large dome of Florence Cathedral as a result."
He was awarded one of the first patents ever issued in order to protect an ingenious crane he designed to raise the large masonry stones to the top of the structure.
"Military technology developed rapidly with the widespread use of the cross-bow and ever more powerful artillery, as the city-states of Italy were usually in conflict with one another."
Powerful families like the Medici were strong patrons of the arts and sciences.
Renaissance science spawned the Scientific Revolution; science and technology began a cycle of mutual advancement.
"Pioneers like Vasco da Gama, Cabral, Magellan and Christopher Columbus explored the world in search of new trade routes for their goods and contacts with Africa, India and China to shorten the journey compared with traditional routes overland."
They produced new maps and charts which enabled following mariners to explore further with greater confidence.
"Navigation was generally difficult, however, owing to the problem of longitude and the absence of accurate chronometers."
"European powers rediscovered the idea of the civil code, lost since the time of the Ancient Greeks."
Some mines used as many as 500 horses.
Horse-powered pumps were replaced by the Savery steam pump (1698) and the Newcomen steam engine (1712).
"The British Industrial Revolution is characterized by developments in the areas of textile machinery, mining, metallurgy and transport the steam engine and the invention of machine tools."
"Before invention of machinery to spin yarn and weave cloth, spinning was done using the spinning wheel and weaving was done on a hand-and-foot-operated loom."
It took from three to five spinners to supply one weaver.
"The invention of the flying shuttle in 1733 doubled the output of a weaver, creating a shortage of spinners."
The spinning frame for wool was invented in 1738.
"The spinning jenny, invented in 1764, was a machine that used multiple spinning wheels; however, it produced low quality thread."
"The water frame patented by Richard Arkwright in 1767, produced a better quality thread than the spinning jenny."
"The spinning mule, patented in 1779 by Samuel Crompton, produced a high quality thread."
The power loom was invented by Edmund Cartwright in 1787.
"In the mid 1750s the steam engine was applied to the water power-constrained iron, copper and lead industries for powering blast bellows."
"These industries were located near the mines, some of which were using steam engines for mine pumping."
"Steam engines were too powerful for leather bellows, so cast iron blowing cylinders were developed in 1768."
"Steam powered blast furnaces achieved higher temperatures, allowing the use of more lime in iron blast furnace feed."
"With a sufficient lime ratio, sulfur from coal or coke fuel reacts with the slag so that the sulfur does not contaminate the iron."
Coal and coke were cheaper and more abundant fuel.
"As a result, iron production rose significantly during the last decades of the 18th century."
"Coal converted to coke fueled higher temperature blast furnaces and produced cast iron in much larger amounts than before, allowing the creation of a  range of structures such as The Iron Bridge."
"Cheap coal meant that industry was no longer constrained by water resources driving the mills, although it continued as a valuable source of power."
"The steam engine helped drain the mines, so more coal reserves could be accessed, and the output of coal increased."
"The development of the high-pressure steam engine made locomotives possible, and a transport revolution followed."
"The steam engine which had existed since the early 18th century, was practically applied to both steamboat and railway transportation."
"The Liverpool and Manchester Railway, the first purpose built railway line, opened in 1830, the Rocket locomotive of Robert Stephenson being one of its first working locomotives used."
Manufacture of ships' pulley blocks by all-metal machines at the Portsmouth Block Mills in 1803 instigated the age of sustained mass production.
"Machine tools used by engineers to manufacture parts began in the first decade of the century, notably by Richard Roberts and Joseph Whitworth."
"After a recession at the end of the 1830s and a general slowdown in major inventions, the Second Industrial Revolution was a period of rapid innovation and industrialization that began in the 1860s or around 1870 and lasted until World War I."
"It included rapid development of chemical, electrical, petroleum, and steel technologies connected with highly structured technology research."
Telegraphy developed into a practical technology in the 19th century to help run the railways safely.
Along with the development of telegraphy was the patenting of the first telephone.
"March 1876 marks the date that Alexander Graham Bell officially patented his version of an ""electric telegraph""."
Mass production of sewing machines and agricultural machinery such as reapers occurred in the mid to late 19th century.
Military research and development sped advances including electronic computing and jet engines.
"Radio and telephony greatly improved and spread to larger populations of users, though near-universal access would not be possible until mobile phones became affordable to developing world residents in the late 2000s and early 2010s."
"Energy and engine technology improvements included nuclear power, developed after the Manhattan project which heralded the new Atomic Age."
Rocket development led to long range missiles and the first space age that lasted from the 1950s with the launch of Sputnik to the mid-1980s.
Electrification spread rapidly in the 20th century.
"At the beginning of the century electric power was for the most part only available to wealthy people in a few major cities such as New York, London, Paris, and Newcastle upon Tyne, but by the time the World Wide Web was invented in 1990 an estimated 62 percent of homes worldwide had electric power, including about a third of households in the rural developing world."
Birth control also became widespread during the 20th century.
"Electron microscopes were very powerful by the late 1970s and genetic theory and knowledge were expanding, leading to developments in genetic engineering."
"The first ""test tube baby"" Louise Brown was born in 1978, which led to the first successful gestational surrogacy pregnancy in 1985 and the first pregnancy by ICSI in 1991, which is the implanting of a single sperm into an egg."
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis was first performed in late 1989 and led to successful births in July 1990.
These procedures have become relatively common.
"The massive data analysis resources necessary for running transatlantic research programs such as the Human Genome Project and the Large Electron–Positron Collider led to a necessity for distributed communications, causing Internet protocols to be more widely adopted by researchers and also creating a justification for Tim Berners-Lee to create the World Wide Web."
"Vaccination spread rapidly to the developing world from the 1980s onward due to many successful humanitarian initiatives, greatly reducing childhood mortality in many poor countries with limited medical resources."
"Perhaps the greatest research tool built in the 21st century is the Large Hadron Collider, the largest single machine ever built."
The understanding of particle physics is expected to expand with better instruments including larger particle accelerators such as the LHC and better neutrino detectors.
Dark matter is sought via underground detectors and observatories like LIGO have started to detect gravitational waves.
"New, more capable space telescopes, such as the James Webb Telescope, to be launched to orbit in late 2021, and the Colossus Telescope are being designed."
"The International Space Station was completed in the 2000s, and NASA and ESA plan a human mission to Mars in the 2030s."
The Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rocket (VASIMR) is an electro-magnetic thruster for spacecraft propulsion and is expected to be tested in 2015.
"From MIT OpenCourseWare, course materials (graduate level) for a course on the history of technology through a Thomas Kuhn-ian lens."
Events occurring before the invention of writing systems are considered prehistory.
"""History"" is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events."
Historians seek to understand and represent the past through narratives.
"They often debate which narrative best explains an event, as well as the significance of different causes and effects."
History differs from myth in that it is supported by evidence.
"However, ancient influences have helped spawn variant interpretations of the nature of history which have evolved over the centuries and continue to change today."
"The modern study of history is wide-ranging, and includes the study of specific regions and the study of certain topical or thematic elements of historical investigation."
"History is often taught as part of primary and secondary education, and the academic study of history is a major discipline in university studies."
"Herodotus, a 5th-century BC Greek historian is often considered (within the Western tradition) to be the ""father of history"", or, the ""father of lies""."
"Along with his contemporary Thucydides, he helped form the foundations for the modern study of human history."
"Their works continue to be read today, and the gap between the culture-focused Herodotus and the military-focused Thucydides remains a point of contention or approach in modern historical writing."
"In East Asia, a state chronicle, the Spring and Autumn Annals, was known to be compiled from as early as 722 BC although only 2nd-century BC texts have survived."
It was in that sense that Aristotle used the word in his History of Animals.
"The ancestor word ἵστωρ is attested early on in Homeric Hymns, Heraclitus, the Athenian ephebes' oath, and in Boiotic inscriptions (in a legal sense, either ""judge"" or ""witness"", or similar)."
"The Greek word was borrowed into Classical Latin as historia, meaning ""investigation, inquiry, research, account, description, written account of past events, writing of history, historical narrative, recorded knowledge of past events, story, narrative""."
"History was borrowed from Latin (possibly via Old Irish or Old Welsh) into Old English as stær (""history, narrative, story""), but this word fell out of use in the late Old English period."
"In Middle English, the meaning of history was ""story"" in general."
"With the Renaissance, older senses of the word were revived, and it was in the Greek sense that Francis Bacon used the term in the late 16th century, when he wrote about natural history."
"In modern German, French, and most Germanic and Romance languages, which are solidly synthetic and highly inflected, the same word is still used to mean both ""history"" and ""story""."
"Historian in the sense of a ""researcher of history"" is attested from 1531."
"In all European languages, the substantive history is still used to mean both ""what happened with men"", and ""the scholarly study of the happened"", the latter sense sometimes distinguished with a capital letter, or the word historiography."
"The adjective historical is attested from 1661, and historic from 1669."
"In the words of Benedetto Croce, ""All history is contemporary history""."
"History is facilitated by the formation of a ""true discourse of past"" through the production of narrative and analysis of past events relating to the human race."
The modern discipline of history is dedicated to the institutional production of this discourse.
All events that are remembered and preserved in some authentic form constitute the historical record.
The task of historical discourse is to identify the sources which can most usefully contribute to the production of accurate accounts of past.
"Therefore, the constitution of the historian's archive is a result of circumscribing a more general archive by invalidating the usage of certain texts and documents (by falsifying their claims to represent the ""true past"")."
"Part of the historian's role is to skillfully and objectively utilize the vast amount of sources from the past, most often found in the archives."
"It can also be seen as a bridge between those two broad areas, incorporating methodologies from both."
Some individual historians strongly support one or the other classification.
"In the 20th century, French historian Fernand Braudel revolutionized the study of history, by using such outside disciplines as economics, anthropology, and geography in the study of global history."
"Traditionally, historians have recorded events of the past, either in writing or by passing on an oral tradition, and have attempted to answer historical questions through the study of written documents and oral accounts."
"From the beginning, historians have also used such sources as monuments, inscriptions, and pictures."
"In general, the sources of historical knowledge can be separated into three categories: what is written, what is said, and what is physically preserved, and historians often consult all three."
But writing is the marker that separates history from what comes before.
"Archaeology is especially helpful in unearthing buried sites and objects, which contribute to the study of history."
"Archaeological finds rarely stand alone, with narrative sources complementing its discoveries."
Archaeology's methodologies and approaches are independent from the field of history.
"""Historical archaeology"" is a specific branch of archaeology which often contrasts its conclusions against those of contemporary textual sources."
"For example, Mark Leone, the excavator and interpreter of historical Annapolis, Maryland, USA, has sought to understand the contradiction between textual documents idealizing ""liberty"" and the material record, demonstrating the possession of slaves and the inequalities of wealth made apparent by the study of the total historical environment."
"There are varieties of ways in which history can be organized, including chronologically, culturally, territorially, and thematically."
"These divisions are not mutually exclusive, and significant intersections are often present."
"It is possible for historians to concern themselves with both the very specific and the very general, although the modern trend has been toward specialization."
"The area called Big History resists this specialization, and searches for universal patterns or trends."
"History has often been studied with some practical or theoretical aim, but also may be studied out of simple intellectual curiosity."
"By ""prehistory"", historians mean the recovery of knowledge of the past in an area where no written records exist, or where the writing of a culture is not understood."
"By studying painting, drawings, carvings, and other artifacts, some information can be recovered even in the absence of a written record."
"Since the 20th century, the study of prehistory is considered essential to avoid history's implicit exclusion of certain civilizations, such as those of Sub-Saharan Africa and pre-Columbian America."
Historians in the West have been criticized for focusing disproportionately on the Western world.
History begins with the handing down of tradition; and tradition means the carrying of the habits and lessons of the past into the future.
Records of the past begin to be kept for the benefit of future generations.
"This definition includes within the scope of history the strong interests of peoples, such as Indigenous Australians and New Zealand Māori in the past, and the oral records maintained and transmitted to succeeding generations, even before their contact with European civilization."
"Firstly, it can refer to how history has been produced: the story of the development of methodology and practices (for example, the move from short-term biographical narrative towards long-term thematic analysis)."
"Secondly, it can refer to what has been produced: a specific body of historical writing (for example, ""medieval historiography during the 1960s"" means ""Works of medieval history written during the 1960s"")."
"Thirdly, it may refer to why history is produced: the philosophy of history."
"As a meta-level analysis of descriptions of the past, this third conception can relate to the first two in that the analysis usually focuses on the narratives, interpretations, world view, use of evidence, or method of presentation of other historians."
Professional historians also debate the question of whether history can be taught as a single coherent narrative or a series of competing narratives.
"Thucydides, unlike Herodotus, regarded history as being the product of the choices and actions of human beings, and looked at cause and effect, rather than as the result of divine intervention (though Herodotus was not wholly committed to this idea himself)."
"In his historical method, Thucydides emphasized chronology, a nominally neutral point of view, and that the human world was the result of the actions of human beings."
"The groundwork for professional historiography in East Asia was established by the Han dynasty court historian known as Sima Qian (145–90 BC), author of the Records of the Grand Historian (Shiji)."
"For the quality of his written work, Sima Qian is posthumously known as the Father of Chinese historiography."
"Through the Medieval and Renaissance periods, history was often studied through a sacred or religious perspective."
"In this criticism, he approached the past as strange and in need of interpretation."
"The originality of Ibn Khaldun was to claim that the cultural difference of another age must govern the evaluation of relevant historical material, to distinguish the principles according to which it might be possible to attempt the evaluation, and lastly, to feel the need for experience, in addition to rational principles, in order to assess a culture of the past."
"Ibn Khaldun often criticized ""idle superstition and uncritical acceptance of historical data."""
"As a result, he introduced a scientific method to the study of history, and he often referred to it as his ""new science""."
He limited history to “what really happened” and by this directed the field further away from science.
"For Ranke, historical data should be collected carefully, examined objectively and put together with critical rigor."
But these procedures “are merely the prerequisites and preliminaries of science.
"Thus if Historians tell us that, given the manner in which he practices his craft, it cannot be considered a science, we must take him at his word."
"If he is not doing science, then, whatever else he is doing, he is not doing science."
"The traditional Historian is thus no scientist and history, as conventionally practiced, is not a science."
"In the 20th century, academic historians focused less on epic nationalistic narratives, which often tended to glorify the nation or great men, to more objective and complex analyses of social and intellectual forces."
"A major trend of historical methodology in the 20th century was a tendency to treat history more as a social science rather than as an art, which traditionally had been the case."
Many of the advocates of history as a social science were or are noted for their multi-disciplinary approach.
"Braudel combined history with geography, Bracher history with political science, Fogel history with economics, Gay history with psychology, Trigger history with archaeology while Wehler, Bloch, Fischer, Stone, Febvre and Le Roy Ladurie have in varying and differing ways amalgamated history with sociology, geography, anthropology, and economics."
"Nevertheless, these multidisciplinary approaches failed to produce a theory of history."
So far only one theory of history came from the pen of a professional Historian.
"Whatever other theories of history we have, they were written by experts from other fields (for example, Marxian theory of history)."
"More recently, the field of digital history has begun to address ways of using computer technology to pose new questions to historical data and generate digital scholarship."
"In sincere opposition to the claims of history as a social science, historians such as Hugh Trevor-Roper, John Lukacs, Donald Creighton, Gertrude Himmelfarb and Gerhard Ritter argued that the key to the historians' work was the power of the imagination, and hence contended that history should be understood as an art."
"Intellectual historians such as Herbert Butterfield, Ernst Nolte and George Mosse have argued for the significance of ideas in history."
"American historians, motivated by the civil rights era, focused on formerly overlooked ethnic, racial, and socio-economic groups."
Another genre of social history to emerge in the post-WWII era was Alltagsgeschichte (History of Everyday Life).
"Scholars such as Martin Broszat, Ian Kershaw and Detlev Peukert sought to examine what everyday life was like for ordinary people in 20th-century Germany, especially in the Nazi period."
"Feminist historians such as Joan Wallach Scott, Claudia Koonz, Natalie Zemon Davis, Sheila Rowbotham, Gisela Bock, Gerda Lerner, Elizabeth Fox-Genovese, and Lynn Hunt have argued for the importance of studying the experience of women in the past."
"In recent years, postmodernists have challenged the validity and need for the study of history on the basis that all history is based on the personal interpretation of sources."
"Another defence of history from post-modernist criticism was the Australian historian Keith Windschuttle's 1994 book, The Killing of History."
"Today, most historians begin their research process in the archives, on either a physical or digital platform."
They often propose an argument and use their research to support it.
"Digital information companies, such as Google, have sparked controversy over the role of internet censorship in information access."
"Overall, Marx and Engels claimed to have identified five successive stages of the development of these material conditions in Western Europe."
"Marxist historiography was once orthodoxy in the Soviet Union, but since the collapse of communism there in 1991, Mikhail Krom says it has been reduced to the margins of scholarship."
Constantin Fasolt suggested that history is linked to politics by the practice of silence itself.
Historical omissions can occur in many ways and can have a profound effect on historical records.
Information can also purposely be excluded or left out accidentally.
"Historians have coined multiple terms that describe the act of omitting historical information, including: “silencing,” “selective memory,” and erasures."
"Historians give these periods of time names in order to allow ""organising ideas and classificatory generalisations"" to be used by historians."
"The names given to a period can vary with geographical location, as can the dates of the beginning and end of a particular period."
Centuries and decades are commonly used periods and the time they represent depends on the dating system used.
Most periods are constructed retrospectively and so reflect value judgments made about the past.
The way periods are constructed and the names given to them can affect the way they are viewed and studied.
"The usual method for periodisation of the distant prehistoric past, in archaeology is to rely on changes in material culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age and their sub-divisions also based on different styles of material remains."
"Here prehistory is divided into a series of ""chapters"" so that periods in history could unfold not only in a relative chronology but also narrative chronology."
This narrative content could be in the form of functional-economic interpretation.
"There are periodisation, however, that do not have this narrative aspect, relying largely on relative chronology and, thus, devoid of any specific meaning."
"Despite the development over recent decades of the ability through radiocarbon dating and other scientific methods to give actual dates for many sites or artefacts, these long-established schemes seem likely to remain in use."
"In many cases neighbouring cultures with writing have left some history of cultures without it, which may be used."
"Periodisation, however, is not viewed as a perfect framework with one account explaining that ""cultural changes do not conveniently start and stop (combinedly) at periodisation boundaries"" and that different trajectories of change are also needed to be studied in their own right before they get intertwined with cultural phenomena."
Understanding why historic events took place is important.
"To do this, historians often turn to geography."
"According to Jules Michelet in his book Histoire de France (1833), ""without geographical basis, the people, the makers of history, seem to be walking on air."""
"Weather patterns, the water supply, and the landscape of a place all affect the lives of the people who live there."
"For example, to explain why the ancient Egyptians developed a successful civilization, studying the geography of Egypt is essential."
"Egyptian civilization was built on the banks of the Nile River, which flooded each year, depositing soil on its banks."
The rich soil could help farmers grow enough crops to feed the people in the cities.
"That meant everyone did not have to farm, so some people could perform other jobs that helped develop the civilization."
"There is also the case of climate, which historians like Ellsworth Huntington and Allen Semple, cited as a crucial influence on the course of history and racial temperament."
"The ""new military history"" since the 1970s has been concerned with soldiers more than generals, with psychology more than tactics, and with the broader impact of warfare on society and culture."
"Leading journals include Church History, The Catholic Historical Review, and History of Religions."
"Topics range widely from political and cultural and artistic dimensions, to theology and liturgy."
This subject studies religions from all regions and areas of the world where humans have lived.
"In its ""golden age"" it was a major growth field in the 1960s and 1970s among scholars, and still is well represented in history departments."
"In two decades from 1975 to 1995, the proportion of professors of history in American universities identifying with social history rose from 31% to 41%, while the proportion of political historians fell from 40% to 30%."
"In the history departments of British universities in 2007, of the 5723 faculty members, 1644 (29%)  identified themselves with social history while political history came next with 1425 (25%)."
"The ""old"" social history before the 1960s was a hodgepodge of topics without a central theme, and it often included political movements, like Populism, that were ""social"" in the sense of being outside the elite system."
"Social history was contrasted with political history, intellectual history and the history of great men."
"While the field has often been viewed negatively as history with the politics left out, it has also been defended as ""history with the people put back in."""
"It typically combines the approaches of anthropology and history to look at language, popular cultural traditions and cultural interpretations of historical experience."
"It examines the records and narrative descriptions of past knowledge, customs, and arts of a group of people."
How peoples constructed their memory of the past is a major topic.
Cultural history includes the study of art in society as well is the study of images and human visual production (iconography).
More recently it looks at the causes of peace and human rights.
"It typically presents the viewpoints of the foreign office, and long-term strategic values, as the driving force of continuity and change in history."
This type of political history is the study of the conduct of international relations between states or across state boundaries over time.
"Historian Muriel Chamberlain notes that after the First World War, ""diplomatic history replaced constitutional history as the flagship of historical investigation, at once the most important, most exact and most sophisticated of historical studies."""
"She adds that after 1945, the trend reversed, allowing social history to replace it."
"Business history  deals with the history of individual business organizations, business methods, government regulation, labour relations, and impact on society."
"It also includes biographies of individual companies, executives, and entrepreneurs."
It is related to economic history; Business history is most often taught in business schools.
"It is an offshoot of the environmental movement, which was kickstarted by Rachel Carson's Silent Spring in the 1960s."
"World history is primarily a teaching field, rather than a research field."
"It gained popularity in the United States, Japan and other countries after the 1980s with the realization that students need a broader exposure to the world as globalization proceeds."
The World History Association publishes the Journal of World History every quarter since 1990.
"The H-World discussion list serves as a network of communication among practitioners of world history, with discussions among scholars, announcements, syllabi, bibliographies and book reviews."
A people's history is the history of the world that is the story of mass movements and of the outsiders.
"Individuals or groups not included in the past in other type of writing about history are the primary focus, which includes the disenfranchised, the oppressed, the poor, the nonconformists, and the otherwise forgotten people."
"The authors are typically on the left and have a socialist model in mind, as in the approach of the History Workshop movement in Britain in the 1960s."
The outgrowth of gender history from women's history stemmed from many non-feminist historians dismissing the importance of women in history.
"Despite being a relatively new field, gender history has had a significant effect on the general study of history."
"Gender history traditionally differs from women's history in its inclusion of all aspects of gender such as masculinity and femininity, and today's gender history extends to include people who identify outside of that binary."
"Public history practice has quite deep roots in the areas of historic preservation, archival science, oral history, museum curatorship, and other related fields."
"Some of the most common settings for public history are museums, historic homes and historic sites, parks, battlefields, archives, film and television companies, and all levels of government."
"A common feature of LGBTQ+ history is the focus on oral history and individual perspectives, in addition to traditional documents within the archives."
"They discover this information through archaeological evidence, written primary sources, verbal stories or oral histories, and other archival material."
"In lists of historians, historians can be grouped by order of the historical period in which they were writing, which is not necessarily the same as the period in which they specialized."
"Chroniclers and annalists, though they are not historians in the true sense, are also frequently included."
"The goals of historical judgements or interpretations are separate to those of legal judgements, that need to be formulated quickly after the events and be final."
A related issue to that of the judgement of history is that of collective memory.
It is closely related to deceptive historical revisionism.
"Works which draw controversial conclusions from new, speculative, or disputed historical evidence, particularly in the fields of national, political, military, and religious affairs, are often rejected as pseudohistory."
"At Oxford and Cambridge, scholarship was downplayed."
"Professor Charles Harding Firth, Oxford's Regius Professor of history in 1904 ridiculed the system as best suited to produce superficial journalists."
"The Oxford tutors, who had more votes than the professors, fought back in defence of their system saying that it successfully produced Britain's outstanding statesmen, administrators, prelates, and diplomats, and that mission was as valuable as training scholars."
The tutors dominated the debate until after the Second World War.
A tendency in the 21st century was for the latter schools to increasingly demand scholarly productivity of their younger tenure-track faculty.
"Furthermore, universities have increasingly relied on inexpensive part-time adjuncts to do most of the classroom teaching."
"In the United States after World War I, a strong movement emerged at the university level to teach courses in Western Civilization, so as to give students a common heritage with Europe."
Many view the field from both perspectives.
The teaching of history in French schools was influenced by the Nouvelle histoire as disseminated after the 1960s by Cahiers pédagogiques and Enseignement and other journals for teachers.
"Also influential was the Institut national de recherche et de documentation pédagogique, (INRDP)."
"Joseph Leif, the Inspector-general of teacher training, said pupils children should learn about historians' approaches as well as facts and dates."
"Louis François, Dean of the History/Geography group in the Inspectorate of National Education advised that teachers should provide historic documents and promote ""active methods"" which would give pupils ""the immense happiness of discovery."""
Proponents said it was a reaction against the memorization of names and dates that characterized teaching and left the students bored.
Traditionalists protested loudly it was a postmodern innovation that threatened to leave the youth ignorant of French patriotism and national identity.
"For example, in Japan, mention of the Nanking Massacre has been removed from textbooks and the entire Second World War is given cursory treatment."
Other countries have complained.
"An example of content that is represented different in different regions of the country is the history of the Southern states, where slavery and the American Civil War are treated as controversial topics."
"The result is that ""German textbooks usually downplay national pride and ambitions and aim to develop an understanding of citizenship centered on democracy, progress, human rights, peace, tolerance and Europeanness."""
Human rights are moral principles or norms that describe certain standards of human behaviour and are regularly protected in municipal and international law.
"They are commonly understood as inalienable, fundamental rights ""to which a person is inherently entitled simply because she or he is a human being"" and which are ""inherent in all human beings"", regardless of their age, ethnic origin, location, language, religion, ethnicity, or any other status."
"They are applicable everywhere and at every time in the sense of being universal, and they are egalitarian in the sense of being the same for everyone."
Actions by states and non-governmental organisations form a basis of public policy worldwide.
"The idea of human rights suggests that ""if the public discourse of peacetime global society can be said to have a common moral language, it is that of human rights""."
"The strong claims made by the doctrine of human rights continue to provoke considerable scepticism and debates about the content, nature and justifications of human rights to this day."
Ancient peoples did not have the same modern-day conception of universal human rights.
"The true forerunner of human rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment with such philosophers as John Locke, Francis Hutcheson and Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui and which featured prominently in the political discourse of the American Revolution and the French Revolution."
"From this foundation, the modern human rights arguments emerged over the latter half of the 20th century, possibly as a reaction to slavery, torture, genocide and war crimes, as a realisation of inherent human vulnerability and as being a precondition for the possibility of a just society."
The true forerunner of human-rights discourse was the concept of natural rights which appeared as part of the medieval natural law tradition that became prominent during the European Enlightenment.
"In Britain in 1689, the English Bill of Rights and the Scottish Claim of Right each made illegal a range of oppressive governmental actions."
"Two major revolutions occurred during the 18th century, in the United States (1776) and in France (1789), leading to the United States Declaration of Independence and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen respectively, both of which articulated certain human rights."
"Additionally, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776 encoded into law a number of fundamental civil rights and civil freedoms."
"We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
"In 1831 William Lloyd Garrison wrote in a newspaper called The Liberator that he was trying to enlist his readers in ""the great cause of human rights"" so the term human rights probably came into use sometime between Paine's The Rights of Man and Garrison's publication."
"In 1849 a contemporary, Henry David Thoreau, wrote about human rights in his treatise On the Duty of Civil Disobedience [1] which was later influential on human rights and civil rights thinkers."
"United States Supreme Court Justice David Davis, in his 1867 opinion for Ex Parte Milligan, wrote ""By the protection of the law, human rights are secured; withdraw that protection and they are at the mercy of wicked rulers or the clamor of an excited people."
"""Many groups and movements have managed to achieve profound social changes over the course of the 20th century in the name of human rights."
"In Western Europe and North America, labour unions brought about laws granting workers the right to strike, establishing minimum work conditions and forbidding or regulating child labour."
The women's rights movement succeeded in gaining for many women the right to vote.
National liberation movements in many countries succeeded in driving out colonial powers.
One of the most influential was Mahatma Gandhi's movement to free his native India from British rule.
"Movements by long-oppressed racial and religious minorities succeeded in many parts of the world, among them the civil rights movement, and more recent diverse identity politics movements, on behalf of women and minorities in the United States."
"The foundation of the International Committee of the Red Cross, the 1864 Lieber Code and the first of the Geneva Conventions in 1864 laid the foundations of International humanitarian law, to be further developed following the two World Wars."
"The League's goals included disarmament, preventing war through collective security, settling disputes between countries through negotiation, diplomacy and improving global welfare."
Enshrined in its Charter was a mandate to promote many of the rights which were later included in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
The League of Nations had mandates to support many of the former colonies of the Western European colonial powers during their transition from colony to independent state.
All tacitly realized that for their own discriminated-against minorities to acquire leverage on the basis of legally being able to claim enforcement of these wide-reaching rights would create pressures that would be political dynamite.
"The UDHR urges member states to promote a number of human, civil, economic and social rights, asserting these rights are part of the ""foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world""."
The declaration was the first international legal effort to limit the behavior of states and press upon them duties to their citizens following the model of the rights-duty duality.
"The members of the Commission did not immediately agree on the form of such a bill of rights, and whether, or how, it should be enforced."
"The Commission proceeded to frame the UDHR and accompanying treaties, but the UDHR quickly became the priority."
"Canadian law professor John Humprey and French lawyer Rene Cassin were responsible for much of the cross-national research and the structure of the document respectively, where the articles of the declaration were interpretative of the general principle of the preamble."
"The document was structured by Cassin to include the basic principles of dignity, liberty, equality and brotherhood in the first two articles, followed successively by rights pertaining to individuals; rights of individuals in relation to each other and to groups; spiritual, public and political rights; and economic, social and cultural rights."
"The final three articles place, according to Cassin, rights in the context of limits, duties and the social and political order in which they are to be realized."
"Some of the UDHR was researched and written by a committee of international experts on human rights, including representatives from all continents and all major religions, and drawing on consultation with leaders such as Mahatma Gandhi."
"The inclusion of both civil and political rights and economic, social and cultural rights was predicated on the assumption that basic human rights are indivisible and that the different types of rights listed are inextricably linked."
"Capitalist states tended to place strong emphasis on civil and political rights (such as freedom of association and expression), and were reluctant to include economic and social rights (such as the right to work and the right to join a union)."
"However, they came into force only in 1976, when they were ratified by a sufficient number of countries (despite achieving the ICCPR, a covenant including no economic or social rights, the US only ratified the ICCPR in 1992)."
"The ICESCR commits 155 state parties to work toward the granting of economic, social, and cultural rights (ESCR) to individuals."
Since then numerous other treaties (pieces of legislation) have been offered at the international level.
They are generally known as human rights instruments.
"All UN organs have advisory roles to the United Nations Security Council and the United Nations Human Rights Council, and there are numerous committees within the UN with responsibilities for safeguarding different human rights treaties."
The most senior body of the UN with regard to human rights is the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.
"47 of the 193 UN member states sit on the Council, elected by simple majority in a secret ballot of the United Nations General Assembly."
Members serve a maximum of six years and may have their membership suspended for gross human rights abuses.
The Human Rights Council may request that the Security Council refer cases to the International Criminal Court (ICC) even if the issue being referred is outside the normal jurisdiction of the ICC.
"They are supported by and are created by the treaty that they monitor, With the exception of the CESCR, which was established under a resolution of the Economic and Social Council to carry out the monitoring functions originally assigned to that body under the Covenant, they are technically autonomous bodies, established by the treaties that they monitor and accountable to the state parties of those treaties – rather than subsidiary to the United Nations, though in practice they are closely intertwined with the United Nations system and are supported by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR) and the UN Centre for Human Rights."
The Human Rights Committee promotes participation with the standards of the ICCPR.
The members of the committee express opinions on member countries and make judgments on individual complaints against countries which have ratified an Optional Protocol to the treaty.
"The judgments, termed ""views"", are not legally binding."
It will have the power to receive complaints against the countries that opted into the Optional Protocol once it has come into force.
"It is important to note that unlike the other treaty bodies, the economic committee is not an autonomous body responsible to the treaty parties, but directly responsible to the Economic and Social Council and ultimately to the General Assembly."
"This means that the Economic Committee faces particular difficulties at its disposal only relatively ""weak"" means of implementation in comparison to other treaty bodies."
"Particular difficulties noted by commentators include: perceived vagueness of the principles of the treaty, relative lack of legal texts and decisions, ambivalence of many states in addressing economic, social and cultural rights, comparatively few non-governmental organisations focused on the area and problems with obtaining relevant and precise information."
The Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination monitors the CERD and conducts regular reviews of countries' performance.
"It can make judgments on complaints against member states allowing it, but these are not legally binding."
It issues warnings to attempt to prevent serious contraventions of the convention.
The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women monitors the CEDAW.
"It receives states' reports on their performance and comments on them, and can make judgments on complaints against countries which have opted into the 1999 Optional Protocol."
The Committee Against Torture monitors the CAT and receives states' reports on their performance every four years and comments on them.
Its subcommittee may visit and inspect countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol.
The Committee on the Rights of the Child monitors the CRC and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years.
It does not have the power to receive complaints.
The Committee on Migrant Workers was established in 2004 and monitors the ICRMW and makes comments on reports submitted by states every five years.
It will have the power to receive complaints of specific violations only once ten member states allow it.
The Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was established in 2008 to monitor the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
It has the power to receive complaints against the countries which have opted into the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The Committee on Enforced Disappearances monitors the ICPPED.
All States parties are obliged to submit reports to the Committee on how the rights are being implemented.
CEDAW formerly held all its sessions at United Nations headquarters in New York but now frequently meets at the United Nations Office in Geneva; the other treaty bodies meet in Geneva.
The Human Rights Committee usually holds its March session in New York City.
"In a July 2004 decision, the AU Assembly resolved that the future Court on Human and Peoples' Rights would be integrated with the African Court of Justice."
"Although it has not yet been established, it is intended to take over the duties of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights, as well as act as the supreme court of the African Union, interpreting all necessary laws and treaties."
The Protocol establishing the African Court on Human and Peoples' Rights entered into force in January 2004 but its merging with the Court of Justice has delayed its establishment.
Its members are the thirty-five independent states of the Americas.
"Over the course of the 1990s, with the end of the Cold War, the return to democracy in Latin America, and the thrust toward globalization, the OAS made major efforts to reinvent itself to fit the new context."
"Along with the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, based in San José, Costa Rica, it is one of the bodies that comprise the inter-American system for the promotion and protection of human rights."
The IACHR is a permanent body which meets in regular and special sessions several times a year to examine allegations of human rights violations in the hemisphere.
Its two main functions are thus adjudicatory and advisory.
"Under the former, it hears and rules on the specific cases of human rights violations referred to it."
"Under the latter, it issues opinions on matters of legal interpretation brought to its attention by other OAS bodies or member states."
"The organisation now also includes Brunei Darussalam, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia."
It is an international organisation with legal personality recognised under public international law and has observer status with the United Nations.
The seat of the Council of Europe is in Strasbourg in France.
The Council of Europe is responsible for both the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights.
"These institutions bind the Council's members to a code of human rights which, though strict, are more lenient than those of the United Nations charter on human rights."
The Council also promotes the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages and the European Social Charter.
All 47 member states of the Council of Europe have signed this Convention and are therefore under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
"In order to prevent torture and inhuman or degrading treatment (Article 3 of the Convention), the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture was established."
"One of the oldest Western philosophies on human rights is that they are a product of a natural law, stemming from different philosophical or religious grounds."
Other theories hold that human rights codify moral behavior which is a human social product developed by a process of biological and social evolution (associated with Hume).
Human rights are also described as a sociological pattern of rule setting (as in the sociological theory of law and the work of Weber).
These approaches include the notion that individuals in a society accept rules from legitimate authority in exchange for security and economic advantage (as in Rawls) – a social contract.
"Socrates and his philosophic heirs, Plato and Aristotle, posited the existence of natural justice or natural right (dikaion physikon, δικαιον φυσικον, Latin ius naturale)."
"Natural law theories have featured greatly in the philosophies of Thomas Aquinas, Francisco Suárez, Richard Hooker, Thomas Hobbes, Hugo Grotius, Samuel von Pufendorf, and John Locke."
"In the Seventeenth Century Thomas Hobbes founded a contractualist theory of legal positivism on what all men could agree upon: what they sought (happiness) was subject to contention, but a broad consensus could form around what they feared (violent death at the hands of another)."
"The natural law was how a rational human being, seeking to survive and prosper, would act."
"It was discovered by considering humankind's natural rights, whereas previously it could be said that natural rights were discovered by considering the natural law."
"In Hobbes' opinion, the only way natural law could prevail was for men to submit to the commands of the sovereign."
In this lay the foundations of the theory of a social contract between the governed and the governor.
Hugo Grotius based his philosophy of international law on natural law.
"He wrote that ""even the will of an omnipotent being cannot change or abrogate"" natural law, which ""would maintain its objective validity even if we should assume the impossible, that there is no God or that he does not care for human affairs."""
"This is the famous argument etiamsi daremus (non-esse Deum), that made natural law no longer dependent on theology."
"John Locke incorporated natural law into many of his theories and philosophy, especially in Two Treatises of Government."
"Locke turned Hobbes' prescription around, saying that if the ruler went against natural law and failed to protect ""life, liberty, and property,"" people could justifiably overthrow the existing state and create a new one."
The Belgian philosopher of law Frank van Dun is one among those who are elaborating a secular conception of natural law in the liberal tradition.
Civil and political rights are enshrined in articles 3 to 21 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICCPR.
"Economic, social and cultural rights are enshrined in articles 22 to 28 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and in the ICESCR."
"Western cultures have often given priority to civil and political rights, sometimes at the expense of economic and social rights such as the right to work, to education, health and housing."
"For example, in the United States there is no universal access to healthcare free at the point of use."
That is not to say that Western cultures have overlooked these rights entirely (the welfare states that exist in Western Europe are evidence of this).
"Similarly the ex Soviet bloc countries and Asian countries have tended to give priority to economic, social and cultural rights, but have often failed to provide civil and political rights."
"Another categorization, offered by Karel Vasak, is that there are three generations of human rights: first-generation civil and political rights (right to life and political participation), second-generation economic, social and cultural rights (right to subsistence) and third-generation solidarity rights (right to peace, right to clean environment)."
"Out of these generations, the third generation is the most debated and lacks both legal and political recognition."
"This categorisation is at odds with the indivisibility of rights, as it implicitly states that some rights can exist without others."
Prioritisation of rights for pragmatic reasons is however a widely accepted necessity.
"Priorities, where necessary, should adhere to core concepts (such as reasonable attempts at progressive realization) and principles (such as non-discrimination, equality and participation."
"Some human rights are said to be ""inalienable rights""."
"The term inalienable rights (or unalienable rights) refers to ""a set of human rights that are fundamental, are not awarded by human power, and cannot be surrendered""."
"The international community must treat human rights globally in a fair and equal manner, on the same footing, and with the same emphasis."
This statement was again endorsed at the 2005 World Summit in New York (paragraph 121).
"Proponents of cultural relativism suggest that human rights are not all universal, and indeed conflict with some cultures and threaten their survival."
Rights which are most often contested with relativistic arguments are the rights of women.
"For example, Female genital mutilation occurs in different cultures in Africa, Asia and South America."
"It is not mandated by any religion, but has become a tradition in many cultures."
"It is considered a violation of women's and girl's rights by much of the international community, and is outlawed in some countries."
"Universalism has been described by some as cultural, economic or political imperialism."
"In particular, the concept of human rights is often claimed to be fundamentally rooted in a politically liberal outlook which, although generally accepted in Europe, Japan or North America, is not necessarily taken as standard elsewhere."
"For example, in 1981, the Iranian representative to the United Nations, Said Rajaie-Khorassani, articulated the position of his country regarding the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by saying that the UDHR was ""a secular understanding of the Judeo-Christian tradition"", which could not be implemented by Muslims without trespassing the Islamic law."
"The former Prime Ministers of Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew, and of Malaysia, Mahathir bin Mohamad both claimed in the 1990s that Asian values were significantly different from western values and included a sense of loyalty and foregoing personal freedoms for the sake of social stability and prosperity, and therefore authoritarian government is more appropriate in Asia than democracy."
This reflects the fact that the difficulty in judging universalism versus relativism lies in who is claiming to represent a particular culture.
"Although the argument between universalism and relativism is far from complete, it is an academic discussion in that all international human rights instruments adhere to the principle that human rights are universally applicable."
"Non-State actors can also commit human rights abuses, but are not subject to human rights law other than International Humanitarian Law, which applies to individuals."
"Multi-national companies play an increasingly large role in the world, and are responsible for a large number of human rights abuses."
"Although the legal and moral environment surrounding the actions of governments is reasonably well developed, that surrounding multi-national companies is both controversial and ill-defined."
"Multi-national companies' primary responsibility is to their shareholders, not to those affected by their actions."
"Such companies are often larger than the economies of the states in which they operate, and can wield significant economic and political power."
"No international treaties exist to specifically cover the behavior of companies with regard to human rights, and national legislation is very variable."
In August 2003 the Human Rights Commission's Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights produced draft Norms on the responsibilities of transnational corporations and other business enterprises with regard to human rights.
"These were considered by the Human Rights Commission in 2004, but have no binding status on corporations and are not monitored."
"Additionally, the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 10 aims to substantially reduce inequality by 2030 through the promotion of appropriate legislation."
Such International law obligations are binding on all states and cannot be modified by treaty.
"In practice, many rights are very difficult to legally enforce due to the absence of consensus on the application of certain rights, the lack of relevant national legislation or of bodies empowered to take legal action to enforce them."
"The International Criminal Court is the body responsible for investigating and punishing war crimes, and Crimes against humanity when such occur within its jurisdiction, with a mandate to bring to justice perpetrators of such crimes that occurred after its creation in 2002."
"If national law is able to safeguard human rights and punish those who breach human rights legislation, it has primary jurisdiction by complementarity."
"Although not all NHRIs are compliant with the Paris Principles, the number and effect of these institutions is increasing."
"The Paris Principles were defined at the first International Workshop on National Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights in Paris on 7–9 October 1991, and adopted by United Nations Human Rights Commission Resolution 1992/54 of 1992 and the General Assembly Resolution 48/134 of 1993."
"The state backs its claim on the grounds that the crime committed is considered a crime against all, which any state is authorized to punish."
"The concept of universal jurisdiction is therefore closely linked to the idea that certain international norms are erga omnes, or owed to the entire world community, as well as the concept of jus cogens."
"In 1993 Belgium passed a law of universal jurisdiction to give its courts jurisdiction over crimes against humanity in other countries, and in 1998 Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London following an indictment by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzón under the universal jurisdiction principle."
"The principle is supported by Amnesty International and other human rights organisations as they believe certain crimes pose a threat to the international community as a whole and the community has a moral duty to act, but others, including Henry Kissinger (who has himself been accused of war crimes by several commentators), argue that state sovereignty is paramount, because breaches of rights committed in other countries are outside states' sovereign interest and because states could use the principle for political reasons."
In regard to human rights violations of United Nations laws.
Article 39 of the United Nations Charter designates the UN Security Council (or an appointed authority) as the only tribunal that may determine UN human rights violations.
These organisations collect evidence and documentation of human rights abuses and apply pressure to promote human rights.
"Wars of aggression, war crimes and crimes against humanity, including genocide, are breaches of International humanitarian law."
The Internet (or internet)  is the global system of interconnected computer networks that uses the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between networks and devices.
"It is a network of networks that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies."
"The Internet carries a vast range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and file sharing."
The origins of the Internet date back to the development of packet switching and research commissioned by the United States Department of Defense in the 1960s to enable time-sharing of computers.
"The primary precursor network, the ARPANET, initially served as a backbone for interconnection of regional academic and military networks in the 1970s."
"The funding of the National Science Foundation Network as a new backbone in the 1980s, as well as private funding for other commercial extensions, led to worldwide participation in the development of new networking technologies, and the merger of many networks."
"The linking of commercial networks and enterprises by the early 1990s marked the beginning of the transition to the modern Internet, and generated a sustained exponential growth as generations of institutional, personal, and mobile computers were connected to the network."
"Although the Internet was widely used by academia in the 1980s, commercialization incorporated its services and technologies into virtually every aspect of modern life."
"Most traditional communication media, including telephony, radio, television, paper mail and newspapers are reshaped, redefined, or even bypassed by the Internet, giving birth to new services such as email, Internet telephony, Internet television, online music, digital newspapers, and video streaming websites."
"Newspaper, book, and other print publishing are adapting to website technology, or are reshaped into blogging, web feeds and online news aggregators."
"The Internet has enabled and accelerated new forms of personal interactions through instant messaging, Internet forums, and social networking services."
"Online shopping has grown exponentially for major retailers, small businesses, and entrepreneurs, as it enables firms to extend their ""brick and mortar"" presence to serve a larger market or even sell goods and services entirely online."
Business-to-business and financial services on the Internet affect supply chains across entire industries.
The Internet has no single centralized governance in either technological implementation or policies for access and usage; each constituent network sets its own policies.
"The overreaching definitions of the two principal name spaces in the Internet, the Internet Protocol address (IP address) space and the Domain Name System (DNS), are directed by a maintainer organization, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)."
"The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise."
"In November 2006, the Internet was included on USA Today's list of New Seven Wonders."
"Today, the term Internet most commonly refers to the global system of interconnected computer networks, though it may also refer to any group of smaller networks."
"When it came into common use, most publications treated the word as a capitalized proper noun; this has become less common."
This reflects the tendency in English to capitalize new terms and move to lowercase as they become familiar.
"It is sometimes still capitalized to distinguish the global internet from smaller networks, though many publications, including the AP Stylebook, recommend the lowercase form in every case."
"However, the World Wide Web or the Web is only one of a large number of Internet services, a collection of documents (web pages) and other web resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs."
"Research into packet switching, one of the fundamental Internet technologies, started in the work of Paul Baran in the early 1960s and, independently, Donald Davies in 1965."
"The third site was the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center at the University of California, Santa Barbara, followed by the University of Utah Graphics Department."
"In a sign of future growth, 15 sites were connected to the young ARPANET by the end of 1971."
"Connections were made in 1973 to the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR) via a satellite station in Tanum, Sweden, and to Peter Kirstein's research group at University College London which provided a gateway to British academic networks."
"The ARPA projects and international working groups led to the development of various protocols and standards by which multiple separate networks could become a single network or ""a network of networks""."
"In 1974, Vint Cerf and Bob Kahn used the term internet as a shorthand for internetwork in RFC 675, and later RFCs repeated this use."
Cerf and Khan credit Louis Pouzin with important influences on TCP/IP design.
"In 1982, the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP) was standardized, which permitted worldwide proliferation of interconnected networks."
"The NSFNet expanded into academic and research organizations in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan in 1988–89."
"Although other network protocols such as UUCP had global reach well before this time, this marked the beginning of the Internet as an intercontinental network."
Commercial Internet service providers (ISPs) emerged in 1989 in the United States and Australia.
Steady advances in semiconductor technology and optical networking created new economic opportunities for commercial involvement in the expansion of the network in its core and for delivering services to the public.
"In mid-1989, MCI Mail and Compuserve established connections to the Internet, delivering email and public access products to the half million users of the Internet."
"Just months later, on 1 January 1990, PSInet launched an alternate Internet backbone for commercial use; one of the networks that added to the core of the commercial Internet of later years."
"Six months later Tim Berners-Lee would begin writing WorldWideWeb, the first web browser, after two years of lobbying CERN management."
"In 1991 the Commercial Internet eXchange was founded, allowing PSInet to communicate with the other commercial networks CERFnet and Alternet."
Stanford Federal Credit Union was the first financial institution to offer online Internet banking services to all of its members in October 1994.
"In 1996, OP Financial Group, also a cooperative bank, became the second online bank in the world and the first in Europe."
"As technology advanced and commercial opportunities fueled reciprocal growth, the volume of Internet traffic started experiencing similar characteristics as that of the scaling of MOS transistors, exemplified by Moore's law, doubling every 18 months."
"Increasing amounts of data are transmitted at higher and higher speeds over fiber optic networks operating at 1-Gbit/s, 10-Gbit/s, or more."
"The Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information and knowledge, commerce, entertainment and social networking services."
"During the late 1990s, it was estimated that traffic on the public Internet grew by 100 percent per year, while the mean annual growth in the number of Internet users was thought to be between 20% and 50%."
"This growth is often attributed to the lack of central administration, which allows organic growth of the network, as well as the non-proprietary nature of the Internet protocols, which encourages vendor interoperability and prevents any one company from exerting too much control over the network."
It is estimated that in 1993 the Internet carried only 1% of the information flowing through two-way telecommunication.
"By 2000 this figure had grown to 51%, and by 2007 more than 97% of all telecommunicated information was carried over the Internet."
It operates without a central governing body.
"The technical underpinning and standardization of the core protocols (IPv4 and IPv6) is an activity of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), a non-profit organization of loosely affiliated international participants that anyone may associate with by contributing technical expertise."
"To maintain interoperability, the principal name spaces of the Internet are administered by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)."
"ICANN is governed by an international board of directors drawn from across the Internet technical, business, academic, and other non-commercial communities."
"ICANN coordinates the assignment of unique identifiers for use on the Internet, including domain names, IP addresses, application port numbers in the transport protocols, and many other parameters."
Globally unified name spaces are essential for maintaining the global reach of the Internet.
"The African Network Information Center (AfriNIC) for Africa, the American Registry for Internet Numbers (ARIN) for North America, the Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC) for Asia and the Pacific region, the Latin American and Caribbean Internet Addresses Registry (LACNIC) for Latin America and the Caribbean region, and the Réseaux IP Européens – Network Coordination Centre (RIPE NCC) for Europe, the Middle East, and Central Asia were delegated to assign IP address blocks and other Internet parameters to local registries, such as Internet service providers, from a designated pool of addresses set aside for each region."
"The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, an agency of the United States Department of Commerce, had final approval over changes to the DNS root zone until the IANA stewardship transition on 1 October 2016."
"The Internet Society (ISOC) was founded in 1992 with a mission to ""assure the open development, evolution and use of the Internet for the benefit of all people throughout the world""."
"Its members include individuals (anyone may join) as well as corporations, organizations, governments, and universities."
"Among other activities ISOC provides an administrative home for a number of less formally organized groups that are involved in developing and managing the Internet, including: the IETF, Internet Architecture Board (IAB), Internet Engineering Steering Group (IESG), Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), and Internet Research Steering Group (IRSG)."
"On 16 November 2005, the United Nations-sponsored World Summit on the Information Society in Tunis established the Internet Governance Forum (IGF) to discuss Internet-related issues."
"As with any computer network, the Internet physically consists of routers, media (such as cabling and radio links), repeaters, modems etc."
"However, as an example of internetworking, many of the network nodes are not necessarily internet equipment per se, the internet packets are carried by other full-fledged networking protocols with the Internet acting as a homogeneous networking standard, running across heterogeneous hardware, with the packets guided to their destinations by IP routers."
"End-users who only access the Internet when needed to perform a function or obtain information, represent the bottom of the routing hierarchy."
"At the top of the routing hierarchy are the tier 1 networks, large telecommunication companies that exchange traffic directly with each other via very high speed fibre optic cables and governed by peering agreements."
"Tier 2 and lower level networks buy Internet transit from other providers to reach at least some parties on the global Internet, though they may also engage in peering."
"An ISP may use a single upstream provider for connectivity, or implement multihoming to achieve redundancy and load balancing."
Internet exchange points are major traffic exchanges with physical connections to multiple ISPs.
"Large organizations, such as academic institutions, large enterprises, and governments, may perform the same function as ISPs, engaging in peering and purchasing transit on behalf of their internal networks."
The Internet may often be accessed from computers in libraries and Internet cafes.
Internet access points exist in many public places such as airport halls and coffee shops.
"Various terms are used, such as public Internet kiosk, public access terminal, and Web payphone."
Many hotels also have public terminals that are usually fee-based.
"These terminals are widely accessed for various usages, such as ticket booking, bank deposit, or online payment."
Wi-Fi provides wireless access to the Internet via local computer networks.
"Hotspots providing such access include Wi-Fi cafes, where users need to bring their own wireless devices such as a laptop or PDA."
"These services may be free to all, free to customers only, or fee-based."
Grassroots efforts have led to wireless community networks.
"Commercial Wi-Fi services that cover large areas are available in many cities, such as New York, London, Vienna, Toronto, San Francisco, Philadelphia, Chicago and Pittsburgh, where the Internet can then be accessed from places such as a park bench."
"Experiments have also been conducted with proprietary mobile wireless networks like Ricochet, various high-speed data services over cellular networks, and fixed wireless services."
Modern smartphones can also access the Internet through the cellular carrier network.
"For Web browsing, these devices provide applications such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox and a wide variety of other Internet software may be installed from app-stores."
Internet usage by mobile and tablet devices exceeded desktop worldwide for the first time in October 2016.
Mobile Internet connectivity has played an important role in expanding access in recent years especially in Asia and the Pacific and in Africa.
"As of 2016, almost 60% of the world's population had access to a 4G broadband cellular network, up from almost 50% in 2015 and 11% in 2012."
The limits that users face on accessing information via mobile applications coincide with a broader process of fragmentation of the Internet.
"To address the issues with zero-rating, an alternative model has emerged in the concept of 'equal rating' and is being tested in experiments by Mozilla and Orange in Africa."
Equal rating prevents prioritization of one type of content and zero-rates all content up to a specified data cap.
"A study published by Chatham House, 15 out of 19 countries researched in Latin America had some kind of hybrid or zero-rated product offered."
"The study looked at the top three to five carriers by market share in Bangladesh, Colombia, Ghana, India, Kenya, Nigeria, Peru and Philippines."
"Across the 181 plans examined, 13 per cent were offering zero-rated services."
"Another study, covering Ghana, Kenya, Nigeria and South Africa, found Facebook's Free Basics and Wikipedia Zero to be the most commonly zero-rated content."
"This is a suite of protocols that are ordered into a set of four conceptional layers by the scope of their operation, originally documented in RFC 1122 and RFC 1123."
"At the top is the application layer, where communication is described in terms of the objects or data structures most appropriate for each application."
"For example, a web browser operates in a client-server application model and exchanges information with the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and an application-germane data structure, such as the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)."
"Below this top layer, the transport layer connects applications on different hosts with a logical channel through the network."
"It provides this service with a variety of possible characteristics, such ordered, reliable delivery (TCP), and an unreliable datagram service (UDP)."
Underlying these layers are the networking technologies that interconnect networks at their borders and exchange traffic across them.
"The Internet layer implements the Internet Protocol (IP) which enables computers to identify and locate each other by IP address, and route their traffic via intermediate (transit) networks."
The internet protocol layer code is independent of the type of network that it is physically running over.
"At the bottom of the architecture is the link layer, which connects nodes on the same physical link, and contains protocols that do not require routers for traversal to other links."
"The protocol suite does not explicitly specify hardware methods to transfer bits, or protocols to manage such hardware, but assumes that appropriate technology is available."
"Examples of that technology include Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and DSL."
"IP enables internetworking and, in essence, establishes the Internet itself."
"Two versions of the Internet Protocol exist, IPV4 and IPV6."
IP addresses are used by the Internet infrastructure to direct internet packets to their destinations.
"They consist of fixed-length numbers, which are found within the packet."
"IP addresses are generally assigned to equipment either automatically via DHCP, or are configured."
However the network also supports other addressing systems.
IPv4 is the initial version used on the first generation of the Internet and is still in dominant use.
"However, the explosive growth of the Internet has led to IPv4 address exhaustion, which entered its final stage in 2011, when the global IPv4 address allocation pool was exhausted."
IPv6 uses 128 bits for the IP address and was standardized in 1998.
"In essence, it establishes a parallel version of the Internet not directly accessible with IPv4 software."
"Thus, translation facilities must exist for internetworking or nodes must have duplicate networking software for both networks."
Essentially all modern computer operating systems support both versions of the Internet Protocol.
"Network infrastructure, however, has been lagging in this development."
"Indeed, the Internet is defined by its interconnections and routing policies."
The practice of dividing a network into two or more networks is called subnetting.
Computers that belong to a subnet are addressed with an identical most-significant bit-group in their IP addresses.
"This results in the logical division of an IP address into two fields, the network number or routing prefix and the rest field or host identifier."
The rest field is an identifier for a specific host or network interface.
"The routing prefix may be expressed in Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) notation written as the first address of a network, followed by a slash character (/), and ending with the bit-length of the prefix."
"The IPv6 address specification 2001:db8::/32 is a large address block with 296 addresses, having a 32-bit routing prefix."
"For IPv4, a network may also be characterized by its subnet mask or netmask, which is the bitmask that when applied by a bitwise AND operation to any IP address in the network, yields the routing prefix."
Subnet masks are also expressed in dot-decimal notation like an address.
Traffic is exchanged between subnetworks through routers when the routing prefixes of the source address and the destination address differ.
A router serves as a logical or physical boundary between the subnets.
The benefits of subnetting an existing network vary with each deployment scenario.
"In the address allocation architecture of the Internet using CIDR and in large organizations, it is necessary to allocate address space efficiently."
"Subnetting may also enhance routing efficiency, or have advantages in network management when subnetworks are administratively controlled by different entities in a larger organization."
"Subnets may be arranged logically in a hierarchical architecture, partitioning an organization's network address space into a tree-like routing structure."
Routing tables are maintained by manual configuration or automatically by routing protocols.
"End-nodes typically use a default route that points toward an ISP providing transit, while ISP routers use the Border Gateway Protocol to establish the most efficient routing across the complex connections of the global Internet."
The default gateway is the node that serves as the forwarding host (router) to other networks when no other route specification matches the destination IP address of a packet.
The responsibility for the architectural design of the Internet software systems has been assumed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF).
"The IETF conducts standard-setting work groups, open to any individual, about the various aspects of Internet architecture."
Resulting contributions and standards are published as Request for Comments (RFC) documents on the IETF web site.
The principal methods of networking that enable the Internet are contained in specially designated RFCs that constitute the Internet Standards.
"Other less rigorous documents are simply informative, experimental, or historical, or document the best current practices (BCP) when implementing Internet technologies."
"Most servers that provide these services are today hosted in data centers, and content is often accessed through high-performance content delivery networks."
"URIs symbolically identify services, web servers, databases, and the documents and resources that they can provide."
Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the main access protocol of the World Wide Web.
"These documents may also contain any combination of computer data, including graphics, sounds, text, video, multimedia and interactive content that runs while the user is interacting with the page."
"Client-side software can include animations, games, office applications and scientific demonstrations."
"Through keyword-driven Internet research using search engines like Yahoo!, Bing and Google, users worldwide have easy, instant access to a vast and diverse amount of online information."
"Compared to printed media, books, encyclopedias and traditional libraries, the World Wide Web has enabled the decentralization of information on a large scale."
The Web has enabled individuals and organizations to publish ideas and information to a potentially large audience online at greatly reduced expense and time delay.
"Publishing a web page, a blog, or building a website involves little initial cost and many cost-free services are available."
"However, publishing and maintaining large, professional web sites with attractive, diverse and up-to-date information is still a difficult and expensive proposition."
"Many individuals and some companies and groups use web logs or blogs, which are largely used as easily updatable online diaries."
"Some commercial organizations encourage staff to communicate advice in their areas of specialization in the hope that visitors will be impressed by the expert knowledge and free information, and be attracted to the corporation as a result."
"Advertising on popular web pages can be lucrative, and e-commerce, which is the sale of products and services directly via the Web, continues to grow."
Online advertising is a form of marketing and advertising which uses the Internet to deliver promotional marketing messages to consumers.
"It includes email marketing, search engine marketing (SEM), social media marketing, many types of display advertising (including web banner advertising), and mobile advertising."
"In 2011, Internet advertising revenues in the United States surpassed those of cable television and nearly exceeded those of broadcast television."
Many common online advertising practices are controversial and increasingly subject to regulation.
"When the Web developed in the 1990s, a typical web page was stored in completed form on a web server, formatted in HTML, complete for transmission to a web browser in response to a request."
"Over time, the process of creating and serving web pages has become dynamic, creating a flexible design, layout, and content."
"Websites are often created using content management software with, initially, very little content."
"Contributors to these systems, who may be paid staff, members of an organization or the public, fill underlying databases with content using editing pages designed for that purpose while casual visitors view and read this content in HTML form."
"There may or may not be editorial, approval and security systems built into the process of taking newly entered content and making it available to the target visitors."
"The concept of sending electronic text messages between parties, analogous to mailing letters or memos, predates the creation of the Internet."
"Pictures, documents, and other files are sent as email attachments."
Email messages can be cc-ed to multiple email addresses.
Internet telephony is a common communications service realized with the Internet.
"The name of the principle internetworking protocol, the Internet Protocol, lends its name to voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)."
The idea began in the early 1990s with walkie-talkie-like voice applications for personal computers.
"VoIP systems now dominate many markets, and are as easy to use and as convenient as a traditional telephone."
"The benefit has been in substantial cost savings over traditional telephone calls, especially over long distances."
"Cable, ADSL, and mobile data networks provide Internet access in customer premises and inexpensive VoIP network adapters provide the connection for traditional analog telephone sets."
The voice quality of VoIP often exceeds that of traditional calls.
"Remaining problems for VoIP include the situation that emergency services may not be universally available, and that devices rely on a local power supply, while older traditional phones are powered from the local loop, and typically operate during a power failure."
"A computer file can be emailed to customers, colleagues and friends as an attachment."
It can be uploaded to a website or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server for easy download by others.
"It can be put into a ""shared location"" or onto a file server for instant use by colleagues."
"The load of bulk downloads to many users can be eased by the use of ""mirror"" servers or peer-to-peer networks."
"In any of these cases, access to the file may be controlled by user authentication, the transit of the file over the Internet may be obscured by encryption, and money may change hands for access to the file."
"The price can be paid by the remote charging of funds from, for example, a credit card whose details are also passed—usually fully encrypted—across the Internet."
The origin and authenticity of the file received may be checked by digital signatures or by MD5 or other message digests.
"These simple features of the Internet, over a worldwide basis, are changing the production, sale, and distribution of anything that can be reduced to a computer file for transmission."
"This includes all manner of print publications, software products, news, music, film, video, photography, graphics and the other arts."
This in turn has caused seismic shifts in each of the existing industries that previously controlled the production and distribution of these products.
Streaming media is the real-time delivery of digital media for the immediate consumption or enjoyment by end users.
Many radio and television broadcasters provide Internet feeds of their live audio and video productions.
"They may also allow time-shift viewing or listening such as Preview, Classic Clips and Listen Again features."
"These providers have been joined by a range of pure Internet ""broadcasters"" who never had on-air licenses."
"This means that an Internet-connected device, such as a computer or something more specific, can be used to access on-line media in much the same way as was previously possible only with a television or radio receiver."
"The range of available types of content is much wider, from specialized technical webcasts to on-demand popular multimedia services."
"Podcasting is a variation on this theme, where—usually audio—material is downloaded and played back on a computer or shifted to a portable media player to be listened to on the move."
"These techniques using simple equipment allow anybody, with little censorship or licensing control, to broadcast audio-visual material worldwide."
Digital media streaming increases the demand for network bandwidth.
"While some webcams can give full-frame-rate video, the picture either is usually small or updates slowly."
"Internet users can watch animals around an African waterhole, ships in the Panama Canal, traffic at a local roundabout or monitor their own premises, live and in real time."
"Video chat rooms and video conferencing are also popular with many uses being found for personal webcams, with and without two-way sound."
YouTube was founded on 15 February 2005 and is now the leading website for free streaming video with more than two billion users.
It uses an HTML5 based web player by default to stream and show video files.
Registered users may upload an unlimited amount of video and build their own personal profile.
"YouTube claims that its users watch hundreds of millions, and upload hundreds of thousands of videos daily."
This phenomenon has given rise to the scholarly study of the sociology of the Internet.
"By 2010, 22 percent of the world's population had access to computers with 1 billion Google searches every day, 300 million Internet users reading blogs, and 2 billion videos viewed daily on YouTube."
"The number of China's Internet users surpassed a major milestone in 2018, when the country's Internet regulatory authority, China Internet Network Information Centre, announced that China had 802 million Internet users."
"By 2019, China was the world's leading country in terms of Internet users, with more than 800 million users, followed closely by India, with some 700 million users, with the United States a distant third with 275 million users."
"This may be a result of the origin of the Internet, as well as the language's role as a lingua franca and as a world language."
"Early computer systems were limited to the characters in the American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII), a subset of the Latin alphabet."
"After English (27%), the most requested languages on the World Wide Web are Chinese (25%), Spanish (8%), Japanese (5%), Portuguese and German (4% each), Arabic, French and Russian (3% each), and Korean (2%)."
"By region, 42% of the world's Internet users are based in Asia, 24% in Europe, 14% in North America, 10% in Latin America and the Caribbean taken together, 6% in Africa, 3% in the Middle East and 1% in Australia/Oceania."
"The Internet's technologies have developed enough in recent years, especially in the use of Unicode, that good facilities are available for development and communication in the world's widely used languages."
"However, some glitches such as mojibake (incorrect display of some languages' characters) still remain."
"In an American study in 2005, the percentage of men using the Internet was very slightly ahead of the percentage of women, although this difference reversed in those under 30."
"Men logged on more often, spent more time online, and were more likely to be broadband users, whereas women tended to make more use of opportunities to communicate (such as email)."
"Men were more likely to use the Internet to pay bills, participate in auctions, and for recreation such as downloading music and videos."
Men and women were equally likely to use the Internet for shopping and banking.
"More recent studies indicate that in 2008, women significantly outnumbered men on most social networking services, such as Facebook and Myspace, although the ratios varied with age."
"In addition, women watched more streaming content, whereas men downloaded more."
"The Internet can be accessed almost anywhere by numerous means, including through mobile Internet devices."
"Mobile phones, datacards, handheld game consoles and cellular routers allow users to connect to the Internet wirelessly."
"Within the limitations imposed by small screens and other limited facilities of such pocket-sized devices, the services of the Internet, including email and the web, may be available."
Service providers may restrict the services offered and mobile data charges may be significantly higher than other access methods.
Educational material at all levels from pre-school to post-doctoral is available from websites.
"Examples range from CBeebies, through school and high-school revision guides and virtual universities, to access to top-end scholarly literature through the likes of Google Scholar."
"For distance education, help with homework and other assignments, self-guided learning, whiling away spare time or just looking up more detail on an interesting fact, it has never been easier for people to access educational information at any level from anywhere."
The Internet in general and the World Wide Web in particular are important enablers of both formal and informal education.
Not only can a group cheaply communicate and share ideas but the wide reach of the Internet allows such groups more easily to form.
"Internet chat, whether using an IRC chat room, an instant messaging system, or a social networking service, allows colleagues to stay in touch in a very convenient way while working at their computers during the day."
Messages can be exchanged even more quickly and conveniently than via email.
"These systems may allow files to be exchanged, drawings and images to be shared, or voice and video contact between team members."
Content management systems allow collaborating teams to work on shared sets of documents simultaneously without accidentally destroying each other's work.
Business and project teams can share calendars as well as documents and other information.
"Such collaboration occurs in a wide variety of areas including scientific research, software development, conference planning, political activism and creative writing."
Social and political collaboration is also becoming more widespread as both Internet access and computer literacy spread.
The Internet allows computer users to remotely access other computers and information stores easily from any access point.
"authentication and encryption technologies, depending on the requirements."
"This is encouraging new ways of working from home, collaboration and information sharing in many industries."
"An accountant sitting at home can audit the books of a company based in another country, on a server situated in a third country that is remotely maintained by IT specialists in a fourth."
"These accounts could have been created by home-working bookkeepers, in other remote locations, based on information emailed to them from offices all over the world."
"Some of these things were possible before the widespread use of the Internet, but the cost of private leased lines would have made many of them infeasible in practice."
"An office worker away from their desk, perhaps on the other side of the world on a business trip or a holiday, can access their emails, access their data using cloud computing, or open a remote desktop session into their office PC using a secure virtual private network (VPN) connection on the Internet."
"This can give the worker complete access to all of their normal files and data, including email and other applications, while away from the office."
"It has been referred to among system administrators as the Virtual Private Nightmare, because it extends the secure perimeter of a corporate network into remote locations and its employees' homes."
"By late 2010s Internet has been described as ""the main source of scientific information ""for the majority of the global North population""."
"People use chat, messaging and email to make and stay in touch with friends worldwide, sometimes in the same way as some previously had pen pals."
Social networking services such as Facebook have created new ways to socialize and interact.
"Users of these sites are able to add a wide variety of information to pages, to pursue common interests, and to connect with others."
"It is also possible to find existing acquaintances, to allow communication among existing groups of people."
Sites like LinkedIn foster commercial and business connections.
YouTube and Flickr specialize in users' videos and photographs.
"Social networking services are also widely used by businesses and other organizations to promote their brands, to market to their customers and to encourage posts to ""go viral""."
"""Black hat"" social media techniques are also employed by some organizations, such as spam accounts and astroturfing."
"A risk for both individuals and organizations writing posts (especially public posts) on social networking services, is that especially foolish or controversial posts occasionally lead to an unexpected and possibly large-scale backlash on social media from other Internet users."
"This is also a risk in relation to controversial offline behavior, if it is widely made known."
"The nature of this backlash can range widely from counter-arguments and public mockery, through insults and hate speech, to, in extreme cases, rape and death threats."
The online disinhibition effect describes the tendency of many individuals to behave more stridently or offensively online than they would in person.
"However, this is not always the case, as any brand damage in the eyes of people with an opposing opinion to that presented by the organization could sometimes be outweighed by strengthening the brand in the eyes of others."
"Furthermore, if an organization or individual gives in to demands that others perceive as wrong-headed, that can then provoke a counter-backlash."
"Some websites, such as Reddit, have rules forbidding the posting of personal information of individuals (also known as doxxing), due to concerns about such postings leading to mobs of large numbers of Internet users directing harassment at the specific individuals thereby identified."
"In particular, the Reddit rule forbidding the posting of personal information is widely understood to imply that all identifying photos and names must be censored in Facebook screenshots posted to Reddit."
"However, the interpretation of this rule in relation to public Twitter posts is less clear, and in any case, like-minded people online have many other ways they can use to direct each other's attention to public social media posts they disagree with."
"Children also face dangers online such as cyberbullying and approaches by sexual predators, who sometimes pose as children themselves."
"Children may also encounter material which they may find upsetting, or material which their parents consider to be not age-appropriate."
"Due to naivety, they may also post personal information about themselves online, which could put them or their families at risk unless warned not to do so."
"Many parents choose to enable Internet filtering, and/or supervise their children's online activities, in an attempt to protect their children from inappropriate material on the Internet."
"The most popular social networking services, such as Facebook and Twitter, commonly forbid users under the age of 13."
"However, these policies are typically trivial to circumvent by registering an account with a false birth date, and a significant number of children aged under 13 join such sites anyway."
Many Internet forums have sections devoted to games and funny videos.
The Internet pornography and online gambling industries have taken advantage of the World Wide Web.
"This form of recreation creates communities, where people of all ages and origins enjoy the fast-paced world of multiplayer games."
"These range from MMORPG to first-person shooters, from role-playing video games to online gambling."
"While online gaming has been around since the 1970s, modern modes of online gaming began with subscription services such as GameSpy and MPlayer."
Non-subscribers were limited to certain types of game play or certain games.
"Many people use the Internet to access and download music, movies and other works for their enjoyment and relaxation."
"Free and fee-based services exist for all of these activities, using centralized servers and distributed peer-to-peer technologies."
Some of these sources exercise more care with respect to the original artists' copyrights than others.
Internet usage has been correlated to users' loneliness.
"Lonely people tend to use the Internet as an outlet for their feelings and to share their stories with others, such as in the ""I am lonely will anyone speak to me"" thread."
"A 2017 book claimed that the Internet consolidates most aspects of human endeavor into singular arenas of which all of humanity are potential members and competitors, with fundamentally negative impacts on mental health as a result."
"While successes in each field of activity are pervasively visible and trumpeted, they are reserved for an extremely thin sliver of the world's most exceptional, leaving everyone else behind."
"Overseas supporters provide funding and support; domestic practitioners distribute tracts, participate in acts of resistance, and share information on the internal situation with outsiders."
"Collectively, members and practitioners of such sects construct viable virtual communities of faith, exchanging personal testimonies and engaging in the collective study via email, on-line chat rooms, and web-based message boards."""
"In particular, the British government has raised concerns about the prospect of young British Muslims being indoctrinated into Islamic extremism by material on the Internet, being persuaded to join terrorist groups such as the so-called ""Islamic State"", and then potentially committing acts of terrorism on returning to Britain after fighting in Syria or Iraq."
"Cyberslacking can become a drain on corporate resources; the average UK employee spent 57 minutes a day surfing the Web while at work, according to a 2003 study by Peninsula Business Services."
Internet addiction disorder is excessive computer use that interferes with daily life.
E-commerce seeks to add revenue streams using the Internet to build and enhance relationships with clients and partners.
"According to International Data Corporation, the size of worldwide e-commerce, when global business-to-business and -consumer transactions are combined, equate to $16 trillion for 2013."
Keen cites a 2013 Institute for Local Self-Reliance report saying brick-and-mortar retailers employ 47 people for every $10 million in sales while Amazon employs only 14.
"Similarly, the 700-employee room rental start-up Airbnb was valued at $10 billion in 2014, about half as much as Hilton Worldwide, which employs 152,000 people."
"It can be efficient and useful for companies as it allows workers to communicate over long distances, saving significant amounts of travel time and cost."
"As broadband Internet connections become commonplace, more workers have adequate bandwidth at home to use these tools to link their home to their corporate intranet and internal communication networks."
"In those settings, they have been found useful for collaboration on grant writing, strategic planning, departmental documentation, and committee work."
The United States Patent and Trademark Office uses a wiki to allow the public to collaborate on finding prior art relevant to examination of pending patent applications.
"Queens, New York has used a wiki to allow citizens to collaborate on the design and planning of a local park."
The English Wikipedia has the largest user base among wikis on the World Wide Web and ranks in the top 10 among all Web sites in terms of traffic.
The presidential campaign of Howard Dean in 2004 in the United States was notable for its success in soliciting donation via the Internet.
"Many political groups use the Internet to achieve a new method of organizing for carrying out their mission, having given rise to Internet activism, most notably practiced by rebels in the Arab Spring."
"However, incidents of politically motivated Internet censorship have now been recorded in many countries, including western democracies."
"Websites, such as DonorsChoose and GlobalGiving, allow small-scale donors to direct funds to individual projects of their choice."
A popular twist on Internet-based philanthropy is the use of peer-to-peer lending for charitable purposes.
"Kiva pioneered this concept in 2005, offering the first web-based service to publish individual loan profiles for funding."
Kiva raises funds for local intermediary microfinance organizations which post stories and updates on behalf of the borrowers.
"Lenders can contribute as little as $25 to loans of their choice, and receive their money back as borrowers repay."
"Kiva falls short of being a pure peer-to-peer charity, in that loans are disbursed before being funded by lenders and borrowers do not communicate with lenders themselves."
"It includes computer viruses which are copied with the help of humans, computer worms which copy themselves automatically, software for denial of service attacks, ransomware, botnets, and spyware that reports on the activity and typing of users."
Defense theorists have also speculated about the possibilities of hackers using cyber warfare using similar methods on a large scale.
"In the United States for example, under the Communications Assistance For Law Enforcement Act, all phone calls and broadband Internet traffic (emails, web traffic, instant messaging, etc.)"
are required to be available for unimpeded real-time monitoring by Federal law enforcement agencies.
Packet capture is the monitoring of data traffic on a computer network.
"Computers communicate over the Internet by breaking up messages (emails, images, videos, web pages, files, etc.)"
"into small chunks called ""packets"", which are routed through a network of computers, until they reach their destination, where they are assembled back into a complete ""message"" again."
"Packet Capture Appliance intercepts these packets as they are traveling through the network, in order to examine their contents using other programs."
"A packet capture is an information gathering tool, but not an analysis tool."
"That is it gathers ""messages"" but it does not analyze them and figure out what they mean."
Other programs are needed to perform traffic analysis and sift through intercepted data looking for important/useful information.
Similar systems are operated by Iranian secret police to identify and suppress dissidents.
The required hardware and software was allegedly installed by German Siemens AG and Finnish Nokia.
"While this list of forbidden resources is supposed to contain only known child pornography sites, the content of the list is secret."
"Many countries, including the United States, have enacted laws against the possession or distribution of certain material, such as child pornography, via the Internet, but do not mandate filter software."
"Many free or commercially available software programs, called content-control software are available to users to block offensive websites on individual computers or networks, in order to limit access by children to pornographic material or depiction of violence."
It exhibits emergent phenomena that depend on its large-scale organization.
"Traffic data may be estimated from the aggregate volume through the peering points of the Tier 1 network providers, but traffic that stays local in large provider networks may not be accounted for."
"Disruptions of submarine communications cables may cause blackouts or slowdowns to large areas, such as in the 2008 submarine cable disruption."
Less-developed countries are more vulnerable due to a small number of high-capacity links.
"Land cables are also vulnerable, as in 2011 when a woman digging for scrap metal severed most connectivity for the nation of Armenia."
"Internet blackouts affecting almost entire countries can be achieved by governments as a form of Internet censorship, as in the blockage of the Internet in Egypt, whereby approximately 93% of networks were without access in 2011 in an attempt to stop mobilization for anti-government protests."
"This estimate included the energy needed to build, operate, and periodically replace the estimated 750 million laptops, a billion smart phones and 100 million servers worldwide as well as the energy that routers, cell towers, optical switches, Wi-Fi transmitters and cloud storage devices use when transmitting Internet traffic."
The war began on 25 June 1950 when North Korea invaded South Korea following clashes along the border and insurrections in the south.
"After the surrender of Japan, at the end of World War II, on 15 August 1945, Korea was divided at the 38th parallel into two zones of occupation."
The Soviets administered the northern-half and the Americans administered the southern-half.
"In 1948, as a result of Cold War tensions, the occupation zones became two sovereign states."
A socialist state was established in the north under the totalitarian leadership of Kim Il-sung and a capitalist state in the south under the authoritarian leadership of Syngman Rhee.
"Both governments of the two new Korean states claimed to be the sole legitimate government of all of Korea, and neither accepted the border as permanent."
"North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces crossed the border and advanced into South Korea on 25 June 1950."
"The United Nations Security Council denounced the North Korean move as an invasion, and authorized the formation of the United Nations Command and the dispatch of forces to Korea to repel it."
"These UN decisions were taken without participation of the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China, both of which supported North Korea."
"As a result, the ROKA and US troops retreated to a small area behind a defensive line known as the Pusan Perimeter."
"In September 1950, an amphibious UN counter-offensive was launched at Incheon, and cut off many KPA troops in South Korea."
Those who escaped envelopment and capture were forced back north.
"UN forces invaded North Korea in October 1950 and moved rapidly towards the Yalu River—the border with China—but on 19 October 1950, Chinese forces of the People's Volunteer Army (PVA) crossed the Yalu and entered the war."
The surprise Chinese intervention triggered a retreat of UN forces and Chinese forces were in South Korea by late December.
"In these and subsequent battles, Seoul was captured four times, and communist forces were pushed back to positions around the 38th parallel, close to where the war started."
After this the front stabilized and the last two years of fighting became a war of attrition.
"The war in the air, however, was never a stalemate."
North Korea was subject to a massive US bombing campaign.
"Jet fighters confronted each other in air-to-air combat for the first time in history, and Soviet pilots covertly flew in defense of their communist allies."
The fighting ended on 27 July 1953 when the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed.
"The agreement created the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) to separate North and South Korea, and allowed the return of prisoners."
"However, no peace treaty was ever signed, and the two Koreas are technically still at war, engaged in a frozen conflict."
"It incurred the destruction of virtually all of Korea's major cities, thousands of massacres by both sides, including the mass killing of tens of thousands of suspected communists by the South Korean government, and the torture and starvation of prisoners of war by the North Korean command."
North Korea became among the most heavily bombed countries in history.
"It has been sometimes referred to in the English-speaking world as ""The Forgotten War"" or ""The Unknown War"" because of the lack of public attention it received both during and after the war, relative to the global scale of World War II, which preceded it, and the subsequent angst of the Vietnam War, which succeeded it."
The Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was founded in 1919 in Nationalist China.
"It failed to achieve international recognition, failed to unite nationalist groups, and had a fractious relationship with its US-based founding president, Syngman Rhee."
"The Nationalist-backed Koreans, led by Yi Pom-Sok, fought in the Burma Campaign (December 1941 – August 1945)."
"Germany officially surrendered on 8 May 1945, and the USSR declared war on Japan on 8 August 1945, three months later."
This was three days after the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.
This was incorporated into the US General Order No.
1 which responded to the Japanese surrender on 15 August.
"He noted that he was ""faced with the scarcity of US forces immediately available, and time and space factors, which would make it difficult to reach very far north, before Soviet troops could enter the area""."
"As Rusk's comments indicate, the US doubted whether the Soviet government would agree to this."
"Appointed as military governor, Hodge directly controlled South Korea as head of the United States Army Military Government in Korea (USAMGIK 1945–48)."
"He attempted to establish control by restoring Japanese colonial administrators to power, but in the face of Korean protests quickly reversed this decision."
Hodge did keep in governmental positions a large number of Koreans who had directly served and collaborated with the Japanese colonial government.
"This presence was particularly pronounced in the Korean National Police Force, who would later suppress widespread rebellions to the ROK."
The USAMGIK refused to recognize the provisional government of the short-lived People's Republic of Korea (PRK) due to its suspected Communist sympathies.
"In December 1945, Korea was administered by a US-Soviet Union Joint Commission, as agreed at the Moscow Conference, with the aim of granting independence after a five-year trusteeship."
The idea was not popular among Koreans and riots broke out.
"To contain them, the USAMGIK banned strikes on 8 December 1945 and outlawed the PRK Revolutionary Government and the PRK People's Committees on 12 December 1945."
"Following further large-scale civilian unrest, the USAMGIK declared martial law."
"Citing the inability of the Joint Commission to make progress, the US government decided to hold an election under United Nations auspices with the aim of creating an independent Korea."
"The Soviet authorities and the Korean Communists refused to co-operate on the grounds it would not be fair, and many South Korean politicians boycotted it."
A general election was held in the South on 10 May 1948.
This election is generally considered to have been manipulated by the Rhee regime.
The Republic of Korea (South Korea) was established on 15 August 1948.
"While the Communists were struggling for supremacy in Manchuria, they were supported by the North Korean government with matériel and manpower."
"According to Chinese sources, the North Koreans donated 2,000 railway cars worth of supplies while thousands of Koreans served in the Chinese PLA during the war."
"As a token of gratitude, between 50,000 and 70,000 Korean veterans that served in the PLA were sent back along with their weapons, and they later played a significant role in the initial invasion of South Korea."
"Basing this judgment on China's century of humiliation beginning in the mid-19th century, US support for the Nationalists during the Chinese Civil War, and the ideological struggles between revolutionaries and reactionaries, the PRC Chinese leadership believed that China would become a critical battleground in the US' crusade against Communism."
"As a countermeasure and to elevate China's standing among the worldwide Communist movements, the PRC leadership adopted a foreign policy that actively promoted Communist revolutions throughout territories on China's periphery."
"This was exacerbated by the ongoing undeclared border war between the Koreas, which saw division level engagements and thousands of deaths on both sides."
"The ROK in this time was almost entirely trained and focused in counterinsurgency, rather than conventional warfare."
"They were equipped and advised by a force of a few hundred American officers, who were largely successful in helping the ROKA to subdue guerrillas and hold its own against North Korean military (Korean People's Army, KPA) forces along the 38th parallel."
"Beginning in April 1948 on the isolated island of Jeju, the campaign saw mass arrests and repression by the South Korean government in the fight against the South Korean Labor Party, resulting in a total of 30,000 violent deaths, among them 14,373 civilians (of whom ~2,000 were killed by rebels and ~12,000 by ROK security forces)."
"The Yeosu–Suncheon rebellion overlapped with it, as several thousand army defectors waving red flags massacred right-leaning families."
"This resulted in another brutal suppression by the government and between 2,976 and 3,392 deaths."
"Insurgency reignited in the spring of 1949, when attacks by guerrillas in the mountainous regions (buttressed by army defectors and North Korean agents) increased."
Insurgent activity peaked in late 1949 as the ROKA engaged so-called People's Guerrilla Units.
"Organized and armed by the North Korean government, and backed up by 2,400 KPA commandos who had infiltrated through the border, these guerrillas launched a large offensive in September aimed at undermining the South Korean government and preparing the country for the KPA's arrival in force."
This offensive failed.
"Serious border clashes between South and North continued on 4 August 1949, when thousands of North Korean troops attacked South Korean troops occupying territory north of the 38th Parallel."
"The 2nd and 18th ROK Infantry Regiments repulsed initial attacks in Kuksa-bong (above the 38th Parallel) and Ch'ungmu, and at the end of the clashes ROK troops were ""completely routed""."
"North Korea responded by sending more troops to link up with existing insurgents and build more partisan cadres; the number of North Korean infiltrators had reached 3,000 men in 12 units by the start of 1950, but all of these units were destroyed or scattered by the ROKA."
This operation crippled the insurgency.
"Soon after, the North Koreans made two final attempts to keep the uprising active, sending two battalion-sized units of infiltrators under the commands of Kim Sang-ho and Kim Moo-hyon."
The first battalion was annihilated to a man over the course of several engagements by the ROKA 8th Division.
"The second battalion was annihilated by a two-battalion hammer-and-anvil maneuver by units of the ROKA 6th Division, resulting in a loss toll of 584 KPA guerrillas (480 killed, 104 captured) and 69 ROKA troops killed, plus 184 wounded."
"By spring of 1950, guerrilla activity had mostly subsided; the border, too, was calm."
"However, Kim Il-sung believed that widespread uprisings had weakened the South Korean military and that a North Korean invasion would be welcomed by much of the South Korean population."
"PLA forces were still embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, while US forces remained stationed in South Korea."
"By spring 1950, he believed that the strategic situation had changed: PLA forces under Mao Zedong had secured final victory in China, US forces had withdrawn from Korea, and the Soviets had detonated their first nuclear bomb, breaking the US atomic monopoly."
"As the US had not directly intervened to stop the communist victory in China, Stalin calculated that they would be even less willing to fight in Korea, which had much less strategic significance."
"The Soviets had also cracked the codes used by the US to communicate with their embassy in Moscow, and reading these dispatches convinced Stalin that Korea did not have the importance to the US that would warrant a nuclear confrontation."
"For Kim, this was the fulfillment of his goal to unite Korea after its division by foreign powers."
"Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces would not openly engage in combat, to avoid a direct war with the US."
Mao was concerned the US would intervene but agreed to support the North Korean invasion.
China desperately needed the economic and military aid promised by the Soviets.
"However, Mao sent more ethnic Korean PLA veterans to Korea and promised to move an army closer to the Korean border."
These generals completed the plans for the attack by May.
The original plans called for a skirmish to be initiated in the Ongjin Peninsula on the west coast of Korea.
The North Koreans would then launch a counterattack that would capture Seoul and encircle and destroy the ROK.
"On 11 June, the North sent three diplomats to the South as a peace overture that Rhee rejected outright."
"On 21 June, Kim Il-Sung revised his war plan to involve a general attack across the 38th Parallel, rather than a limited operation in the Ongjin Peninsula."
Kim was concerned that South Korean agents had learned about the plans and that South Korean forces were strengthening their defenses.
The ROK was being trained by the US Korean Military Advisory Group (KMAG).
"On the eve of war, KMAG commander General William Lynn Roberts voiced utmost confidence in the ROK and boasted that any North Korean invasion would merely provide ""target practice""."
"The Central Intelligence Agency noted the southward movement by the KPA, but assessed this as a ""defensive measure"" and concluded an invasion was ""unlikely""."
"On 23 June, UN observers inspected the border and did not detect that war was imminent."
"After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War, ethnic Korean units in the PLA were sent to North Korea."
"Chinese involvement was extensive from the beginning, building on previous collaboration between the Chinese and Korean communists during the Chinese Civil War."
"In the fall of 1949, two PLA divisions composed mainly of Korean-Chinese troops (the 164th and 166th) entered North Korea, followed by smaller units throughout the rest of 1949; these troops brought with them not only their experience and training, but their weapons and other equipment, changing little but their uniforms."
"The reinforcement of the KPA with PLA veterans continued into 1950, with the 156th division and several other units of the former Fourth Field Army arriving (also with their equipment) in February; the PLA 156th Division was reorganized as the KPA 7th Division."
"By mid-1950, between 50,000 and 70,000 former PLA troops had entered North Korea, forming a significant part of the KPA's strength on the eve of the war's beginning."
"Several generals, such as Lee Kwon-mu, were PLA veterans born to ethnic Koreans in China."
"The combat veterans and equipment from China, the tanks, artillery and aircraft supplied by the Soviets, and rigorous training increased North Korea's military superiority over the South, armed by the US military with mostly small arms, but no heavy weaponry such as tanks."
"While older histories of the conflict often referred to these ethnic Korean PLA veterans as being sent from northern Korea to fight in the Chinese Civil War before being sent back, recent Chinese archival sources studied by Kim Donggill indicate that this was not the case."
"Their forces included 274 T-34-85 tanks, 200 artillery pieces, 110 attack bombers, and some 150 Yak fighter planes, and 35 reconnaissance aircraft."
"In addition to the invasion force, the North had 114 fighters, 78 bombers, 105 T-34-85 tanks, and some 30,000 soldiers stationed in reserve in North Korea."
"Although each navy consisted of only several small warships, the North and South Korean navies fought in the war as sea-borne artillery for their armies."
"In contrast, the South Korean population was estimated at 20 million and its army was unprepared and ill-equipped."
"As of 25 June 1950 the ROK had 98,000 soldiers (65,000 combat, 33,000 support), no tanks (they had been requested from the US military, but requests were denied), and a 22-plane air force comprising 12 liaison-type and 10 AT-6 advanced-trainer airplanes."
"Large US garrisons and air forces were in Japan, but only 200–300 US troops were in Korea."
"The KPA justified its assault with the claim that ROK troops attacked first and that the KPA were aiming to arrest and execute the ""bandit traitor Syngman Rhee""."
Fighting began on the strategic Ongjin Peninsula in the west.
The KPA had a combined arms force including tanks supported by heavy artillery.
"The bridge was detonated while 4,000 refugees were crossing it and hundreds were killed."
Destroying the bridge also trapped many ROK units north of the Han River.
"In spite of such desperate measures, Seoul fell that same day."
"In early July, when US forces arrived, what was left of the ROK were placed under US operational command of the United Nations Command."
Korea was not included in the strategic Asian Defense Perimeter outlined by United States Secretary of State Dean Acheson.
"Truman himself was at his home in Independence, Missouri."
Military strategists were more concerned with the security of Europe against the Soviet Union than East Asia.
"At the same time, the administration was worried that a war in Korea could quickly widen into another world war should the Chinese or Soviets decide to get involved."
"While there was initial hesitance by some in the US government to get involved in the war, considerations about Japan played a part in the ultimate decision to engage on behalf of South Korea."
"Especially after the fall of China to the Communists, US experts on East Asia saw Japan as the critical counterweight to the Soviet Union and China in the region."
"While there was no US policy dealing with South Korea directly as a national interest, its proximity to Japan increased the importance of South Korea."
"""Another major consideration was the possible Soviet reaction in the event that the US intervened."
The Truman administration was fearful that a war in Korea was a diversionary assault that would escalate to a general war in Europe once the United States committed in Korea.
"Yugoslavia—a possible Soviet target because of the Tito-Stalin Split—was vital to the defense of Italy and Greece, and the country was first on the list of the National Security Council's post-North Korea invasion list of ""chief danger spots""."
"Truman believed if aggression went unchecked, a chain reaction would be initiated that would marginalize the UN and encourage Communist aggression elsewhere."
"The UN Security Council approved the use of force to help the South Koreans, and the US immediately began using what air and naval forces that were in the area to that end."
The decision to commit ground troops became viable when a communiqué was received on 27 June indicating the Soviet Union would not move against US forces in Korea.
The Truman administration now believed it could intervene in Korea without undermining its commitments elsewhere.
"The Soviet Union, a veto-wielding power, had boycotted the Council meetings since January 1950, protesting that the Taiwanese Republic of China and not the mainland People's Republic of China held a permanent seat in the UN Security Council."
"After debating the matter, the Security Council, on 27 June 1950, published Resolution 83 recommending member states provide military assistance to the Republic of Korea."
On 27 June President Truman ordered US air and sea forces to help South Korea.
"The ROK intelligence upon which Resolution 83 was based came from US Intelligence; North Korea was not invited as a sitting temporary member of the UN, which violated UN Charter Article 32; and the fighting was beyond the UN Charter's scope, because the initial north–south border fighting was classed as a civil war."
"Truman and Acheson discussed a US invasion response and agreed that the US was obligated to act, paralleling the North Korean invasion with Adolf Hitler's aggressions in the 1930s, with the conclusion being that the mistake of appeasement must not be repeated."
"Several US industries were mobilized to supply materials, labor, capital, production facilities, and other services necessary to support the military objectives of the Korean War."
"I felt certain that if South Korea was allowed to fall, Communist leaders would be emboldened to override nations closer to our own shores."
"If the Communists were permitted to force their way into the Republic of Korea without opposition from the free world, no small nation would have the courage to resist threat and aggression by stronger Communist neighbors."
"The President disagreed with advisers who recommended unilateral US bombing of the North Korean forces, and ordered the US Seventh Fleet to protect the Republic of China (Taiwan), whose government asked to fight in Korea."
"The United States denied Taiwan's request for combat, lest it provoke a PRC retaliation."
"Because the United States had sent the Seventh Fleet to ""neutralize"" the Taiwan Strait, Chinese premier Zhou Enlai criticized both the UN and US initiatives as ""armed aggression on Chinese territory""."
"On 5 July 1950, Task Force Smith attacked the KPA at Osan but without weapons capable of destroying the KPA tanks."
"The KPA defeated the US soldiers; the result was 180 American dead, wounded, or taken prisoner."
"The impact of the Truman administration's defense budget cutbacks were now keenly felt, as US troops fought a series of costly rearguard actions."
"Facing a veteran and well led KPA force, and lacking sufficient anti-tank weapons, artillery or armor, the Americans retreated and the KPA advanced down the Korean Peninsula."
"During their advance, the KPA purged South Korea's intelligentsia by killing civil servants and intellectuals."
"On 20 August, General MacArthur warned North Korean leader Kim Il-sung that he would be held responsible for the KPA's atrocities."
"By September, UN forces were hemmed into a small corner of southeast Korea, near Pusan."
"This 140 miles (230 km) perimeter enclosed about 10% of Korea, in a line partially defined by the Nakdong River."
"Although Kim's early successes led him to predict he would end the war by the end of August, Chinese leaders were more pessimistic."
"To counter a possible US deployment, Zhou Enlai secured a Soviet commitment to have the Soviet Union support Chinese forces with air cover, and deployed 260,000 soldiers along the Korean border, under the command of Gao Gang."
"Zhou commanded Chai Chengwen to conduct a topographical survey of Korea, and directed Lei Yingfu, Zhou's military advisor in Korea, to analyze the military situation in Korea."
Lei concluded that MacArthur would most likely attempt a landing at Incheon.
"The United States Air Force (USAF) interrupted KPA logistics with 40 daily ground support sorties that destroyed 32 bridges, halting most daytime road and rail traffic."
KPA forces were forced to hide in tunnels by day and move only at night.
"To deny matériel to the KPA, the USAF destroyed logistics depots, petroleum refineries, and harbors, while the US Navy air forces attacked transport hubs."
"Consequently, the over-extended KPA could not be supplied throughout the south."
"Tank battalions deployed to Korea directly from the US mainland from the port of San Francisco to the port of Pusan, the largest Korean port."
"By late August, the Pusan Perimeter had some 500 medium tanks battle-ready."
"In early September 1950, UN forces outnumbered the KPA 180,000 to 100,000 soldiers."
"To relieve the Pusan Perimeter, General MacArthur recommended an amphibious landing at Incheon, near Seoul and well over 160 km (100 mi) behind the KPA lines."
"When authorized, he activated a combined US Army and Marine Corps, and ROK force."
"US X Corps, led by Major General Edward Almond, consisted of 40,000 men of the 1st Marine Division, the 7th Infantry Division and around 8,600 ROK soldiers."
"By 15 September, the amphibious assault force faced few KPA defenders at Incheon: military intelligence, psychological warfare, guerrilla reconnaissance, and protracted bombardment facilitated a relatively light battle."
"However, the bombardment destroyed most of the city of Incheon."
Chinese commanders were not briefed on North Korean troop numbers or operational plans.
"US air raids caused heavy damage to the KPA, destroying most of its tanks and much of its artillery."
"KPA troops in the south, instead of effectively withdrawing north, rapidly disintegrated, leaving Pyongyang vulnerable."
"During the general retreat only 25,000 to 30,000 KPA soldiers managed to reach the KPA lines."
"On 27 September, Stalin convened an emergency session of the Politburo, in which he condemned the incompetence of the KPA command and held Soviet military advisers responsible for the defeat."
On 29 September MacArthur restored the government of the Republic of Korea under Syngman Rhee.
"On 30 September, US Defense Secretary George Marshall sent an eyes-only message to MacArthur: ""We want you to feel unhampered tactically and strategically to proceed north of the 38th parallel."""
"During October, the South Korean police executed people who were suspected to be sympathetic to North Korea, and similar massacres were carried out until early 1951."
"On 30 September, Zhou Enlai warned the US that China was prepared to intervene in Korea if the US crossed the 38th Parallel."
"Zhou attempted to advise KPA commanders on how to conduct a general withdrawal by using the same tactics that allowed Chinese communist forces to successfully escape Chiang Kai-shek's Encirclement Campaigns in the 1930s, but by some accounts KPA commanders did not use these tactics effectively."
MacArthur made a statement demanding the KPA's unconditional surrender.
"Six days later, on 7 October, with UN authorization, the UN Command forces followed the ROK forces northwards."
"The X Corps landed at Wonsan (in southeastern North Korea) and Riwon (in northeastern North Korea) on 26 October, but these cities had already been captured by ROK forces."
The Eighth US Army drove up western Korea and captured Pyongyang on 19 October 1950.
The 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team made their first of two combat jumps during the Korean War on 20 October 1950 at Sunchon and Sukchon.
"The mission was to cut the road north going to China, preventing North Korean leaders from escaping from Pyongyang; and to rescue US prisoners of war."
"At month's end, UN forces held 135,000 KPA prisoners of war."
"As they neared the Sino-Korean border, the UN forces in the west were divided from those in the east by 50–100 miles (80–161 km) of mountainous terrain."
"In addition to the 135,000 captured, the KPA had also suffered some 200,000 men killed or wounded for a total of 335,000 casualties since the end of June 1950, and had lost 313 tanks (mostly T-34/85 models)."
"A mere 25,000 KPA regulars retreated across the 38th Parallel, as their military had entirely collapsed."
"Truman disagreed, and ordered caution at the Sino-Korean border."
"One week later, on 7 July, Zhou and Mao chaired a conference discussing military preparations for the Korean Conflict."
Another conference took place on 10 July.
"Here it was decided that the Thirteenth Army Corps under the Fourth Field Army of the PLA, one of the best trained and equipped units in China, would be immediately transformed into the Northeastern Border Defense Army (NEBDA) to prepare for ""an intervention in the Korean War if necessary""."
"The Chinese people cannot but be concerned about a solution of the Korean question""."
"Thus, through neutral-country diplomats, China warned that in safeguarding Chinese national security, they would intervene against the UN Command in Korea."
"President Truman interpreted the communication as ""a bald attempt to blackmail the UN"", and dismissed it."
Mao ordered that his troops should be ready for action by the end of August.
"At the same time, Stalin made it clear that Soviet forces themselves would not directly intervene."
"In a series of emergency meetings that lasted from 2 to 5 October, Chinese leaders debated whether to send Chinese troops into Korea."
"There was considerable resistance among many leaders, including senior military leaders, to confronting the US in Korea."
"Mao strongly supported intervention, and Zhou was one of the few Chinese leaders who firmly supported him."
"After Lin Biao politely refused Mao's offer to command Chinese forces in Korea (citing his upcoming medical treatment), Mao decided that Peng Dehuai would be the commander of the Chinese forces in Korea after Peng agreed to support Mao's position."
Mao then asked Peng to speak in favor of intervention to the rest of the Chinese leaders.
"After Peng made the case that if US troops conquered Korea and reached the Yalu they might cross it and invade China, the Politburo agreed to intervene in Korea."
"On 4 August 1950, with a planned invasion of Taiwan aborted due to the heavy US naval presence, Mao reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force."
"There they conferred with the top Soviet leadership, which included Joseph Stalin as well as Vyacheslav Molotov, Lavrentiy Beria and Georgy Malenkov."
"Stalin initially agreed to send military equipment and ammunition, but warned Zhou that the Soviet Air Force would need two or three months to prepare any operations."
"In a subsequent meeting, Stalin told Zhou that he would only provide China with equipment on a credit basis, and that the Soviet Air Force would only operate over Chinese airspace, and only after an undisclosed period of time."
Stalin did not agree to send either military equipment or air support until March 1951.
"Mao did not find Soviet air support especially useful, as the fighting was going to take place on the south side of the Yalu."
"UN aerial reconnaissance had difficulty sighting PVA units in daytime, because their march and bivouac discipline minimized aerial detection."
"The PVA marched ""dark-to-dark"" (19:00–03:00), and aerial camouflage (concealing soldiers, pack animals, and equipment) was deployed by 05:30."
"Meanwhile, daylight advance parties scouted for the next bivouac site."
"During daylight activity or marching, soldiers were to remain motionless if an aircraft appeared, until it flew away; PVA officers were under order to shoot security violators."
"Such battlefield discipline allowed a three-division army to march the 460 km (286 mi) from An-tung, Manchuria, to the combat zone in some 19 days."
This meeting was much publicized because of the General's discourteous refusal to meet the President on the continental United States.
"To President Truman, MacArthur speculated there was little risk of Chinese intervention in Korea, and that the PRC's opportunity for aiding the KPA had lapsed."
"He believed the PRC had some 300,000 soldiers in Manchuria, and some 100,000–125,000 soldiers at the Yalu River."
"He further concluded that, although half of those forces might cross south, ""if the Chinese tried to get down to Pyongyang, there would be the greatest slaughter"" without air force protection."
"After secretly crossing the Yalu River on 19 October, the PVA 13th Army Group launched the First Phase Offensive on 25 October, attacking the advancing UN forces near the Sino-Korean border."
This military decision made solely by China changed the attitude of the Soviet Union.
"Twelve days after PVA troops entered the war, Stalin allowed the Soviet Air Force to provide air cover, and supported more aid to China."
"After inflicting heavy losses on the ROK II Corps at the Battle of Onjong, the first confrontation between Chinese and US military occurred on 1 November 1950."
"Deep in North Korea, thousands of soldiers from the PVA 39th Army encircled and attacked the US 8th Cavalry Regiment with three-prong assaults—from the north, northwest, and west—and overran the defensive position flanks in the Battle of Unsan."
"The surprise assault resulted in the UN forces retreating back to the Ch'ongch'on River, while the PVA unexpectedly disappeared into mountain hideouts following victory."
It is unclear why the Chinese did not press the attack and follow up their victory.
"The UN Command, however, were unconvinced that the Chinese had openly intervened because of the sudden PVA withdrawal."
"On 24 November, the Home-by-Christmas Offensive was launched with the US Eighth Army advancing in northwest Korea, while US X Corps attacked along the Korean east coast."
"But the PVA were waiting in ambush with their Second Phase Offensive, which they executed at two sectors: in the East at the Chosin Reservoir and in the Western sector at Ch'ongch'on River."
"On 13 November, Mao appointed Zhou Enlai the overall commander and coordinator of the war effort, with Peng as field commander."
"On 25 November on the Korean western front, the PVA 13th Army Group attacked and overran the ROK II Corps at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River, and then inflicted heavy losses on the US 2nd Infantry Division on the UN forces' right flank."
Believing that they could not hold against the PVA the Eighth Army began to retreat from North Korea crossing the 38th Parallel in mid-December.
"UN morale hit rock bottom when Lieutenant General Walton Walker, commander of the US Eighth Army, was killed on 23 December 1950 in an automobile accident."
In the east on 27 November the PVA 9th Army Group initiated the Battle of Chosin Reservoir.
"Here the UN forces fared comparatively better: like the Eighth Army the surprise attack also forced X Corps to retreat from northeast Korea, but they were in the process able to breakout from the attempted encirclement by the PVA and execute a successful tactical withdrawal."
X Corps managed to establish a defensive perimeter at the port city of Hungnam on 11 December and were able to evacuate by 24 December in order to reinforce the badly depleted US Eighth Army to the south.
"During the evacuation, about 193 shiploads of UN forces and matériel (approximately 105,000 soldiers, 98,000 civilians, 17,500 vehicles, and 350,000 tons of supplies) were evacuated to Pusan."
"The SS Meredith Victory was noted for evacuating 14,000 refugees, the largest rescue operation by a single ship, even though it was designed to hold 12 passengers."
"Before escaping, the UN forces razed most of Hungnam city, with particular attention to the port facilities."
"On 16 December 1950, President Truman declared a national state of emergency with Presidential Proclamation No."
"Later, the Chinese claimed that US bombers had violated PRC national airspace on three separate occasions and attacked Chinese targets before China intervened."
"With Lieutenant General Matthew Ridgway assuming the command of the US Eighth Army on 26 December, the PVA and the KPA launched their Third Phase Offensive (also known as the ""Chinese New Year's Offensive"") on New Year's Eve of 1950/51."
"Utilizing night attacks in which UN fighting positions were encircled and then assaulted by numerically superior troops who had the element of surprise, the attacks were accompanied by loud trumpets and gongs, which fulfilled the double purpose of facilitating tactical communication and mentally disorienting the enemy."
"UN forces initially had no familiarity with this tactic, and as a result some soldiers panicked, abandoning their weapons and retreating to the south."
"The offensive overwhelmed UN forces, allowing the PVA and KPA to capture Seoul for the second time on 4 January 1951."
"Following this, the CPV party committee issued orders regarding tasks during rest and reorganization on 8 January 1951, outlining Chinese war goals."
"The orders read: ""the central issue is for the whole party and army to overcome difficulties … to improve tactics and skills."
"When the next campaign starts … we will annihilate all enemies and liberate all Korea."""
"In his telegram to Peng on 14 January, Mao stressed the importance of preparing for ""the last battle"" in the spring in order to ""fundamentally resolve the [Korean] issue""."
"These setbacks prompted General MacArthur to consider using nuclear weapons against the Chinese or North Korean interiors, with the intention that radioactive fallout zones would interrupt the Chinese supply chains."
"The PVA had outrun its logistics capability and thus were unable to press on beyond Seoul as food, ammunition, and matériel were carried nightly, on foot and bicycle, from the border at the Yalu River to the three battle lines."
"In late January, upon finding that the PVA had abandoned their battle lines, General Ridgway ordered a reconnaissance-in-force, which became Operation Thunderbolt (25 January 1951)."
"During the operation, the division and police conducted the Geochang massacre and Sancheong–Hamyang massacre."
"In mid-February, the PVA counterattacked with the Fourth Phase Offensive and achieved initial victory at Hoengseong."
But the offensive was soon blunted by US IX Corps at Chipyong-ni in the center.
The US 23rd Regimental Combat Team and the French Battalion fought a short but desperate battle that broke the attack's momentum.
"The battle is sometimes known as the ""Gettysburg of the Korean War"": 5,600 South Korean, US, and French troops were surrounded on all sides by 25,000 PVA."
"UN forces had previously retreated in the face of large PVA/KPA forces instead of getting cut off, but this time they stood and fought, and won."
"In the last two weeks of February 1951, Operation Thunderbolt was followed by Operation Killer, carried out by the revitalized Eighth Army."
"It was a full-scale, battlefront-length attack staged for maximum exploitation of firepower to kill as many KPA and PVA troops as possible."
"Operation Killer concluded with US I Corps re-occupying the territory south of the Han River, and IX Corps capturing Hoengseong."
"On 7 March 1951, the Eighth Army attacked with Operation Ripper, expelling the PVA and the KPA from Seoul on 14 March 1951."
"Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks."
PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war.
"In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing."
"What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but having no food, bullets, or trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded."
"Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving supply methods, but these efforts were never sufficient."
"At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) began participating in the war from September 1951 onward."
"The Fourth Phase Offensive had catastrophically failed, in contrast to the success of the Second Phase Offensive and limited gains of the Third Phase Offensive."
There were several reasons for the dismissal.
"MacArthur had crossed the 38th Parallel in the mistaken belief that the Chinese would not enter the war, leading to major allied losses."
"He believed that whether to use nuclear weapons should be his decision, not the President's."
MacArthur threatened to destroy China unless it surrendered.
"While MacArthur felt total victory was the only honorable outcome, Truman was more pessimistic about his chances once involved in a land war in Asia, and felt a truce and orderly withdrawal from Korea could be a valid solution."
"MacArthur was the subject of congressional hearings in May and June 1951, which determined that he had defied the orders of the President and thus had violated the US Constitution."
"A popular criticism of MacArthur was that he never spent a night in Korea, and directed the war from the safety of Tokyo."
"MacArthur was relieved primarily due to his determination to expand the war into China, which other officials believed would needlessly escalate a limited war and consume too many already overstretched resources."
"Despite MacArthur's claims that he was restricted to fighting a limited war when China was fighting all-out, congressional testimony revealed China was using restraint as much as the US was, as they were not using air power against front-line troops, communication lines, ports, naval air forces, or staging bases in Japan, which had been crucial to the survival of UN forces in Korea."
"Simply fighting on the peninsula had already tied down significant portions of US airpower; as Air Force chief of staff Hoyt Vandenberg said, 80–85% the tactical capacity, one-fourth of the strategic portion, and 20% of air defense forces of the USAF were engaged in a single country."
There was also fear that crossing into China would provoke the Soviet Union into entering the war.
Further attacks slowly depleted the PVA and KPA forces; Operations Courageous (23–28 March 1951) and Tomahawk (23 March 1951) (a combat jump by the 187th Airborne Regimental Combat Team) were a joint ground and airborne infiltration meant to trap PVA forces between Kaesong and Seoul.
"The first thrust of the offensive fell upon I Corps, which fiercely resisted in the Battle of the Imjin River (22–25 April 1951) and the Battle of Kapyong (22–25 April 1951), blunting the impetus of the offensive, which was halted at the No-name Line north of Seoul."
"Casualty ratios were grievously disproportionate; Peng had expected a 1–1 or 2-1 ratio, but instead, Chinese combat casualties from 22 to 29 April totaled between 40,000 and 60,000 compared to only 4,000 for the UN – a casualty ratio between 10–1 and 15–1."
"By the time Peng had called off the attack in the western sector on 29 April, the three participating armies had lost a third of their front line combat strength within a week."
"On 15 May 1951, the PVA commenced the second impulse of the Spring Offensive and attacked the ROK and US X Corps in the east at the Soyang River."
"370,000 PVA and 114,000 KPA troops had been mobilized for the second step of the Fifth Phase Offensive, with the bulk attacking in the eastern sector with about a quarter attempting to pin the US I Corps and IX Corps in the western sector."
"After initial success, they were halted by 20 May and repulsed over the following days, with western histories generally designating 22 May as the end of the offensive."
"At month's end, the Chinese planned the third step of the Fifth Phase Offensive (withdrawal), which they estimated would take 10 to 15 days to complete for their 340,000 remaining men, and set the retreat date for the night of 23 May."
"They were caught off guard when the US Eighth Army counterattacked and regained the Kansas Line on the morning of 12 May, 23 hours before the expected withdrawal."
"The surprise attack turned the retreat into ""the most severe loss since our forces had entered Korea""; from 16 May to 23 May, the PVA had suffered another 45,000 to 60,000 casualties before their remaining men managed to evacuate back north."
"During the counteroffensive, the US-led coalition captured land up to about six miles north of the 38th Parallel, with most forces stopping at the Kansas Line and a minority going further to the Wyoming Line."
"PVA and KPA forces suffered greatly during this offensive, especially in the Chuncheon sector and at Chiam-ni and Hwacheon; in the latter sector alone the PVA/KPA suffered over 73,207 casualties, including 8,749 captured, compared to 2,647 total casualties of the US IX Corps which engaged them."
The UN's Kansas Line halt and subsequent offensive action stand-down began the stalemate that lasted until the armistice of 1953.
"The disastrous failure of the Fifth Phase Offensive (which Peng later recalled as one of only four mistakes he made in his military career) ""led Chinese leaders to change their goal from driving the UNF out of Korea to merely defending China's security and ending the war through negotiations""."
"Large-scale bombing of North Korea continued, and protracted armistice negotiations began on 10 July 1951 at Kaesong, an ancient capital of North Korea located in PVA/KPA held territory."
"On the Chinese side, Zhou Enlai directed peace talks, and Li Kenong and Qiao Guanghua headed the negotiation team."
Combat continued while the belligerents negotiated; the goal of the UN forces was to recapture all of South Korea and to avoid losing territory.
"The PVA and the KPA attempted similar operations, and later effected military and psychological operations in order to test the UN Command's resolve to continue the war."
"The two sides constantly traded artillery fire along the front, the American-led forces possessing a large firepower advantage over the Chinese-led forces."
"The communist insurgency, reinvigorated by North Korean support and scattered bands of KPA stragglers, also resurged in the south."
In the autumn of 1951 Van Fleet ordered Major General Paik Sun-yup to break the back of guerrilla activity.
"From December 1951 to March 1952, ROK security forces claimed to have killed 11,090 partisans and sympathizers and captured 9,916 more."
"The principal battles of the stalemate include the Battle of Bloody Ridge (18 August–15 September 1951), the Battle of the Punchbowl (31 August-21 September 1951), the Battle of Heartbreak Ridge (13 September–15 October 1951), the Battle of Old Baldy (26 June–4 August 1952), the Battle of White Horse (6–15 October 1952), the Battle of Triangle Hill (14 October–25 November 1952), the Battle of Hill Eerie (21 March–21 June 1952), the sieges of Outpost Harry (10–18 June 1953), the Battle of the Hook (28–29 May 1953), the Battle of Pork Chop Hill (23 March–16 July 1953) and the Battle of Kumsong (13–27 July 1953)."
"PVA troops suffered from deficient military equipment, serious logistical problems, overextended communication and supply lines, and the constant threat of UN bombers."
All of these factors generally led to a rate of Chinese casualties that was far greater than the casualties suffered by UN troops.
"The situation became so serious that, in November 1951, Zhou Enlai called a conference in Shenyang to discuss the PVA's logistical problems."
"At the meeting it was decided to accelerate the construction of railways and airfields in the area, to increase the number of trucks available to the army, and to improve air defense by any means possible."
These commitments did little to directly address the problems confronting PVA troops.
In the months after the Shenyang conference Peng Dehuai went to Beijing several times to brief Mao and Zhou about the heavy casualties suffered by Chinese troops and the increasing difficulty of keeping the front lines supplied with basic necessities.
"Peng was convinced that the war would be protracted, and that neither side would be able to achieve victory in the near future."
"On 24 February 1952, the Military Commission, presided over by Zhou, discussed the PVA's logistical problems with members of various government agencies involved in the war effort."
The atmosphere became so tense that Zhou was forced to adjourn the conference.
"In both cases, the Chinese had some success in penetrating South Korean lines, but failed to capitalize, particularly when the US forces present responded with overwhelming firepower."
"Chinese casualties in their final major offensive of the war (above normal wastage for the front) were about 72,000, including 25,000 killed in action compared to 14,000 for the UN (the vast majority of these deaths were South Koreans, though 1,611 were Americans)."
June 1953 saw the highest monthly artillery expenditure of the war by both sides.
"A major, problematic negotiation point was prisoner of war (POW) repatriation."
"The PVA, KPA and UN Command could not agree on a system of repatriation because many PVA and KPA soldiers refused to be repatriated back to the north, which was unacceptable to the Chinese and North Koreans."
"With the United Nations' acceptance of India's proposed Korean War armistice, the KPA, the PVA and the UN Command signed the Korean Armistice Agreement on 27 July 1953."
South Korean president Syngman Rhee refused to sign the agreement.
"The war is considered to have ended at this point, even though there was no peace treaty."
"The DMZ runs northeast of the 38th Parallel; to the south, it travels west."
"Kaesong, site of the initial armistice negotiations, originally was in pre-war South Korea, but now is part of North Korea."
The DMZ has since been patrolled by the KPA and the ROK and US still operating as the UN Command.
"The Armistice also called upon the governments of South Korea, North Korea, China and the United States to participate in continued peace talks."
"After the war, Operation Glory was conducted from July to November 1954, to allow combatant countries to exchange their dead."
"The remains of 4,167 US Army and US Marine Corps dead were exchanged for 13,528 KPA and PVA dead, and 546 civilians dead in UN prisoner-of-war camps were delivered to the South Korean government."
"After Operation Glory, 416 Korean War unknown soldiers were buried in the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific (The Punchbowl), on the island of Oahu, Hawaii."
"Defense Prisoner of War/Missing Personnel Office (DPMO) records indicate that the PRC and North Korea transmitted 1,394 names, of which 858 were correct."
"From 4,167 containers of returned remains, forensic examination identified 4,219 individuals."
"Of these, 2,944 were identified as from the US, and all but 416 were identified by name."
"From 1996 to 2006, North Korea recovered 220 remains near the Sino-Korean border."
"Since 1953, the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission (NNSC), composed of members from the Swiss and Swedish Armed Forces, has been stationed near the DMZ."
"In April 1975, South Vietnam's capital was captured by the People's Army of Vietnam."
"Encouraged by the success of Communist revolution in Indochina, Kim Il-sung saw it as an opportunity to invade the South."
"Kim visited China in April of that year, and met with Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai to ask for military aid."
"Despite Pyongyang's expectations, however, Beijing refused to help North Korea for another war in Korea."
"Since the armistice, there have been numerous incursions and acts of aggression by North Korea."
"In 1976, the axe murder incident was widely publicized."
"Since 1974, four incursion tunnels leading to Seoul have been uncovered."
"In 2010, a North Korean submarine torpedoed and sank the South Korean corvette ROKS Cheonan, resulting in the deaths of 46 sailors."
"Speaking on 4 April 2013, the US Secretary of Defense, Chuck Hagel, informed the press that Pyongyang ""formally informed"" the Pentagon that it ""ratified"" the potential use of a nuclear weapon against South Korea, Japan and the United States of America, including Guam and Hawaii."
They committed themselves to the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.
"Although only rough estimates of civilian fatalities are available, scholars from Guenter Lewy to Bruce Cumings have noted that the percentage of civilian casualties in Korea was higher than in World War II or the Vietnam War, with Cumings putting civilian casualties at 2 million and Lewy estimating civilian deaths in the range of 2 million to 3 million."
"Cumings states that civilians represent ""at least"" half of the war's casualties, while Lewy suggests that the civilian portion of the death toll ""may have gone as high as 70 percent"", compared to Lewy's estimates of 42% in World War II and 30%–46% in the Vietnam War."
"Compounding this devastation for Korean civilians, virtually all of the major cities on the entire Korean Peninsula were destroyed as a result of the war."
"The May 1953 bombing of major North Korean dams threatened several million more North Koreans with starvation, although large-scale famine was averted with emergency aid provided by North Korea's allies."
American combat casualties were over 90 percent of non-Korean UN losses.
"The first four months of the Korean War, that is, the war prior to the Chinese intervention (which started near the end of October), were by far the bloodiest per day for the US forces as they engaged and destroyed the comparatively well-equipped KPA in intense fighting."
"American medical records show that from July to October 1950, the US Army sustained 31 percent of the combat deaths it would ultimately accumulate in the whole 37-month war."
"In 2010, the Chinese government would revise their official tally of war losses to 183,108 dead (114,084 in combat, 70,000 outside of combat) and 25,621 missing."
"Overall, 73 percent of Chinese infantry troops served in Korea (25 of 34 armies, or 79 of 109 infantry divisions, were rotated in)."
"More than 52 percent of the Chinese air force, 55 percent of the tank units, 67 percent of the artillery divisions, and 100 percent of the railroad engineering divisions were sent to Korea as well."
Chinese soldiers who served in Korea faced a greater chance of being killed than those who served in World War II or the Chinese Civil War.
"This was a relatively large cost, as China had only 1/25 the national income of the United States."
"Spending on the Korean War constituted 34–43 percent of China's annual government budget from 1950 to 1953, depending on the year."
"The PRIO Battle Deaths Dataset gave a similar figure for North Korean military deaths of 316,579."
"Chinese sources reported similar figures for the North Korean military of 290,000 ""casualties"" and 90,000 captured."
"Western sources estimate the PVA suffered about 400,000 killed and 486,000 wounded, while the KPA suffered 215,000 killed and 303,000 wounded."
"Cumings cites a much higher figure of 900,000 fatalities among Chinese soldiers."
"In South Korea, some 373,500 civilians were killed, more than 225,600 wounded, and over 387,740 were listed as missing."
"During the first communist occupation of Seoul alone, the KPA massacred 128,936 civilians and deported another 84,523 to North Korea."
"On the other side of the border, some 406,000 North Korean civilians were reported to have been killed, 1,594,000 were wounded, and 680,000 were missing."
"Army officials, desperate for weaponry, recovered Sherman tanks from World War II Pacific battlefields and reconditioned them for shipment to Korea."
Army Ordnance officials at Fort Knox pulled down M26 Pershing tanks from display pedestals around Fort Knox in order to equip the third company of the Army's hastily formed 70th Tank Battalion.
"Without adequate numbers of tactical fighter-bomber aircraft, the Air Force took F-51 (P-51) propeller-driven aircraft out of storage or from existing Air National Guard squadrons, and rushed them into front-line service."
A shortage of spare parts and qualified maintenance personnel resulted in improvised repairs and overhauls.
"Some Army combat units sent to Korea were supplied with worn out, 'red-lined' M1 rifles or carbines in immediate need of ordnance depot overhaul or repair."
A KPA tank corps equipped with about 120 T-34s spearheaded the invasion.
These drove against the ROK with few anti-tank weapons adequate to deal with the T-34s.
Additional Soviet armor was added as the offensive progressed.
"The KPA tanks had a good deal of early successes against ROK infantry, Task Force Smith and the US M24 Chaffee light tanks that they encountered."
Interdiction by ground attack aircraft was the only means of slowing the advancing KPA armor.
"As a result of this and the Pusan perimeter breakout the KPA had to retreat, and many of the T-34s and heavy weapons had to be abandoned."
"By the time the KPA withdrew from the South, a total of 239 T-34s and 74 SU-76 self-propelled guns were lost."
"The mountainous, forested terrain, especially in the eastern central zone, was poor tank country, limiting their mobility."
"Through the last two years of the war in Korea, UN tanks served largely as infantry support and mobile artillery pieces."
"A skirmish between North Korea and the UN Command occurred on 2 July 1950; the US Navy cruiser USS Juneau, the Royal Navy cruiser HMS Jamaica and the Royal Navy frigate HMS Black Swan fought four North Korean torpedo boats and two mortar gunboats, and sank them."
USS Juneau later sank several ammunition ships that had been present.
"The last sea battle of the Korean War occurred at Inchon, days before the Battle of Inchon; the ROK ship PC-703 sank a North Korean mine layer in the Battle of Haeju Island, near Inchon."
Three other supply ships were sunk by PC-703 two days later in the Yellow Sea.
"Thereafter, vessels from the UN nations held undisputed control of the sea about Korea."
"The gun ships were used in shore bombardment, while the aircraft carriers provided air support to the ground forces."
"During most of the war, the UN navies patrolled the west and east coasts of North Korea, sinking supply and ammunition ships and denying the North Koreans the ability to resupply from the sea."
"Aside from very occasional gunfire from North Korean shore batteries, the main threat to UN navy ships was from magnetic mines."
"During the war, five US Navy ships were lost to mines: two minesweepers, two minesweeper escorts, and one ocean tug."
"Mines and gunfire from North Korean coastal artillery damaged another 87 US warships, resulting in slight to moderate damage."
"Once-formidable fighters such as the P-51 Mustang, F4U Corsair, and Hawker Sea Fury—all piston-engined, propeller-driven, and designed during World War II—relinquished their air-superiority roles to a new generation of faster, jet-powered fighters arriving in the theater."
"For the initial months of the war, the P-80 Shooting Star, F9F Panther, Gloster Meteor and other jets under the UN flag dominated the Korean People's Air Force (KPAF) propeller-driven Soviet Yakovlev Yak-9 and Lavochkin La-9s."
"By early August 1950, the KPAF was reduced to only about 20 planes."
"The Chinese intervention in late October 1950 bolstered the KPAF with the MiG-15, one of the world's most advanced jet fighters."
The heavily armed MiGs were faster than first-generation UN jets and therefore could reach and destroy US B-29 Superfortress bomber flights despite their fighter escorts.
"With increasing B-29 losses, the USAF was forced to switch from a daylight bombing campaign to the safer but less accurate nighttime bombing of targets."
The MiG was designed as a bomber interceptor.
"It had a very high service ceiling—15,000 m (50,000 ft) and carried very heavy weaponry: one 37 mm cannon and two 23 mm cannons."
If coming in at higher altitude the advantage of engaging or not went to the MiG.
"Once in a level flight dogfight, both swept-wing designs attained comparable maximum speeds of around 1,100 km/h (660 mph)."
"Following Colonel Harrison Thyng's communication with the Pentagon, the 51st Fighter-Interceptor Wing finally reinforced the beleaguered 4th Wing in December 1951; for the next year-and-a-half stretch of the war, aerial warfare continued."
"Unlike the Vietnam War, in which the Soviet Union only officially sent ""advisers"", the 64th Fighter Aviation Corps saw action in the Korean air war."
"Fearful of confronting the US directly, the Soviet Union denied involvement of their personnel in anything other than an advisory role, but air combat quickly resulted in Soviet pilots dropping their code signals and speaking over the wireless in Russian."
"The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's PLAAF reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost."
"The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention."
"The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively."
"Despite being outnumbered (the number of Sabres in theater never exceeded 150 while MiG-15s reached 900 at their peak), North Korean and Chinese aircraft were seldom encountered south of Pyongyang."
"UN ground forces, supply lines, and infrastructure were not attacked from the air and although North Korea had 75 airfields capable of supporting MiGs, after 1951 any serious effort to operate from them was abandoned, keeping them based across the Yalu River in the safety of China."
"This confined most air-to-air engagements to MiG Alley, giving UN aircraft free rein to conduct strike missions over enemy territory with little fear of interception."
"In 1944–1945, during the Second World War, the YR-4 helicopter saw limited ambulance duty, but in Korea, where rough terrain trumped the jeep as a speedy medevac vehicle, helicopters like the Sikorsky H-19 helped reduce fatal casualties to a dramatic degree when combined with complementary medical innovations such as Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals."
"As such, the medical evacuation and care system for the wound was so effective for the UN forces that a wounded soldier who arrived at a MASH unit alive typically had a 97% chance of survival."
"The limitations of jet aircraft for close air support highlighted the helicopter's potential in the role, leading to development of the helicopter gunships used in the Vietnam War (1965–75)."
Major bombing began in late July.
"The policy was the result of debates after World War II, in which US policy rejected the mass civilian bombings that had been conducted in the later stages of World War II as unproductive and immoral."
"He proposed that MacArthur announce that the UN would employ the firebombing methods that ""brought Japan to its knees""."
"My instructions are very explicit; however, I want you to know that I have no compunction whatever to your bombing bona fide military objectives, with high explosives, in those five industrial centers."
"If you miss your target and kill people or destroy other parts of the city, I accept that as a part of war."
"""In September 1950, MacArthur said in his public report to the UN, ""The problem of avoiding the killing of innocent civilians and damages to the civilian economy is continually present and given my personal attention."
"""In October 1950, FEAF commander General Stratemeyer requested permission to attack the city of Sinuiju, a provincial capital with an estimated population of 60,000, ""over the widest area of the city, without warning, by burning and high explosive""."
"MacArthur's headquarters responded the following day: ""The general policy enunciated from Washington negates such an attack unless the military situation clearly requires it."
Under present circumstances this is not the case.
"""Following the intervention of the Chinese in November, General MacArthur ordered increased bombing on North Korea which included firebombing against the country's arsenals and communications centers and especially against the ""Korean end"" of all the bridges across the Yalu River."
"As with the aerial bombing campaigns over Germany and Japan in World War II, the nominal objective of the USAF was to destroy North Korea's war infrastructure and shatter the country's morale."
"As he had done previously in July and October, MacArthur denied the request, explaining that he planned to use the town's facilities after seizing it."
"However, at the same meeting, MacArthur agreed for the first time to a firebombing campaign, agreeing to Stratemeyer's request to burn the city of Kanggye and several other towns: ""Burn it if you so desire."
"Not only that, Strat, but burn and destroy as a lesson to any other of those towns that you consider of military value to the enemy."""
"The same evening, MacArthur's chief of staff told Stratemeyer that the firebombing of Sinuiju had also been approved."
"In his diary, Stratemeyer summarized the instructions as follows: ""Every installation, facility, and village in North Korea now becomes a military and tactical target."""
"North Korea ranks alongside Cambodia (500,000 tons), Laos (2 million tons) and South Vietnam (4 million tons) as among the most heavily bombed countries in history, with Laos suffering the most extensive bombardment relative to its size and population."
Almost every substantial building in North Korea was destroyed as a result.
"North Korean factories, schools, hospitals, and government offices were forced to move underground, and air defenses were ""non-existent""."
"In November 1950, the North Korean leadership instructed their population to build dugouts and mud huts and to dig tunnels, in order to solve the acute housing problem."
"US Air Force General Curtis LeMay commented: ""We went over there and fought the war and eventually burned down every town in North Korea anyway, some way or another, and some in South Korea, too."""
"Pyongyang, which saw 75 percent of its area destroyed, was so devastated that bombing was halted as there were no longer any worthy targets."
"On 28 November, Bomber Command reported on the campaign's progress: 95 percent of Manpojin was destroyed, along with 90 percent of Hoeryong, Namsi and Koindong, 85 percent of Chosan, 75 percent of both Sakchu and Huichon and 20 percent of Uiju."
"According to USAF damage assessments, ""Eighteen of twenty-two major cities in North Korea had been at least half obliterated."""
"UN air forces flew 1,040,708 combat and combat support sorties during the war."
"These claims have been disputed; Conrad Crane asserts that while the US worked towards developing chemical and biological weapons, the US military ""possessed neither the ability, nor the will"", to use them in combat."
Truman and Eisenhower both had military experience and viewed nuclear weapons as potentially usable components of their military.
"During Truman's first meeting to discuss the war on 25 June 1950, he ordered plans be prepared for attacking Soviet forces if they entered the war."
"By July, Truman approved another B-29 deployment to Britain, this time with bombs (but without their cores), to remind the Soviets of US offensive ability."
Deployment of a similar fleet to Guam was leaked to The New York Times.
The PRC's propaganda against the US was stepped up.
"The 'Aid Korea to resist America' campaign was made the slogan for increased production, greater national integration, and more rigid control over anti-national activities."
"One could not help feeling that Truman's threat came in useful to the leaders of the Revolution, to enable them to keep up the tempo of their activities."
"""After his statement caused concern in Europe, Truman met on 4 December 1950 with UK prime minister and Commonwealth spokesman Clement Attlee, French Premier René Pleven, and French Foreign Minister Robert Schuman to discuss their worries about atomic warfare and its likely continental expansion."
"The US' forgoing atomic warfare was not because of ""a disinclination by the Soviet Union and People's Republic of China to escalate [the Korean War]"", but because UN allies—notably from the UK, the Commonwealth, and France—were concerned about a geopolitical imbalance rendering NATO defenseless while the US fought China, who then might persuade the Soviet Union to conquer Western Europe."
"In the first scenario: If the PVA continued attacking in full and the UN Command was forbidden to blockade and bomb China, and without Taiwanese reinforcements, and without an increase in US forces until April 1951 (four National Guard divisions were due to arrive), then atomic bombs might be used in North Korea."
"In the second scenario: If the PVA continued full attacks and the UN Command blockaded China and had effective aerial reconnaissance and bombing of the Chinese interior, and the Taiwanese soldiers were maximally exploited, and tactical atomic bombing was to hand, then the UN forces could hold positions deep in North Korea."
"In the third scenario: if China agreed to not cross the 38th Parallel border, General MacArthur recommended UN acceptance of an armistice disallowing PVA and KPA troops south of the parallel, and requiring PVA and KPA guerrillas to withdraw northwards."
"The US Eighth Army would remain to protect the Seoul–Incheon area, while X Corps would retreat to Pusan."
"Because China deployed new armies to the Sino-Korean frontier, ground crews at the Kadena Air Base, Okinawa, assembled atomic bombs for Korean warfare, ""lacking only the essential pit nuclear cores""."
"In October 1951, the United States effected Operation Hudson Harbor to establish a nuclear weapons capability."
"USAF B-29 bombers practiced individual bombing runs from Okinawa to North Korea (using dummy nuclear or conventional bombs), coordinated from Yokota Air Base in east-central Japan."
"Hudson Harbor tested ""actual functioning of all activities which would be involved in an atomic strike, including weapons assembly and testing, leading, [and] ground control of bomb aiming""."
An envoy was sent to Hong Kong to deliver a warning to China.
"The message likely caused Chinese leaders to be more cautious about potential US use of nuclear weapons, but whether they learned about the B-29 deployment is unclear and the failure of the two major Chinese offensives that month likely was what caused them to shift to a defensive strategy in Korea."
"Tactically, given the dispersed nature of PVA/KPA forces, the relatively primitive infrastructure for staging and logistics centers, and the small number of bombs available (most would have been conserved for use against the Soviets), atomic attacks would have limited effects against the ability of China to mobilize and move forces."
"Strategically, attacking Chinese cities to destroy civilian industry and infrastructure would cause the immediate dispersion of the leadership away from such areas and give propaganda value for the communists to galvanize the support of Chinese civilians."
"The administration prepared contingency plans to use them against China, but like Truman, the new president feared that doing so would result in Soviet attacks on Japan."
"The war ended as it began, without US nuclear weapons deployed near battle."
"On 28 June, North Korean troops committed the Seoul National University Hospital massacre."
"On the same day, South Korean President Syngman Rhee ordered the Bodo League massacre, beginning mass killings of suspected leftist sympathizers and their families by South Korean officials and right-wing groups."
"Estimates of those killed during the Bodo League massacre range from at least 60,000–110,000 (Kim Dong-choon) to 200,000 (Park Myung-lim)."
It excavated some mass graves from the Bodo League massacres and confirmed the general outlines of those political executions.
"South Korean officials, after a parallel investigation, said they believed there were orders to shoot."
"71, 72 and 86 camps."
"Pro-Communist POWs experienced torture, cutting off of limbs, or were executed in public."
"The rebellion captured Francis Dodd, and was suppressed by the 187th Infantry Regiment."
"In the end, 14,235 Chinese POWs went to Taiwan and fewer than 6,000 POWs went back to mainland China."
"Those who went to Taiwan are called ""righteous men"" and experienced brainwashing again and were sent to the army or were arrested; while the survivors who went back to mainland China were welcomed as a ""hero"" first, but experienced anti-brainwashing, strict interrogation, and house arrest eventually, after the tattoos were discovered."
"After 1988, the Taiwanese government allowed POWs to go back to mainland China, and helped remove anti-communist tattoos; while the mainland Chinese government started to allow mainland Chinese prisoners of war to return from Taiwan."
About 43 percent of US POWs died during this period.
The Chinese defended their actions by stating that all Chinese soldiers during this period were suffering mass starvation and diseases due to logistical difficulties.
"The UN POWs said that most of the Chinese camps were located near the easily supplied Sino-Korean border, and that the Chinese withheld food to force the prisoners to accept the communism indoctrination programs."
"According to Chinese reports, over a thousand US POWs died by the end of June 1951, while a dozen British POWs died, and all Turkish POW survived."
"According to Hastings, wounded US POWs died for lack of medical attention and were fed a diet of corn and millet ""devoid of vegetables, almost barren of proteins, minerals, or vitamins"" with only 1/3 the calories of their usual diet."
"Especially in early 1951, thousands of prisoners lost the will to live and ""declined to eat the mess of sorghum and rice they were provided""."
"Over 88,000 South Korean soldiers were missing and the KPA claimed they captured 70,000 South Koreans."
"However, when ceasefire negotiations began in 1951, the KPA reported they held only 8,000 South Koreans."
They claimed their POW rosters were small because many POWs were killed in UN air raids and that they had released ROK soldiers at the front.
They insisted only volunteers were allowed to serve in the KPA.
"By early 1952, UN negotiators gave up trying to get back the missing South Koreans."
"However, since 1994, South Korean POWs have been escaping North Korea on their own after decades of captivity."
"As of 2010, the South Korean Ministry of Unification reported that 79 ROK POWs escaped the North."
"They report they were not told about the POW exchange procedures, and were assigned to work in mines in the remote northeastern regions near the Chinese and Russian border."
"In the winter of 1951, 50,000 to 90,000 South Korean National Defense Corps soldiers starved to death while marching southward under the PVA offensive when their commanding officers embezzled funds earmarked for their food."
This event is called the National Defense Corps Incident.
There is no evidence that Syngman Rhee was personally involved in or benefited from the corruption.
"By the end of the war, more than 113,000 USO volunteers from the US were working at home front and abroad."
Many stars came to Korea to give their performances.
"Throughout the Korean War, ""comfort stations"" were operated by South Korean officials for UN soldiers."
South Korea stagnated in the first postwar decade.
Park Chung-hee's May 16 coup enabled social stability.
"From 1965 to 1973, South Korea dispatched troops to South Vietnam and received $235,560,000 in allowance and military procurement from the United States."
GNP increased fivefold during the Vietnam War.
South Korea industrialized and modernized.
South Korea had one of the world's fastest-growing economies from the early 1960s to the late 1990s.
"After the armistice, Kim Il-Sung requested Soviet economic and industrial assistance."
"Eastern European members of the Soviet Bloc also contributed with ""logistical support, technical aid, [and] medical supplies""."
"China canceled North Korea's war debts, provided 800 million yuan, promised trade cooperation, and sent in thousands of troops to rebuild damaged infrastructure."
Contemporary North Korea remains underdeveloped.
"Estimates based on the most recent North Korean census suggest that 240,000 to 420,000 people died as a result of the 1990s North Korean famine and that there were 600,000 to 850,000 unnatural deaths in North Korea from 1993 to 2008."
"Because Korean traditional society places significant weight on paternal family ties, bloodlines, and purity of race, children of mixed race or those without fathers are not easily accepted in South Korean society."
International adoption of Korean children began in 1954.
"The US Immigration Act of 1952 legalized the naturalization of non-blacks and non-whites as US citizens, and made possible the entry of military spouses and children from South Korea after the Korean War."
"Mao supported intervention not to save North Korea, but because he believed that a military conflict with the US was inevitable after the US entered the war, and to appease the Soviet Union to secure military dispensation and achieve Mao's goal of making China a major world military power."
Mao was equally ambitious in improving his own prestige inside the communist international community by demonstrating that his Marxist concerns were international.
In his later years Mao believed that Stalin only gained a positive opinion of him after China's entrance into the Korean War.
"Inside mainland China, the war improved the long-term prestige of Mao, Zhou, and Peng, allowing the Chinese Communist Party to increase its legitimacy while weakening anti-Communist dissent."
"The Chinese government have encouraged the point of view that the war was initiated by the United States and South Korea, though ComIntern documents have shown that Mao sought approval from Joseph Stalin to enter the war."
"In Chinese media, the Chinese war effort is considered as an example of China's engaging the strongest power in the world with an under-equipped army, forcing it to retreat, and fighting it to a military stalemate."
"These successes were contrasted with China's historical humiliations by Japan and by Western powers over the previous hundred years, highlighting the abilities of the PLA and the Chinese Communist Party."
"The most significant negative long-term consequence of the war for China was that it led the United States to guarantee the safety of Chiang Kai-shek's regime in Taiwan, effectively ensuring that Taiwan would remain outside of PRC control through the present day."
Mao had also discovered the usefulness of large-scale mass movements in the war while implementing them among most of his ruling measures over PRC.
"Turkey, for example, entered NATO in 1952, and the foundation was laid for bilateral diplomatic and trade relations with South Korea."
"A library is a curated collection of sources of information and similar resources, selected by experts and made accessible to a defined community for reference or borrowing, often in a quiet environment conducive to study."
"It provides physical or digital access to material, and may be a physical location or a virtual space, or both."
"A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps, prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, table games, video games and other formats."
Libraries range widely in size up to millions of items.
"The first libraries consisted of archives of the earliest form of writing—the clay tablets in cuneiform script discovered in Sumer, some dating back to 2600 BC."
Private or personal libraries made up of written books appeared in classical Greece in the 5th century BC.
"In the 6th century, at the very close of the Classical period, the great libraries of the Mediterranean world remained those of Constantinople and Alexandria."
The libraries of Timbuktu were also established around this time and attracted scholars from all over the world.
"A library is organized for use and maintained by a public body, an institution, a corporation, or a private individual."
"Public and institutional collections and services may be intended for use by people who choose not to—or cannot afford to—purchase an extensive collection themselves, who need material no individual can reasonably be expected to have, or who require professional assistance with their research."
"In addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are experts at finding and organizing information and at interpreting information needs."
"Libraries often provide quiet areas for studying, and they also often offer common areas to facilitate group study and collaboration."
Libraries often provide public facilities for access to their electronic resources and the Internet.
Modern libraries are increasingly being redefined as places to get unrestricted access to information in many formats and from many sources.
"They are extending services beyond the physical walls of a building, by providing material accessible by electronic means, and by providing the assistance of librarians in navigating and analyzing very large amounts of information with a variety of digital resources."
Libraries are increasingly becoming community hubs where programs are delivered and people engage in lifelong learning.
"Topics of interest include accessibility of the collection, acquisition of materials, arrangement and finding tools, the book trade, the influence of the physical properties of the different writing materials, language distribution, role in education, rates of literacy, budgets, staffing, libraries for specially targeted audiences, architectural merit, patterns of usage, and the role of libraries in a nation's cultural heritage, and the role of government, church or private sponsorship."
"Since the 1960s, issues of computerization and digitization have arisen."
"Travelling libraries, such as the early horseback libraries of eastern Kentucky and bookmobiles, are generally of the lending type."
"Modern libraries are often a mixture of both, containing a general collection for circulation, and a reference collection which is restricted to the library premises."
"Also, increasingly, digital collections enable broader access to material that may not circulate in print, and enables libraries to expand their collections even without building a larger facility."
"Some academic libraries, especially those at public institutions, are accessible to members of the general public in whole or in part."
"Academic libraries are libraries that are hosted in post-secondary educational institutions, such as colleges and universities."
Their main function are to provide support in research and resource linkage for students and faculty of the educational institution.
"Academic libraries  house current, reliable relevant information resources spread through all the disciplines which serve to assuage the information requirements of students and faculty."
"Specific course-related resources are usually provided by the library, such as copies of textbooks and article readings held on 'reserve' (meaning that they are loaned out only on a short-term basis, usually a matter of hours)."
"Some academic libraries provide resources not usually associated with libraries, such as the ability to check out laptop computers, web cameras, or scientific calculators."
"Academic libraries offer workshops and courses outside of formal, graded coursework, which are meant to provide students with the tools necessary to succeed in their programs."
"These workshops may include help with citations, effective search techniques, journal databases, and electronic citation software."
"These workshops provide students with skills that can help them achieve success in their academic careers (and often, in their future occupations), which they may not learn inside the classroom."
"The academic library provides a quiet study space for students on campus; it may also provide group study space, such as meeting rooms."
"In North America, Europe, and other parts of the world, academic libraries are becoming increasingly digitally oriented."
"Some academic libraries take on new roles, for instance, acting as an electronic repository for institutional scholarly research and academic knowledge, such as the collection and curation of digital copies of students' theses and dissertations."
"Moreover, academic libraries are increasingly acting as publishers on their own on a not-for-profit basis, especially in the form of fully Open Access institutional publishers."
Some children's libraries have entire floors or wings dedicated to them in bigger libraries while smaller ones may have a separate room or area for children.
They are an educational agency seeking to acquaint the young with the world's literature and to cultivate a love for reading.
"Since animals are a calming influence and there is no judgment, children learn confidence and a love of reading."
Many states have these types of programs: parents need simply ask their librarian to see if it is available at their local library.
"Unlike a public library, a national library rarely allows citizens to borrow books."
"Often, their collections include numerous rare, valuable, or significant works."
"There are wider definitions of a national library, putting less emphasis on the repository character."
The first national libraries had their origins in the royal collections of the sovereign or some other supreme body of the state.
"Many national libraries cooperate within the National Libraries Section of the International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) to discuss their common tasks, define and promote common standards, and carry out projects helping them to fulfill their duties."
The national libraries of Europe participate in The European Library which is a service of the Conference of European National Librarians (CENL).
"If the library is part of a countywide library system, citizens with an active library card from around that county can use the library branches associated with the library system."
"A library can serve only their city, however, if they are not a member of the county public library system."
Much of the materials located within a public library are available for borrowing.
"The library staff decides upon the number of items patrons are allowed to borrow, as well as the details of borrowing time allotted."
"Typically, libraries issue library cards to community members wishing to borrow books."
Often visitors to a city are able to obtain a public library card.
"Many public libraries also serve as community organizations that provide free services and events to the public, such as reading groups and toddler story time."
"For many communities, the library is a source of connection to a vast world, obtainable knowledge and understanding, and entertainment."
"According to a study by the Pennsylvania Library Association, public library services play a major role in fighting rising illiteracy rates among youths."
Public libraries are protected and funded by the public they serve.
"As the number of books in libraries have steadily increased since their inception, the need for compact storage and access with adequate lighting has grown."
The stack system involves keeping a library's collection of books in a space separate from the reading room.
This arrangement arose in the 19th century.
"Book stacks quickly evolved into a fairly standard form in which the cast iron and steel frameworks supporting the bookshelves also supported the floors, which often were built of translucent blocks to permit the passage of light (but were not transparent, for reasons of modesty)."
The introduction of electrical lighting had a huge impact on how the library operated.
"The use of glass floors was largely discontinued, though floors were still often composed of metal grating to allow air to circulate in multi-story stacks."
"As more space was needed, a method of moving shelves on tracks (compact shelving) was introduced to cut down on otherwise wasted aisle space."
"Despite the importance of public libraries, they are routinely having their budgets cut by state legislature."
Funding has dwindled so badly that many public libraries have been forced to cut their hours and release employees.
"Typically, such libraries are used for research purposes, for example at a university."
Some items at reference libraries may be historical and even unique.
"Many lending libraries contain a ""reference section"", which holds books, such as dictionaries, which are common reference books, and are therefore not lent out."
"Such reference sections may be referred to as ""reading rooms"", which may also include newspapers and periodicals."
A research library supports scholarly or scientific research and will generally include primary as well as secondary sources; it will maintain permanent collections and attempt to provide access to all necessary materials.
"A research library is most often an academic or national library, but a large special library may have a research library within its special field, and a very few of the largest public libraries also serve as research libraries."
"A large university library may be considered a research library; and in North America, such libraries may belong to the Association of Research Libraries."
"Some extremely large or traditional research libraries are entirely reference in this sense, lending none of their materials; most academic research libraries, at least in the US and the UK, now lend books, but not periodicals or other materials."
Many research libraries are attached to a parental organization and serve only members of that organization.
"Examples of research libraries include the British Library, the Bodleian Library at Oxford University and the New York Public Library Main Branch on 42nd Street in Manhattan, State Public Scientific Technological Library of the Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy of Science."
"They are defined as an organization and not a service that provide access to digital works, have a preservation responsibility to provide future access to materials, and provides these items easily and affordably."
"The definition of a digital library implies that ""a digital library uses a variety of software, networking technologies and standards to facilitate access to digital content and data to a designated user community."""
"Access to digital libraries can be influenced by several factors, either individually or together."
"The most common factors that influence access are: The library's content, the characteristics and information needs of the target users, the library's digital interface, the goals and objectives of the library's organizational structure, and the standards and regulations that govern library use."
"Access will depend on the users ability to discover and retrieve documents that interest them and that they require, which in turn is a preservation question."
"With media failure, a particular digital item is unusable because of some sort of error or problem."
"A scratched CD-Rom, for example, will not display its contents correctly, but another, unscratched disk will not have that problem."
"Format obsolescence is when a digital format has been superseded by newer technology, and so items in the old format are unreadable and unusable."
"Dealing with media failure is a reactive process, because something is done only when a problem presents itself."
"Many private businesses and public organizations, including hospitals, churches, museums, research laboratories, law firms, and many government departments and agencies, maintain their own libraries for the use of their employees in doing specialized research related to their work."
"Depending on the particular institution, special libraries may or may not be accessible to the general public or elements thereof."
"In more specialized institutions such as law firms and research laboratories, librarians employed in special libraries are commonly specialists in the institution's field rather than generally trained librarians, and often are not required to have advanced degrees in a specifically library-related field due to the specialized content and clientele of the library."
"Special libraries can also include women's libraries or LGBTQ libraries, which serve the needs of women and the LGBTQ community."
"Libraries and the LGBTQ community have an extensive history, and there are currently many libraries, archives, and special collections devoted to preserving and helping the LGBTQ community."
"Women's libraries, such as the Vancouver Women's Library or the Women's Library @LSE are examples of women's libraries that offer services to women and girls and focus on women's history."
"Some special libraries, such as governmental law libraries, hospital libraries, and military base libraries commonly are open to public visitors to the institution in question."
"Depending on the particular library and the clientele it serves, special libraries may offer services similar to research, reference, public, academic, or children's libraries, often with restrictions such as only lending books to patients at a hospital or restricting the public from parts of a military collection."
"Given the highly individual nature of special libraries, visitors to a special library are often advised to check what services and restrictions apply at that particular library."
"Special libraries are distinguished from special collections, which are branches or parts of a library intended for rare books, manuscripts, and other special materials, though some special libraries have special collections of their own, typically related to the library's specialized subject area."
"For more information on specific types of special libraries, see law libraries, medical libraries, music libraries, or transportation libraries."
"Some libraries have additional galleries beyond the public ones, where reference materials are stored."
These reference stacks may be open to selected members of the public.
"Others require patrons to submit a ""stack request"", which is a request for an assistant to retrieve the material from the closed stacks: see List of closed stack libraries (in progress)."
Larger libraries are often divided into departments staffed by both paraprofessionals and professional librarians.
Circulation (or Access Services) – Handles user accounts and the loaning/returning and shelving of materials.
Collection Development – Orders materials and maintains materials budgets.
"Reference – Staffs a reference desk answering questions from users (using structured reference interviews), instructing users, and developing library programming."
"Reference may be further broken down by user groups or materials; common collections are children's literature, young adult literature, and genealogy materials."
Technical Services – Works behind the scenes cataloging and processing new materials and deaccessioning weeded materials.
Stacks Maintenance – Re-shelves materials that have been returned to the library after patron use and shelves materials that have been processed by Technical Services.
Stacks Maintenance also shelf reads the material in the stacks to ensure that it is in the correct library classification order.
"Basic tasks in library management include the planning of acquisitions (which materials the library should acquire, by purchase or otherwise), library classification of acquired materials, preservation of materials (especially rare and fragile archival materials such as manuscripts), the deaccessioning of materials, patron borrowing of materials, and developing and administering library computer systems."
"More long-term issues include the planning of the construction of new libraries or extensions to existing ones, and the development and implementation of outreach services and reading-enhancement services (such as adult literacy and children's programming)."
"This does not mean that library constructions should conform rigidly to a fixed standard of appearance and arrangement, but it does mean that the exterior should express as nearly as possible the purpose and functions of the interior."
This can be due to individuals' unease in approaching a staff member.
Ways in which a library's content is displayed or accessed may have the most impact on use.
"An antiquated or clumsy search system, or staff unwilling or untrained to engage their patrons, will limit a library's usefulness."
"In the public libraries of the United States, beginning in the 19th century, these problems drove the emergence of the library instruction movement, which advocated library user education."
One of the early leaders was John Cotton Dana.
"Before the computer age, this was accomplished by the card catalogue—a cabinet (or multiple cabinets) containing many drawers filled with index cards that identified books and other materials."
"In a large library, the card catalogue often filled a large room."
"The emergence of the Internet, however, has led to the adoption of electronic catalogue databases (often referred to as ""webcats"" or as online public access catalogues, OPACs), which allow users to search the library's holdings from any location with Internet access."
"This style of catalogue maintenance is compatible with new types of libraries, such as digital libraries and distributed libraries, as well as older libraries that have been retrofitted."
"Large libraries may be scattered within multiple buildings across a town, each having multiple floors, with multiple rooms housing their resources across a series of shelves called bays."
"Once a user has located a resource within the catalogue, they must then use navigational guidance to retrieve the resource physically, a process that may be assisted through signage, maps, GPS systems, or RFID tagging."
Finland has the highest number of registered book borrowers per capita in the world.
Over half of Finland's population are registered borrowers.
"In the US, public library users have borrowed on average roughly 15 books per user per year from 1856 to 1978."
"The growth of audiovisuals circulation, estimated at 25% of total circulation in 2004, accounts for about half of this decline."
The shift to digital libraries has greatly impacted the way people use physical libraries.
Libraries are trying to keep up with the digital world and the new generation of students that are used to having information just one click away.
"A 2003 report by the Open E-book Forum found that close to a million e-books had been sold in 2002, generating nearly $8 million in revenue."
"Another example of the shift to digital libraries can be seen in Cushing Academy's decision to dispense with its library of printed books—more than 20,000 volumes in all—and switch over entirely to digital media resources."
One claim to why there is a decrease in the usage of libraries stems from the observation of the research habits of undergraduate students enrolled in colleges and universities.
There have been claims that college undergraduates have become more used to retrieving information from the Internet than a traditional library.
"As each generation becomes more in tune with the Internet, their desire to retrieve information as quickly and easily as possible has increased."
Finding information by simply searching the Internet could be much easier and faster than reading an entire book.
"In a survey conducted by NetLibrary, 93% of undergraduate students claimed that finding information online makes more sense to them than going to the library."
"Also, 75% of students surveyed claimed that they did not have enough time to go to the library and that they liked the convenience of the Internet."
"The information that they are finding might be easy to retrieve and more readily available, but may not be as in depth as information from other resources such as the books available at a physical library."
"In the mid-2000s, Swedish company Distec invented a library book vending machine known as the GoLibrary, that offers library books to people where there is no branch, limited hours, or high traffic locations such as El Cerrito del Norte BART station in California."
Some specialised search engines such as Google Scholar offer a way to facilitate searching for academic resources such as journal articles and research papers.
The Online Computer Library Center allows anyone to search the world's largest repository of library records through its WorldCat online database.
"Websites such as LibraryThing and Amazon provide abstracts, reviews, and recommendations of books."
Libraries provide computers and Internet access to allow people to search for information online.
"Due to their holdings of valuable material, some libraries are important partners for search engines such as Google in realizing the potential of such projects and have received reciprocal benefits in cases where they have negotiated effectively."
"As the prominence of and reliance on the Internet has grown, library services have moved the emphasis from mainly providing print resources to providing more computers and more Internet access."
"Libraries face a number of challenges in adapting to new ways of information seeking that may stress convenience over quality, reducing the priority of information literacy skills."
"The potential decline in library usage, particularly reference services, puts the necessity for these services in doubt."
Library scholars have acknowledged that libraries need to address the ways that they market their services if they are to compete with the Internet and mitigate the risk of losing users.
This includes promoting the information literacy skills training considered vital across the library profession.
"However, marketing of services has to be adequately supported financially in order to be successful."
"National associations of the English-speaking world include the American Library Association, the Australian Library and Information Association, the Canadian Library Association, the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa, and the Research Libraries UK (a consortium of 30 university and other research libraries in the United Kingdom)."
"Library bodies such as CILIP (formerly the Library Association, founded 1877) may advocate the role that libraries and librarians can play in a modern Internet environment, and in the teaching of information literacy skills."
The Nigerian Library Association is the recognized group for librarians working in Nigeria.
Public library advocacy is support given to a public library for its financial and philosophical goals or needs.
"Most often this takes the form of monetary or material donations or campaigning to the institutions which oversee the library, sometimes by advocacy groups such as Friends of Libraries and community members."
"Originally, library advocacy was centered on the library itself, but current trends show libraries positioning themselves to demonstrate they provide ""economic value to the community"" in means that are not directly related to the checking out of books and other media."
Financing is often carried out by robbing valuable library items.
National and international coordination regarding military and civil structures for the protection of libraries is operated by Blue Shield International and UNESCO.
"Literature broadly is any collection of written work, but it is also used more narrowly for writings specifically considered to be an art form, especially prose fiction, drama, and poetry."
"In recent centuries, the definition has expanded to include oral literature, much of which has been transcribed."
"Literature is a method of recording, preserving, and transmitting knowledge and entertainment."
"Literature, as an art form, can also include works in various non-fiction genres, such as autobiography, diaries, memoir, letters, and the essay."
"In spite of this, the term has also been applied to spoken or sung texts."
"Developments in print technology have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, which now includes electronic literature."
"Literature is classified according to whether it is poetry, prose or drama, and such works are categorized according to historical periods, or their adherence to certain aesthetic features, or genre."
"In Western Europe, prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing."
"Then, during the Romantic period, a more restricted sense of the term emerged that emphasised the idea that ""literature"" was ""imaginative"" writing."
"Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions, so that cultural studies, for instance, include, in addition to canonical works, popular and minority genres."
"The word is also used in reference non-written works: to ""oral literature"" and ""the literature of preliterate culture""."
"A value judgment definition of literature considers it as consisting solely of high quality writing that forms part of the belles-lettres (""fine writing"") tradition."
"Rather, if the whole truth is told, oral tradition stands out as the single most dominant communicative technology of our species as both a historical fact and, in many areas still, a contemporary reality."
"In a study published in February 2020, new evidence showed that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted between 34,000 and 40,000 years ago."
"Significantly, this is a ""minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria"", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the oral histories of the Gunditjmara people, an Aboriginal Australian people of south-western Victoria, which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence."
"Homer's epic poetry, states Michael Gagarin, was largely composed, performed and transmitted orally."
"As folklores and legends were performed in front of distant audiences, the singers would substitute the names in the stories with local characters or rulers to give the stories a local flavor and thus connect with the audience, but making the historicity embedded in the oral tradition as unreliable."
"Oral storytelling traditions flourished in a context without the use of writing to record and preserve history, scientific knowledge, and social practices."
"While some stories were told for amusement and leisure, most functioned as practical lessons from tribal experience applied to immediate moral, social, psychological, and environmental issues."
"Stories fuse fictional, supernatural, or otherwise exaggerated characters and circumstances with real emotions and morals as a means of teaching."
Plots often reflect real life situations and may be aimed at particular people known by the story's audience.
"In this way, social pressure could be exerted without directly causing embarrassment or social exclusion."
"From Ancient Greece to the late 19th century, rhetoric played a central role in Western education in training orators, lawyers, counsellors, historians, statesmen, and poets."
"Though in both ancient Egypt and Mesoamerica, writing may have already emerged because of the need to record historical and environmental events."
"Subsequent innovations included more uniform, predictable, legal systems, sacred texts, and the origins of modern practices of scientific inquiry and knowledge-consolidation, all largely reliant on portable and easily reproducible forms of writing."
"The primary genres of the literature of ancient Egypt—didactic texts, hymns and prayers, and tales—were written almost entirely in verse; By the Old Kingdom (26th century BC to 22nd century BC), literary works included funerary texts, epistles and letters, hymns and poems, and commemorative autobiographical texts recounting the careers of prominent administrative officials."
"Drama and satire also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production."
"In ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, historiography, military science, agriculture, and poetry."
"China, the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing, produced the world's first print cultures."
Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty (769‒269 BC).
"Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records."
"Early genres included drama, fables, sutras and epic poetry."
"Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas, dating back to 1500–1000 BC, and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India."
The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts.
"The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BC saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana, with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD."
Other major literary works are Ramcharitmanas & Krishnacharitmanas.
"These documents contain prosaic records largely concerned with trade (lists, inventories, receipts, etc."
); no real literature has been discovered.
It is generally accepted that the poems were composed at some point around the late eighth or early seventh century BC.
Modern scholars consider these accounts legendary.
Most researchers believe that the poems were originally transmitted orally.
"From antiquity until the present day, the influence of Homeric epic on Western civilization has been great, inspiring many of its most famous works of literature, music, art and film."
"The Homeric epics were the greatest influence on ancient Greek culture and education; to Plato, Homer was simply the one who ""has taught Greece"" – ten Hellada pepaideuken."
"Classical Greek genres included philosophy, poetry, historiography, comedies and dramas."
"Although drama was popular in ancient Greece, of the hundreds of tragedies written and performed during the classical age, only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides."
"This consensus echoes a traditional Jewish view which gives Ezra, the leader of the Jewish community on its return from Babylon, a pivotal role in its promulgation."
"Literature in latin would flourish for the next six centuries, and includes essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings."
"Muslims believe it was transcribed in the Arabic dialect of the Quraysh, the tribe of Muhammad."
"Western Vernacular literature includes the Poetic Edda and the sagas, or heroic epics, of Iceland, the Anglo-Saxon Beowulf, and the German Song of Hildebrandt."
The Chinese inventor Bi Sheng made movable type of earthenware circa 1045.
This invention gradually made books less expensive to produce and more widely available.
"Early printed books, single sheets and images which were created before 1501 in Europe are known as incunables or incunabula."
"""Eventually, printing enabled other forms of publishing besides books."
"The history of modern newspaper publishing started in Germany in 1609, with publishing of magazines following in 1663."
"This further developed into the idea of the study of literature being ""the ideal carrier for the propagation of the humanist cultural myth of a welleducated, culturally harmonious nation""."
"There are very few women poets writing in English, whose names are remembered, until the twentieth century."
"Even in the nineteenth century the only names that stand out are Emily Bronte, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Emily Dickinson ( see American poetry)."
"But while generally women are absent from the European cannon of Romantic literature, there is one notable exception, the French novelist and memoirist Amantine Dupin (1804 – 1876) best known by her pen name George Sand One of the more popular writers in Europe in her lifetime, being more renowned than both Victor Hugo and Honoré de Balzac in England in the 1830s and 1840s, Sand is recognised as one of the most notable writers of the European Romantic era."
"Selma Lagerlöf (1858 – 1940)} as the first woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature, which she was awarded in 1909."
"The earliest of these books were educational books, books on conduct, and simple ABCs—often decorated with animals, plants, and anthropomorphic letters."
"– although many contemporary theorists and literary scholars believe, either that ""literature"" cannot be defined, or that it can refer to any use of language."
"The very best in literature is annually recognized by the Nobel Prize in Literature, which is awarded to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, produced ""in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction"" (original Swedish: den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning)."
Psychologists have also been using literature as a therapeutic tool.
"Psychologist Hogan argues for the value of the time and emotion that a person devotes to understanding a character's situation in literature; that it can unite a large community by provoking universal emotions, as well as allowing readers access to different cultures, and new emotional experiences."
The theory suggests that literature helps an individual's struggle for self-fulfilment.
"Prominent atheist figures such as the late Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins have praised the King James Version as being ""a giant step in the maturing of English literature"" and ""a great work of literature"", respectively, with Dawkins then adding, ""A native speaker of English who has never read a word of the King James Bible is verging on the barbarian""."
"This distinction is complicated by various hybrid forms such as the sound poetry, concrete poetry and prose poem, and more generally by the fact that prose possesses rhythm."
"Possibly as a result of Aristotle's influence (his Poetics), ""poetry"" before the 19th century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art."
"As a form it may pre-date literacy, with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature."
"Eliot suggested that while: ""the distinction between verse and prose is clear, the distinction between poetry and prose is obscure""."
"There are verse novels, a type of narrative poetry in which a novel-length narrative is told through the medium of poetry rather than prose."
Especially important was the great Roman orator Cicero.
"It was the lingua franca among literate Europeans until quite recent times, and the great works of Descartes (1596 – 1650[), Francis Bacon (1561 – 1626), and Baruch Spinoza (1632 – 1677[) were published in Latin."
"In English, the term emerged from the Romance languages in the late 15th century, with the meaning of ""news""; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction."
The romance is a closely related long prose narrative.
"Walter Scott defined it as ""a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents"", whereas in the novel ""the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society""."
"Initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically."
"Publishers and literary award societies typically consider a novella to be between 17,000 and 40,000 words."
The form is combined with music and dance in opera and musical theatre (see libretto).
A play is a written dramatic work by a playwright that is intended for performance in a theatre; it comprises chiefly dialogue between characters.
"A closet drama, by contrast, is written to be read rather than to be performed; the meaning of which can be realized fully on the page."
Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.
The earliest form of which there exists substantial knowledge is Greek drama.
"The creative work may be in a literary, artistic, educational, or musical form."
"Copyright is intended to protect the original expression of an idea in the form of a creative work, but not the idea itself."
"Literary works are defined by copyright law to mean ""any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung, and accordingly includes (a) a table or compilation (other than a database), (b) a computer program, (c) preparatory design material for a computer program, and (d) a database."""
Literary works are all works of literature; that is all works expressed in print or writing (other than dramatic or musical works).
It was established as federal law with the Copyright Act of 1790.
"This act was updated many times, including a major revision in 1976."
"Copyright law is largely harmonized in the Union, although country to country differences exist."
"The body of law was implemented in the EU through a number of directives, which the member states need to enact into their national law."
"The main copyright directives are the Copyright Term Directive, the Information Society Directive and the Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market."
Copyright in the Union is furthermore dependent on international conventions to which the European Union is a member (such as the TRIPS Agreement and conventions to which all Member States are parties (such as the Berne Convention)).
The convention protected copyrighted works for 50 years after the author's death (or 50 years after publication for unknown authors and corporations).
"However, in 2004 Japan extended the copyright term to 70 years for cinematographic works."
"At the end of 2018, as a result of the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, the 70 year term was applied to all works."
This new term is not applied retroactively; works that had entered the public domain between 1999 and 2018 by expiration would remain in the public domain.
It was banned in the United States from 1921 until 1933 on the grounds of obscenity.
"Nowadays it is a central literary text in English literature courses, throughout the world."
"It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC, and after his death, it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire."
"Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with western parts of Mesopotamia coming under ephemeral Roman control."
"In AD 226, the eastern regions of Mesopotamia fell to the Sassanid Persians."
The division of Mesopotamia between Roman (Byzantine from AD 395) and Sassanid Empires lasted until the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia of the Sasanian Empire and Muslim conquest of the Levant from Byzantines.
"A number of primarily neo-Assyrian and Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Osroene, and Hatra."
"Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BC."
"It has been identified as having ""inspired some of the most important developments in human history, including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops, and the development of cursive script, mathematics, astronomy, and agriculture""."
"An even earlier Greek usage of the name Mesopotamia is evident from The Anabasis of Alexander, which was written in the late 2nd century AD, but specifically refers to sources from the time of Alexander the Great."
"In the Anabasis, Mesopotamia was used to designate the land east of the Euphrates in north Syria."
"Later, the term Mesopotamia was more generally applied to all the lands between the Euphrates and the Tigris, thereby incorporating not only parts of Syria but also almost all of Iraq and southeastern Turkey."
"Upper Mesopotamia, also known as the Jazira, is the area between the Euphrates and the Tigris from their sources down to Baghdad."
"It is usually used to designate the area until the Muslim conquests, with names like Syria, Jazira, and Iraq being used to describe the region after that date."
It has been argued that these later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments.
"Both rivers are fed by numerous tributaries, and the entire river system drains a vast mountainous region."
Overland routes in Mesopotamia usually follow the Euphrates because the banks of the Tigris are frequently steep and difficult.
"The climate of the region is semi-arid with a vast desert expanse in the north which gives way to a 15,000-square-kilometre (5,800 sq mi) region of marshes, lagoons, mudflats, and reed banks in the south."
"In the extreme south, the Euphrates and the Tigris unite and empty into the Persian Gulf."
The arid environment ranges from the northern areas of rain-fed agriculture to the south where irrigation of agriculture is essential if a surplus energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) is to be obtained.
"This irrigation is aided by a high water table and by melting snows from the high peaks of the northern Zagros Mountains and from the Armenian Highlands, the source of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers that give the region its name."
"The usefulness of irrigation depends upon the ability to mobilize sufficient labor for the construction and maintenance of canals, and this, from the earliest period, has assisted the development of urban settlements and centralized systems of political authority."
"Agriculture throughout the region has been supplemented by nomadic pastoralism, where tent-dwelling nomads herded sheep and goats (and later camels) from the river pastures in the dry summer months, out into seasonal grazing lands on the desert fringe in the wet winter season."
"The area is generally lacking in building stone, precious metals, and timber, and so historically has relied upon long-distance trade of agricultural products to secure these items from outlying areas."
"In the marshlands to the south of the area, a complex water-borne fishing culture has existed since prehistoric times and has added to the cultural mix."
Periodic breakdowns in the cultural system have occurred for a number of reasons.
"The demands for labor has from time to time led to population increases that push the limits of the ecological carrying capacity, and should a period of climatic instability ensue, collapsing central government and declining populations can occur."
"Alternatively, military vulnerability to invasion from marginal hill tribes or nomadic pastoralists has led to periods of trade collapse and neglect of irrigation systems."
"Equally, centripetal tendencies amongst city-states have meant that central authority over the whole region, when imposed, has tended to be ephemeral, and localism has fragmented power into tribal or smaller regional units."
These trends have continued to the present day in Iraq.
"This entire history ends with either the arrival of the Achaemenid Empire in the late 6th century BC or with the Muslim conquest and the establishment of the Caliphate in the late 7th century AD, from which point the region came to be known as Iraq."
"In the long span of this period, Mesopotamia housed some of the world's most ancient highly developed, and socially complex states."
"The region was one of the four riverine civilizations where writing was invented, along with the Nile valley in Ancient Egypt, the Indus Valley Civilization in the Indian subcontinent, and the Yellow River in Ancient China."
"Mesopotamia housed historically important cities such as Uruk, Nippur, Nineveh, Assur and Babylon, as well as major territorial states such as the city of Eridu, the Akkadian kingdoms, the Third Dynasty of Ur, and the various Assyrian empires."
"Some of the important historical Mesopotamian leaders were Ur-Nammu (king of Ur), Sargon of Akkad (who established the Akkadian Empire), Hammurabi (who established the Old Babylonian state), Ashur-uballit II and Tiglath-Pileser I (who established the Assyrian Empire)."
"Scientists analysed DNA from the 8,000-year-old remains of early farmers found at an ancient graveyard in Germany."
They compared the genetic signatures to those of modern populations and found similarities with the DNA of people living in today's Turkey and Iraq.
"Along with Sumerian, Semitic languages were also spoken in early Mesopotamia."
"Subartuan a language of the Zagros, perhaps related to the Hurro-Urartuan language family is attested in personal names, rivers and mountains and in various crafts."
"Akkadian came to be the dominant language during the Akkadian Empire and the Assyrian empires, but Sumerian was retained for administrative, religious, literary and scientific purposes."
Different varieties of Akkadian were used until the end of the Neo-Babylonian period.
"Old Aramaic, which had already become common in Mesopotamia, then became the official provincial administration language of first the Neo-Assyrian Empire, and then the Achaemenid Empire: the official lect is called Imperial Aramaic."
"Akkadian fell into disuse, but both it and Sumerian were still used in temples for some centuries."
The last Akkadian texts date from the late 1st century AD.
Early in Mesopotamia's history (around the mid-4th millennium BC) cuneiform was invented for the Sumerian language.
"Cuneiform literally means ""wedge-shaped"", due to the triangular tip of the stylus used for impressing signs on wet clay."
The standardized form of each cuneiform sign appears to have been developed from pictograms.
"The earliest texts (7 archaic tablets) come from the É, a temple dedicated to the goddess Inanna at Uruk, from a building labeled as Temple C by its excavators."
The early logographic system of cuneiform script took many years to master.
"Thus, only a limited number of individuals were hired as scribes to be trained in its use."
It was not until the widespread use of a syllabic script was adopted under Sargon's rule that significant portions of the Mesopotamian population became literate.
"Massive archives of texts were recovered from the archaeological contexts of Old Babylonian scribal schools, through which literacy was disseminated."
"During the third millennium BC, there developed a very intimate cultural symbiosis between the Sumerian and the Akkadian language users, which included widespread bilingualism."
"The influence of Sumerian on Akkadian (and vice versa) is evident in all areas, from lexical borrowing on a massive scale, to syntactic, morphological, and phonological convergence."
This has prompted scholars to refer to Sumerian and Akkadian in the third millennium as a sprachbund.
"Akkadian gradually replaced Sumerian as the spoken language of Mesopotamia somewhere around the turn of the 3rd and the 2nd millennium BC (the exact dating being a matter of debate), but Sumerian continued to be used as a sacred, ceremonial, literary, and scientific language in Mesopotamia until the 1st century AD."
"An old Sumerian proverb averred that ""he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with the dawn."""
"Women as well as men learned to read and write, and for the Semitic Babylonians, this involved knowledge of the extinct Sumerian language, and a complicated and extensive syllabary."
"A considerable amount of Babylonian literature was translated from Sumerian originals, and the language of religion and law long continued to be the old agglutinative language of Sumer."
"Vocabularies, grammars, and interlinear translations were compiled for the use of students, as well as commentaries on the older texts and explanations of obscure words and phrases."
"The characters of the syllabary were all arranged and named, and elaborate lists were drawn up."
Many Babylonian literary works are still studied today.
"One of the most famous of these was the Epic of Gilgamesh, in twelve books, translated from the original Sumerian by a certain Sîn-lēqi-unninni, and arranged upon an astronomical principle."
Each division contains the story of a single adventure in the career of Gilgamesh.
"The whole story is a composite product, although it is probable that some of the stories are artificially attached to the central figure."
"This is the source of the 60-minute hour, the 24-hour day, and the 360-degree circle."
"The Sumerian calendar was lunisolar, with three seven-day weeks of a lunar month."
This form of mathematics was instrumental in early map-making.
The Babylonians also had theorems on how to measure the area of several shapes and solids.
"They measured the circumference of a circle as three times the diameter and the area as one-twelfth the square of the circumference, which would be correct if π were fixed at 3."
"The volume of a cylinder was taken as the product of the area of the base and the height; however, the volume of the frustum of a cone or a square pyramid was incorrectly taken as the product of the height and half the sum of the bases."
"The Babylonians are also known for the Babylonian mile, which was a measure of distance equal to about seven modern miles (11 km)."
"This measurement for distances eventually was converted to a time-mile used for measuring the travel of the Sun, therefore, representing time."
"This continued to Assyrian times, when Limmu lists were created as a year by year association of events with planetary positions, which, when they have survived to the present day, allow accurate associations of relative with absolute dating for establishing the history of Mesopotamia."
The Babylonian astronomers were very adept at mathematics and could predict eclipses and solstices.
Scholars thought that everything had some purpose in astronomy.
Most of these related to religion and omens.
Mesopotamian astronomers worked out a 12-month calendar based on the cycles of the moon.
They divided the year into two seasons: summer and winter.
The origins of astronomy as well as astrology date from this time.
"During the 8th and 7th centuries BC, Babylonian astronomers developed a new approach to astronomy."
They began studying philosophy dealing with the ideal nature of the early universe and began employing an internal logic within their predictive planetary systems.
This was an important contribution to astronomy and the philosophy of science and some scholars have thus referred to this new approach as the first scientific revolution.
This new approach to astronomy was adopted and further developed in Greek and Hellenistic astronomy.
"In Seleucid and Parthian times, the astronomical reports were thoroughly scientific; how much earlier their advanced knowledge and methods were developed is uncertain."
The Babylonian development of methods for predicting the motions of the planets is considered to be a major episode in the history of astronomy.
Seleucus is known from the writings of Plutarch.
He supported Aristarchus of Samos' heliocentric theory where the Earth rotated around its own axis which in turn revolved around the Sun.
"According to Plutarch, Seleucus even proved the heliocentric system, but it is not known what arguments he used (except that he correctly theorized on tides as a result of Moon's attraction)."
"Babylonian astronomy served as the basis for much of Greek, classical Indian, Sassanian, Byzantine, Syrian, medieval Islamic, Central Asian, and Western European astronomy."
"In addition, the Diagnostic Handbook introduced the methods of therapy and aetiology and the use of empiricism, logic, and rationality in diagnosis, prognosis and therapy."
"If a patient could not be cured physically, the Babylonian physicians often relied on exorcism to cleanse the patient from any curses."
These include the symptoms for many varieties of epilepsy and related ailments along with their diagnosis and prognosis.
They were also one of the first Bronze Age societies in the world.
"They developed from copper, bronze, and gold on to iron."
Palaces were decorated with hundreds of kilograms of these very expensive metals.
"Also, copper, bronze, and iron were used for armor as well as for different weapons such as swords, daggers, spears, and maces."
"According to a recent hypothesis, the Archimedes' screw may have been used by Sennacherib, King of Assyria, for the water systems at the Hanging Gardens of Babylon and Nineveh in the 7th century BC, although mainstream scholarship holds it to be a Greek invention of later times."
"Later, during the Parthian or Sasanian periods, the Baghdad Battery, which may have been the world's first battery, was created in Mesopotamia."
"Mesopotamians believed that the world was a flat disc, surrounded by a huge, holed space, and above that, heaven."
"They also believed that water was everywhere, the top, bottom and sides, and that the universe was born from this enormous sea."
"In addition, Mesopotamian religion was polytheistic."
"Although the beliefs described above were held in common among Mesopotamians, there were also regional variations."
"The Sumerian word for universe is an-ki, which refers to the god An and the goddess Ki."
"Their son was Enlil, the air god."
They believed that Enlil was the most powerful god.
He was the chief god of the pantheon.
"The Sumerians also posed philosophical questions, such as: Who are we?, Where are we?, How did we get here?."
They attributed answers to these questions to explanations provided by their gods.
"Babylonian thought was axiomatic and is comparable to the ""ordinary logic"" described by John Maynard Keynes."
Logic was employed to some extent in Babylonian astronomy and medicine.
Babylonian thought had a considerable influence on early Ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophy.
"In particular, the Babylonian text Dialogue of Pessimism contains similarities to the agonistic thought of the Sophists, the Heraclitean doctrine of dialectic, and the dialogs of Plato, as well as a precursor to the Socratic method."
The Ionian philosopher Thales was influenced by Babylonian cosmological ideas.
"Although music and songs amused kings, they were also enjoyed by ordinary people who liked to sing and dance in their homes or in the marketplaces."
Songs were sung to children who passed them on to their children.
Thus songs were passed on through many generations as an oral tradition until writing was more universal.
These songs provided a means of passing on through the centuries highly important information about historical events.
The oldest pictorial record of the Oud dates back to the Uruk period in Southern Mesopotamia over 5000 years ago.
"The image depicts a female crouching with her instruments upon a boat, playing right-handed."
This instrument appears hundreds of times throughout Mesopotamian history and again in ancient Egypt from the 18th dynasty onwards in long- and short-neck varieties.
The oud is regarded as a precursor to the European lute.
"Boxing and wrestling feature frequently in art, and some form of polo was probably popular, with men sitting on the shoulders of other men rather than on horses."
"They also played majore, a game similar to the sport rugby, but played with a ball made of wood."
"They also played a board game similar to senet and backgammon, now known as the ""Royal Game of Ur""."
"For example, during the earliest Sumerian period, the ""en"", or high priest of male gods was originally a woman, that of female goddesses, a man."
"Thorkild Jacobsen, as well as many others, has suggested that early Mesopotamian society was ruled by a ""council of elders"" in which men and women were equally represented, but that over time, as the status of women fell, that of men increased."
"As for schooling, only royal offspring and sons of the rich and professionals, such as scribes, physicians, temple administrators, went to school."
Most boys were taught their father's trade or were apprenticed out to learn a trade.
"Girls had to stay home with their mothers to learn housekeeping and cooking, and to look after the younger children."
Some children would help with crushing grain or cleaning birds.
"Unusually for that time in history, women in Mesopotamia had rights."
"They could own property and, if they had good reason, get a divorce."
"In the city of Ur, most people were buried in family graves under their houses, along with some possessions."
A few have been found wrapped in mats and carpets.
"Deceased children were put in big ""jars"" which were placed in the family chapel."
Other remains have been found buried in common city graveyards.
17 graves have been found with very precious objects in them.
It is assumed that these were royal graves.
"Rich of various periods, have been discovered to have sought burial in Bahrein, identified with Sumerian Dilmun."
"Sumerian temples functioned as banks and developed the first large-scale system of loans and credit, but the Babylonians developed the earliest system of commercial banking."
The word Ensi was used to describe the official who organized the work of all facets of temple agriculture.
"The need for irrigation led the Sumerians, and later the Akkadians, to build their cities along the Tigris and Euphrates and the branches of these rivers."
"Major cities, such as Ur and Uruk, took root on tributaries of the Euphrates, while others, notably Lagash, were built on branches of the Tigris."
"The rivers provided the further benefits of fish (used both for food and fertilizer), reeds, and clay (for building materials)."
"Although land nearer to the rivers was fertile and good for crops, portions of land farther from the water were dry and largely uninhabitable."
This is why the development of irrigation was very important for settlers of Mesopotamia.
Other Mesopotamian innovations include the control of water by dams and the use of aqueducts.
"Early settlers of fertile land in Mesopotamia used wooden plows to soften the soil before planting crops such as barley, onions, grapes, turnips, and apples."
Mesopotamian settlers were some of the first people to make beer and wine.
"Although the rivers sustained life, they also destroyed it by frequent floods that ravaged entire cities."
The unpredictable Mesopotamian weather was often hard on farmers; crops were often ruined so backup sources of food such as cows and lambs were also kept.
"Over time the southernmost parts of Sumerian Mesopotamia suffered from increased salinity of the soils, leading to a slow urban decline and a centring of power in Akkad, further north."
"Among the rivers and streams, the Sumerian people built the first cities along with irrigation canals which were separated by vast stretches of open desert or swamp where nomadic tribes roamed."
"Communication among the isolated cities was difficult and, at times, dangerous."
"Thus, each Sumerian city became a city-state, independent of the others and protective of its independence."
"At times one city would try to conquer and unify the region, but such efforts were resisted and failed for centuries."
"As a result, the political history of Sumer is one of almost constant warfare."
"Eventually Sumer was unified by Eannatum, but the unification was tenuous and failed to last as the Akkadians conquered Sumeria in 2331 BC only a generation later."
The Akkadian Empire was the first successful empire to last beyond a generation and see the peaceful succession of kings.
"The empire was relatively short-lived, as the Babylonians conquered them within only a few generations."
Most kings named themselves “king of the universe” or “great king”.
"Another common name was “shepherd”, as kings had to look after their people."
"Each of these were named after their main cities, like Nineveh, Samaria, Damascus, and Arpad."
They all had their own governor who had to make sure everyone paid their taxes.
Governors also had to call up soldiers to war and supply workers when a temple was built.
He was also responsible for enforcing the laws.
"In this way, it was easier to keep control of a large empire."
"Although Babylon was quite a small state in the Sumerian, it grew tremendously throughout the time of Hammurabi's rule."
"He was known as ""the lawmaker"", and soon Babylon became one of the main cities in Mesopotamia."
"It was later called Babylonia, which meant ""the gateway of the gods."""
It also became one of history's greatest centers of learning.
An early king Lugalbanda was supposed to have built the white walls around the city.
"As city-states began to grow, their spheres of influence overlapped, creating arguments between other city-states, especially over land and canals."
These arguments were recorded in tablets several hundreds of years before any major war—the first recording of a war occurred around 3200 BC but was not common until about 2500 BC.
"The later Stele of the Vultures at the end of the Early Dynastic III period  (2600–2350 BC), commemorating the victory of Eannatum of Lagash over the neighbouring rival city of Umma is the oldest monument in the world that celebrates a massacre."
"From this point forwards, warfare was incorporated into the Mesopotamian political system."
At times a neutral city may act as an arbitrator for the two rival cities.
"This helped to form unions between cities, leading to regional states."
"When empires were created, they went to war more with foreign countries."
"King Sargon, for example, conquered all the cities of Sumer, some cities in Mari, and then went to war with northern Syria."
Many Assyrian and Babylonian palace walls were decorated with the pictures of the successful fights and the enemy either desperately escaping or hiding amongst reeds.
The codes of Urukagina and Lipit Ishtar have been found.
He codified over 200 laws for Mesopotamia.
"The main emphasis was on various, very durable, forms of sculpture in stone and clay; little painting has survived, but what has suggests that painting was mainly used for geometrical and plant-based decorative schemes, though most sculpture was also painted."
"The Protoliterate period, dominated by Uruk, saw the production of sophisticated works like the Warka Vase and cylinder seals."
"The Guennol Lioness is an outstanding small limestone figure from Elam of about 3000–2800 BC, part man and part lion."
"A little later there are a number of figures of large-eyed priests and worshippers, mostly in alabaster and up to a foot high, who attended temple cult images of the deity, but very few of these have survived."
"Sculptures from the Sumerian and Akkadian period generally had large, staring eyes, and long beards on the men."
"It comes from the 18th or 19th centuries BC, and may also be moulded."
"The Assyrians developed a style of extremely large schemes of very finely detailed narrative low reliefs in stone for palaces, with scenes of war or hunting; the British Museum has an outstanding collection."
"They produced very little sculpture in the round, except for colossal guardian figures, often the human-headed lamassu, which are sculpted in high relief on two sides of a rectangular block, with the heads effectively in the round (and also five legs, so that both views seem complete)."
Even before dominating the region they had continued the cylinder seal tradition with designs which are often exceptionally energetic and refined.
"Scholarly literature usually concentrates on temples, palaces, city walls and gates, and other monumental buildings, but occasionally one finds works on residential architecture as well."
Archaeological surface surveys also allowed for the study of urban form in early Mesopotamian cities.
"Brick is the dominant material, as the material was freely available locally, whereas building stone had to be brought a considerable distance to most cities."
"The ziggurat is the most distinctive form, and cities often had large gateways, of which the Ishtar Gate from Neo-Babylonian Babylon, decorated with beasts in polychrome brick, is the most famous, now largely in the Pergamon Museum in Berlin."
"The most notable architectural remains from early Mesopotamia are the temple complexes at Uruk from the 4th millennium BC, temples and palaces from the Early Dynastic period sites in the Diyala River valley such as Khafajah and Tell Asmar, the Third Dynasty of Ur remains at Nippur (Sanctuary of Enlil) and Ur (Sanctuary of Nanna), Middle Bronze Age remains at Syrian-Turkish sites of Ebla, Mari, Alalakh, Aleppo and Kultepe, Late Bronze Age palaces at Hattusa, Ugarit, Ashur and Nuzi, Iron Age palaces and temples at Assyrian (Kalhu/Nimrud, Khorsabad, Nineveh), Babylonian (Babylon), Urartian (Tushpa/Van,  Kalesi, Cavustepe, Ayanis, Armavir, Erebuni, Bastam) and Neo-Hittite sites (Karkamis, Tell Halaf, Karatepe)."
Houses are mostly known from Old Babylonian remains at Nippur and Ur.
"Among the textual sources on building construction and associated rituals are Gudea's cylinders from the late 3rd millennium are notable, as well as the Assyrian and Babylonian royal inscriptions from the Iron Age."
Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin philosophia naturalis) was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science.
It is considered to be the precursor of natural science.
"From the ancient world, starting with Aristotle, to the 19th century, natural philosophy was the common term for the practice of studying nature."
"It was in the 19th century that the concept of ""science"" received its modern shape with new titles emerging such as ""biology"" and ""biologist"", ""physics"" and ""physicist"" among other technical fields and titles; institutions and communities were founded, and unprecedented applications to and interactions with other aspects of society and culture occurred."
"Isaac Newton's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), whose title translates to ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"", reflects the then-current use of the words ""natural philosophy"", akin to ""systematic study of nature""."
"Even in the 19th century, a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867)."
"In the German tradition, Naturphilosophie (philosophy of nature) persisted into the 18th and 19th century as an attempt to achieve a speculative unity of nature and spirit."
"Some of the greatest names in German philosophy are associated with this movement, including Goethe, Hegel and Schelling."
"Empirical science historically developed out of philosophy or, more specifically, natural philosophy."
"Natural philosophy was distinguished from the other precursor of modern science, natural history, in that natural philosophy involved reasoning and explanations about nature (and after Galileo, quantitative reasoning), whereas natural history was essentially qualitative and descriptive."
"In the 14th and 15th centuries, natural philosophy was one of many branches of philosophy, but was not a specialized field of study."
"The first person appointed as a specialist in Natural Philosophy per se was Jacopo Zabarella, at the University of Padua in 1577."
Modern meanings of the terms science and scientists date only to the 19th century.
"Before that, science was a synonym for knowledge or study, in keeping with its Latin origin."
"In general, chairs of Natural Philosophy established long ago at the oldest universities are nowadays occupied mainly by physics professors."
"Isaac Newton's book Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687), whose title translates to ""Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy"", reflects the then-current use of the words ""natural philosophy"", akin to ""systematic study of nature""."
"Even in the 19th century, a treatise by Lord Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait, which helped define much of modern physics, was titled Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867)."
"Greek philosophers defined it as the combination of beings living in the universe, ignoring things made by humans."
The other definition refers to human nature.
Natural philosophy has been categorized as a theoretical rather than a practical branch of philosophy (like ethics).
The study of natural philosophy seeks to explore the cosmos by any means necessary to understand the universe.
Some ideas presuppose that change is a reality.
"Although this may seem obvious, there have been some philosophers who have denied the concept of metamorphosis, such as Plato's predecessor Parmenides and later Greek philosopher Sextus Empiricus, and perhaps some Eastern philosophers."
"George Santayana, in his Scepticism and Animal Faith, attempted to show that the reality of change cannot be proven."
"If his reasoning is sound, it follows that to be a physicist, one must restrain one's skepticism enough to trust one's senses, or else rely on anti-realism."
René Descartes' metaphysical system of mind–body dualism describes two kinds of substance: matter and mind.
"According to this system, everything that is ""matter"" is deterministic and natural—and so belongs to natural philosophy—and everything that is ""mind"" is volitional and non-natural, and falls outside the domain of philosophy of nature."
"Philosophical, and specifically non-religious thought about the natural world, goes back to ancient Greece."
"The thought of early philosophers such as Parmenides, Heraclitus, and Democritus centered on the natural world."
"In addition, three Presocratic philosophers who lived in the Ionian town of Miletus (hence the Milesian School of philosophy), Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, attempted to explain natural phenomena without recourse to  creation myths involving the Greek gods."
"They were called the physikoi (""natural philosophers"") or, as Aristotle referred to them, the physiologoi."
Plato followed Socrates in concentrating on man.
"This book determines the warp and woof of the whole of Western thinking, even at that place where it, as modern thinking, appears to think at odds with ancient thinking."
"But opposition is invariably comprised of a decisive, and often even perilous, dependence."
Without Aristotle's Physics there would have been no Galileo.
Aristotle surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.
"Plato's world of eternal and unchanging Forms, imperfectly represented in matter by a divine Artisan, contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic Weltanschauungen, of which atomism was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world."
"Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from Epicurus… while the Stoics adopted a divine teleology…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system."
"This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters."
"Cicero… preserves Aristotle's own cave-image: if troglodytes were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged."
"But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces."
"Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or phusis."
"If the artist works ""to make money,"" making money is in some way the cause of her action."
But we cannot describe this influence in terms of quantitative force.
"The final cause acts, but it acts according to the mode of final causality, as an end or good that induces the efficient cause to act."
"The mode of causality proper to the final cause cannot itself be reduced to efficient causality, much less to the mode of efficient causality we call ""force."""
The issue that medieval philosophers had with motion was the inconsistency found between book 3 of Physics and book 5 of Metaphysics.
"Aristotle claimed in book 3 of Physics that motion can be categorized by substance, quantity, quality, and place."
where in book 5 of Metaphysics he stated that motion is a magnitude of quantity.
This disputation led to some important questions to natural philosophers: Which category/categories does motion fit into?
There is an issue with the vocabulary behind motion which makes people think that there is a correlation between nouns and the qualities that make nouns.
"Ockham states that this distinction is what will allow people to understand motion, that motion is a property of mobiles, locations, and forms and that is all that is required to define what motion is."
A famous example of this is Occam's razor which simplifies vague statements by cutting them into more descriptive examples.
"becomes ""each thing that is moved, is moved by an agent"" this makes motion a more personal quality referring to individual objects that are moved."
"In becoming an oak tree, it becomes actually what it originally was only potentially."
"This change thus involves passage from potentiality to actuality — not from non-being to being but from one kind or degree to being another""Aristotle held many important beliefs that started a convergence of thought for natural philosophy."
"Aristotle believed that attributes of objects belong to the objects themselves, and share traits with other objects that fit them into a category."
He uses the example of dogs to press this point.
This philosophy can be applied to many other objects as well.
"This idea is different than that of Plato, with whom Aristotle had a direct association."
"Aristotle argued that objects have properties ""form"" and something that is not part of its properties ""matter"" that defines the object."
The form cannot be separated from the matter.
He used his philosophy of form and matter to argue that when something changes you change its properties without changing its matter.
This change occurs by replacing certain properties with other properties.
"Since this change is always an intentional alteration whether by forced means or by natural ones, change is a controllable order of qualities."
"He argues that this happens through three categories of being: non-being, potential being, and actual being."
Through these three states the process of changing an object never truly destroys an objects forms during this transition state but rather just blurs the reality between the two states.
An example of this could be changing an object from red to blue with a transitional purple phase.
"Figures like Hesiod regarded the Natural world as offspring of the gods, whereas others like Leucippus and Democritus regarded the world as lifeless atoms in a vortex."
Anaximander deduced that eclipses happen because of apertures in rings of celestial fire.
Heraclitus believed that the heavenly bodies were made of fire that were contained within bowls.
He thought that eclipses happen when the bowl turned away from the earth.
"Anaximenes is believed to have stated that an underlying element was air, and by manipulating air someone could change its thickness to create fire, water, dirt, and stones."
"Empedocles identified the elements that make up the world which he termed the roots of all things as Fire, Air."
Parmenides argued that all change is a logical impossibility.
He gives the example that nothing can go from nonexistence to existence.
Plato argues that the world is an imperfect replica of an idea that a divine craftsman once held.
"Galileo proposed that objects falling regardless of their mass would fall at the same rate, as long as the medium they fall in is identical."
The 19th-century distinction of a scientific enterprise apart from traditional natural philosophy has its roots in prior centuries.
"Proposals for a more ""inquisitive"" and practical approach to the study of nature are notable in Francis Bacon, whose ardent convictions did much to popularize his insightful Baconian method."
The Baconian method is employed throughout Thomas Browne's encyclopaedia  Pseudodoxia Epidemica (1646-72) which debunks a wide-range of common fallacies through empirical investigation of nature.
"The late 17th-century natural philosopher Robert Boyle wrote a seminal work on the distinction between physics and metaphysics called, A Free Enquiry into the Vulgarly Received Notion of Nature, as well as The Skeptical Chymist, after which the modern science of chemistry is named, (as distinct from proto-scientific studies of alchemy)."
"These works of natural philosophy are representative of a departure from the medieval scholasticism taught in European universities, and anticipate in many ways, the developments which would lead to science as practiced in the modern sense."
"As Bacon would say, ""vexing nature"" to reveal ""her"" secrets, (scientific experimentation), rather than a mere reliance on largely historical, even anecdotal, observations of empirical phenomena, would come to be regarded as a defining characteristic of modern science, if not the very key to its success."
"Boyle's biographers, in their emphasis that he laid the foundations of modern chemistry, neglect how steadily he clung to the scholastic sciences in theory, practice and doctrine."
"However, he meticulously recorded observational detail on practical research, and subsequently advocated not only this practice, but its publication, both for successful and unsuccessful experiments, so as to validate individual claims by replication."
"For sometimes we use the word nature for that Author of nature whom the schoolmen, harshly enough, call natura naturans, as when it is said that nature hath made man partly corporeal and partly immaterial."
"Sometimes we mean by the nature of a thing the essence, or that which the schoolmen scruple not to call the quiddity of a thing, namely, the attribute or attributes on whose score it is what it is, whether the thing be corporeal or not, as when we attempt to define the nature of an angel, or of a triangle, or of a fluid body, as such."
"Sometimes we take nature for an internal principle of motion, as when we say that a stone let fall in the air is by nature carried towards the centre of the earth, and, on the contrary, that fire or flame does naturally move upwards toward heaven."
"Sometimes we understand by nature the established course of things, as when we say that nature makes the night succeed the day, nature hath made respiration necessary to the life of men."
"Sometimes we take nature for an aggregate of powers belonging to a body, especially a living one, as when physicians say that nature is strong or weak or spent, or that in such or such diseases nature left to herself will do the cure."
"And sometimes too, and that most commonly, we would express by nature a semi-deity or other strange kind of being, such as this discourse examines the notion of."
Natural philosophers of the late 17th or early 18th century were sometimes insultingly described as 'projectors'.
"A projector was an entrepreneur who invited people to invest in his invention but - as the caricature went - could not be trusted, usually because his device was impractical."
Jonathan Swift satirized natural philosophers of the Royal Society as 'the academy of projectors' in his novel Gulliver's Travels.
Nature is reduced to a passive recipient of human activity.
"One line of thought grows from the Aristotelian tradition, especially as developed by Thomas Aquinas."
"Another line springs from Edmund Husserl, especially as expressed in The Crisis of European Sciences."
Students of his such as Jacob Klein and Hans Jonas more fully developed his themes.
"David Oderberg (2007) takes issue with other philosophers, including Ellis to a degree, who claim to be essentialists."
"In his In Praise of Natural Philosophy: A Revolution for Thought and Life (2017), Nicholas Maxwell argues that we need to reform philosophy and put science and philosophy back together again to create a modern version of natural philosophy."
"Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation."
Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.
Natural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science.
"Life science is alternatively known as biology, and physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, chemistry, Earth science, and astronomy."
These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).
"Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way."
"Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science."
"Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on."
"Today, ""natural history"" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences."
"Validity, accuracy, and quality control, such as peer review and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in today's global scientific community."
The scale of study can range from sub-component biophysics up to complex ecologies.
"Biology is concerned with the characteristics, classification and behaviors of organisms, as well as how species were formed and their interactions with each other and the environment."
"The biological fields of botany, zoology, and medicine date back to early periods of civilization, while microbiology was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope."
"However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science."
"Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole."
Some key developments in biology were the discovery of genetics; evolution through natural selection; the germ theory of disease and the application of the techniques of chemistry and physics at the level of the cell or organic molecule.
Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied.
"Molecular biology is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while cellular biology is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life."
"At a higher level, anatomy and physiology look at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while ecology looks at how various organisms interrelate."
"Although mining and precious stones have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of economic geology and mineralogy did not occur until the 18th century."
"The study of the earth, particularly palaeontology, blossomed in the 19th century."
"The growth of other disciplines, such as geophysics, in the 20th century, led to the development of the theory of plate tectonics in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology."
"Earth sciences today are closely linked to petroleum and mineral resources, climate research and to environmental assessment and remediation."
This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the space.
The timescale of the study also varies from days to centuries.
Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.
"As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject."
"Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices."
As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.
"The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied."
Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.
"Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes."
"Chemistry is often called ""the central science"" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences."
"Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of Alchemy, a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments."
"The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of Robert Boyle, the discoverer of gas, and Antoine Lavoisier, who developed the theory of the Conservation of mass."
"The discovery of the chemical elements and atomic theory began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of states of matter, ions, chemical bonds and chemical reactions."
The success of this science led to a complementary chemical industry that now plays a significant role in the world economy.
"In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field."
Physics relies heavily on mathematics as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.
The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation.
"The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with philosophy gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification."
"Key historical developments in physics include Isaac Newton's theory of universal gravitation and classical mechanics, an understanding of electricity and its relation to magnetism, Einstein's theories of special and general relativity, the development of thermodynamics, and the quantum mechanical model of atomic and subatomic physics."
"The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as quantum mechanics and theoretical physics, applied physics and optics."
"Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being ""universalists"" like Isaac Newton, Albert Einstein and Lev Landau, who worked in multiple areas."
"Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies and comets."
Astronomy is the study of everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere.
That includes objects we can see with our naked eyes.
Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences.
"Astronomers of early civilizations performed methodical observations of the night sky, and astronomical artifacts have been found from much earlier periods."
"There are two types of astronomy, observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy."
"Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring and analyzing data, mainly using basic principles of physics while Theoretical astronomy is oriented towards the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena."
This discipline is the science of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere.
"It is concerned with the evolution, physics, chemistry, meteorology, and motion of celestial objects, as well as the formation and development of the universe."
"Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of stars, planets, comets."
"Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the interstellar medium)."
"While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century."
A key factor was Galileo's introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.
"The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with Newton's development of celestial mechanics and the laws of gravitation, although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as Kepler."
"By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the spectroscope and photography, along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories."
"Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by astrophysics, geophysics, chemical physics and biophysics."
"Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as biochemistry, chemical biology, geochemistry and astrochemistry."
A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is environmental science.
"This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and biological components of the environment, with particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on biodiversity and sustainability."
"This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law, and social sciences."
"A comparable discipline is oceanography, as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines."
"Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as physical oceanography and marine biology."
"As the marine ecosystem is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular species."
"Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of the most dialog."
"Such integrative fields, for example, include nanoscience, astrobiology, and complex system informatics."
"Originally developed through the field of metallurgy, the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials."
"The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others."
The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.
It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering.
"It is an important part of forensic engineering (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and failure analysis, the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents."
"Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology."
"The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their properties."
"Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application."
The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form.
"These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of thermodynamics and kinetics, govern a material's microstructure, and thus its properties."
"People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation."
"These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the Mesopotamian and Ancient Egyptian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of natural philosophy, the precursor of natural science."
"They focused on the yin and yang, or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth."
"The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature."
"Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned."
The ashes left by fire were earth.
They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.
"Surgeons in the Ayurvedic tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: wind, bile and phlegm."
A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.
"In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space."
Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.
"Thales of Miletus, an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature."
"In the 5th century BC, Leucippus was an early exponent of atomism, the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles."
"Pythagoras applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was spherical."
"Aristotle, however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy."
"In his History of Animals, he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the stingray, catfish and bee."
He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.
"Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the father of biology for his pioneering work in that science."
"He also presented philosophies about physics, nature, and astronomy using inductive reasoning in his works Physics and Meteorology."
"While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science."
"Still, inspired by his work, Ancient Roman  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including Lucretius, Seneca and Pliny the Elder, wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth."
Many Ancient Roman Neoplatonists of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.
"Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument."
He introduced the theory of impetus.
"The words alcohol, algebra and zenith all have Arabic roots."
The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.
"European inventions such as the horseshoe, horse collar and crop rotation allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day France and England."
"Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian theology developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic."
"This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as heresy."
"By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars."
"Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy."
"These works were taught at new universities in Paris and Oxford by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church."
"A 1210 decree from the Synod of Paris ordered that ""no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."
"""In the late Middle Ages, Spanish philosopher Dominicus Gundissalinus translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar Al-Farabi called On the Sciences into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature scientia naturalis, or natural science."
Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work On the Division of Philosophy.
This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.
"Gundissalinus defined natural science as ""the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion,"" as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics."
"Robert Kilwardby wrote On the Order of the Sciences in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion."
"Roger Bacon, an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with ""a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."""
"These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies."
"Later in the 13th century, a Catholic priest and theologian Thomas Aquinas defined natural science as dealing with ""mobile beings"" and  ""things which depend on a matter not only for their existence but also for their definition."""
"There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective."
"Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle."
"The interaction between natural philosophy and Christianity was complex during this period; some early theologians, including Tatian and Eusebius, considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it."
"Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries."
"The Condemnation of 1277, which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective."
"Aquinas and Albertus Magnus, another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works."
"""I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith,"" he wrote in 1271."
"The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the Protestant Reformation fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West."
"Christopher Columbus's discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by Copernicus, Tyco Brahe and Galileo brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as heliocentric and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false."
Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.
"To achieve this, he wrote that ""human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."""
"He defined natural philosophy as ""the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."""
"Bacon proposed that scientific inquiry be supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time."
"Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock."
"Natural philosophers including Isaac Newton, Evangelista Torricelli and Francesco Redi conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring atmospheric pressure using a barometer and disproving spontaneous generation."
"Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the scientific revolution."
"According to Cohen, ""the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."""
"Other historians of science, including Edward Grant, contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy."
"Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics."
"The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry."
One of its principal advances was the use of the scientific method to investigate nature.
Data was collected and repeatable measurements made in experiments.
Scientists then formed hypotheses to explain the results of these experiments.
The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of falsifiability to prove or disprove its accuracy.
"Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe, and Kepler, Newton derived the universal law of gravitation and laws of motion."
"These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules."
"Newton, for example, showed that the tides were caused by the gravitational pull of the moon."
Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.
"Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in ""fields"" that filled space."
"The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply ""action at a distance"", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene."
James Clerk Maxwell in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent theory of electrodynamics.
"Antoine Lavoisier, a French chemist, refuted the phlogiston theory, which posited that things burned by releasing ""phlogiston"" into the air."
"Joseph Priestley had discovered oxygen in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that combustion was the result of oxidation."
He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.
"Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the classification and categorization of natural life."
"This growth in natural history was led by Carl Linnaeus, whose 1735 taxonomy of the natural world is still in use."
Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced scientific names for all his species.
"In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of natural science."
The term scientist was coined by William Whewell in an 1834 review of Mary Somerville's On the Connexion of the Sciences.
But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.
"A nuclear weapon (also called an atom bomb, nuke, atomic bomb, nuclear warhead, A-bomb, or nuclear bomb) is an explosive device that derives its destructive force from nuclear reactions, either fission (fission bomb) or from a combination of fission and fusion reactions (thermonuclear bomb)."
Both bomb types release large quantities of energy from relatively small amounts of matter.
"The first test of a fission (""atomic"") bomb released an amount of energy approximately equal to 20,000 tons of TNT (84 TJ)."
"The first thermonuclear (""hydrogen"") bomb test released energy approximately equal to 10 million tons of TNT (42 PJ)."
"A nuclear device no larger than traditional bombs can devastate an entire city by blast, fire, and radiation."
"Since they are weapons of mass destruction, the proliferation of nuclear weapons is a focus of international relations policy."
"These bombings caused injuries that resulted in the deaths of approximately 200,000 civilians and military personnel."
The ethics of these bombings and their role in Japan's surrender are subjects of debate.
"Since the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, nuclear weapons have been detonated over 2,000 times for testing and demonstration."
Only a few nations possess such weapons or are suspected of seeking them.
"The only countries known to have detonated nuclear weapons—and acknowledge possessing them—are (chronologically by date of first test) the United States, the Soviet Union (succeeded as a nuclear power by Russia), the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, and North Korea."
"Israel is believed to possess nuclear weapons, though, in a policy of deliberate ambiguity, it does not acknowledge having them."
"Germany, Italy, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands are nuclear weapons sharing states."
Modernisation of weapons continues to this day.
Weapons whose explosive output is exclusively from fission reactions are commonly referred to as atomic bombs or atom bombs (abbreviated as A-bombs).
"This has long been noted as something of a misnomer, as their energy comes from the nucleus of the atom, just as it does with fusion weapons."
"In fission weapons, a mass of fissile material (enriched uranium or plutonium) is forced into supercriticality—allowing an exponential growth of nuclear chain reactions—either by shooting one piece of sub-critical material into another (the ""gun"" method) or by compression of a sub-critical sphere or cylinder of fissile material using chemically-fueled explosive lenses."
"The latter approach, the ""implosion"" method, is more sophisticated than the former."
A major challenge in all nuclear weapon designs is to ensure that a significant fraction of the fuel is consumed before the weapon destroys itself.
"Many fission products are either highly radioactive (but short-lived) or moderately radioactive (but long-lived), and as such, they are a serious form of radioactive contamination."
Fission products are the principal radioactive component of nuclear fallout.
Another source of radioactivity is the burst of free neutrons produced by the weapon.
"When they collide with other nuclei in surrounding material, the neutrons transmute those nuclei into other isotopes, altering their stability and making them radioactive."
The most commonly used fissile materials for nuclear weapons applications have been uranium-235 and plutonium-239.
Less commonly used has been uranium-233.
"Neptunium-237 and some isotopes of americium may be usable for nuclear explosives as well, but it is not clear that this has ever been implemented, and their plausible use in nuclear weapons is a matter of dispute."
"Such fusion weapons are generally referred to as thermonuclear weapons or more colloquially as hydrogen bombs (abbreviated as H-bombs), as they rely on fusion reactions between isotopes of hydrogen (deuterium and tritium)."
"Whether India has detonated a ""true"" multi-staged thermonuclear weapon is controversial."
"North Korea claims to have tested a fusion weapon as of January 2016, though this claim is disputed."
Thermonuclear weapons are considered much more difficult to successfully design and execute than primitive fission weapons.
"In the Teller-Ulam design, which accounts for all multi-megaton yield hydrogen bombs, this is accomplished by placing a fission bomb and fusion fuel (tritium, deuterium, or lithium deuteride) in proximity within a special, radiation-reflecting container."
"When the fission bomb is detonated, gamma rays and X-rays emitted first compress the fusion fuel, then heat it to thermonuclear temperatures."
"The ensuing fusion reaction creates enormous numbers of high-speed neutrons, which can then induce fission in materials not normally prone to it, such as depleted uranium."
"Each of these components is known as a ""stage"", with the fission bomb as the ""primary"" and the fusion capsule as the ""secondary""."
"This technique can be used to construct thermonuclear weapons of arbitrarily large yield, in contrast to fission bombs, which are limited in their explosive force."
"The largest nuclear weapon ever detonated, the Tsar Bomba of the USSR, which released an energy equivalent of over 50 megatons of TNT (210 PJ), was a three-stage weapon."
"Most thermonuclear weapons are considerably smaller than this, due to practical constraints from missile warhead space and weight requirements."
"Fusion reactions do not create fission products, and thus contribute far less to the creation of nuclear fallout than fission reactions, but because all thermonuclear weapons contain at least one fission stage, and many high-yield thermonuclear devices have a final fission stage, thermonuclear weapons can generate at least as much nuclear fallout as fission-only weapons."
"For example, a boosted fission weapon is a fission bomb that increases its explosive yield through a small number of fusion reactions, but it is not a fusion bomb."
"In the boosted bomb, the neutrons produced by the fusion reactions serve primarily to increase the efficiency of the fission bomb."
"There are two types of boosted fission bomb: internally boosted, in which a deuterium-tritium mixture is injected into the bomb core, and externally boosted, in which concentric shells of lithium-deuteride and depleted uranium are layered on the outside of the fission bomb core."
Some nuclear weapons are designed for special purposes; a neutron bomb is a thermonuclear weapon that yields a relatively small explosion but a relatively large amount of neutron radiation; such a device could theoretically be used to cause massive casualties while leaving infrastructure mostly intact and creating a minimal amount of fallout.
The detonation of any nuclear weapon is accompanied by a blast of neutron radiation.
Surrounding a nuclear weapon with suitable materials (such as cobalt or gold) creates a weapon known as a salted bomb.
This device can produce exceptionally large quantities of long-lived radioactive contamination.
"It has been conjectured that such a device could serve as a ""doomsday weapon"" because such a large quantity of radioactivities with half-lives of decades, lifted into the stratosphere where winds would distribute it around the globe, would make all life on the planet extinct."
"In connection with the Strategic Defense Initiative, research into the nuclear pumped laser was conducted under the DOD program Project Excalibur but this did not result in a working weapon."
The concept involves the tapping of the energy of an exploding nuclear bomb to power a single-shot laser which is directed at a distant target.
"During the Starfish Prime high-altitude nuclear test in 1962, an unexpected effect was produced which is called a nuclear electromagnetic pulse."
This is an intense flash of electromagnetic energy produced by a rain of high energy electrons which in turn are produced by a nuclear bomb's gamma rays.
This flash of energy can permanently destroy or disrupt electronic equipment if insufficiently shielded.
It has been proposed to use this effect to disable an enemy's military and civilian infrastructure as an adjunct to other nuclear or conventional military operations against that enemy.
"Because the effect is produced by high altitude nuclear detonations, it can produce damage to electronics over a wide, even continental, geographical area."
Research has been done into the possibility of pure fusion bombs: nuclear weapons that consist of fusion reactions without requiring a fission bomb to initiate them.
"Such a device might provide a simpler path to thermonuclear weapons than one that required development of fission weapons first, and pure fusion weapons would create significantly less nuclear fallout than other thermonuclear weapons, because they would not disperse fission products."
"A major obstacle is the difficulty of producing antimatter in large enough quantities, and there is no evidence that it is feasible beyond the military domain."
This method places few restrictions on the size of the weapon.
"It does, however, limit attack range, response time to an impending attack, and the number of weapons that a country can field at the same time."
"With miniaturization, nuclear bombs can be delivered by both strategic bombers and tactical fighter-bombers."
"Preferable from a strategic point of view is a nuclear weapon mounted on a missile, which can use a ballistic trajectory to deliver the warhead over the horizon."
"Although even short-range missiles allow for a faster and less vulnerable attack, the development of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) has given some nations the ability to plausibly deliver missiles anywhere on the globe with a high likelihood of success."
"More advanced systems, such as multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles (MIRVs), can launch multiple warheads at different targets from one missile, reducing the chance of a successful missile defense."
"Today, missiles are most common among systems designed for delivery of nuclear weapons."
An atomic mortar has been tested by the United States.
"Small, two-man portable tactical weapons (somewhat misleadingly referred to as suitcase bombs), such as the Special Atomic Demolition Munition, have been developed, although the difficulty of combining sufficient yield with portability limits their military utility."
The policy of trying to prevent an attack by a nuclear weapon from another country by threatening nuclear retaliation is known as the strategy of nuclear deterrence.
The goal in deterrence is to always maintain a second strike capability (the ability of a country to respond to a nuclear attack with one of its own) and potentially to strive for first strike status (the ability to destroy an enemy's nuclear forces before they could retaliate).
"During the Cold War, policy and military theorists considered the sorts of policies that might prevent a nuclear attack, and they developed game theory models that could lead to stable deterrence conditions."
Different forms of nuclear weapons delivery (see above) allow for different types of nuclear strategies.
The goals of any strategy are generally to make it difficult for an enemy to launch a pre-emptive strike against the weapon system and difficult to defend against the delivery of the weapon during a potential conflict.
"This can mean keeping weapon locations hidden, such as deploying them on submarines or land mobile transporter erector launchers whose locations are difficult to track, or it can mean protecting weapons by burying them in hardened missile silo bunkers."
"Other components of nuclear strategies included using missile defenses to destroy the missiles before they land, or implementing civil defense measures using early-warning systems to evacuate citizens to safe areas before an attack."
Weapons designed to threaten large populations or to deter attacks are known as strategic weapons.
Nuclear weapons for use on a battlefield in military situations are called tactical weapons.
Critics of nuclear war strategy often suggest that a nuclear war between two nations would result in mutual annihilation.
"From this point of view, the significance of nuclear weapons is to deter war because any nuclear war would escalate out of mutual distrust and fear, resulting in mutually assured destruction."
"This threat of national, if not global, destruction has been a strong motivation for anti-nuclear weapons activism."
Critics from the peace movement and within the military establishment have questioned the usefulness of such weapons in the current military climate.
"According to an advisory opinion issued by the International Court of Justice in 1996, the use of (or threat of use of) such weapons would generally be contrary to the rules of international law applicable in armed conflict, but the court did not reach an opinion as to whether or not the threat or use would be lawful in specific extreme circumstances such as if the survival of the state were at stake."
Another deterrence position is that nuclear proliferation can be desirable.
"Some prominent neo-realist scholars, such as Kenneth Waltz and John Mearsheimer, have argued, along the lines of Gallois, that some forms of nuclear proliferation would decrease the likelihood of total war, especially in troubled regions of the world where there exists a single nuclear-weapon state."
"Aside from the public opinion that opposes proliferation in any form, there are two schools of thought on the matter: those, like Mearsheimer, who favored selective proliferation, and Waltz, who was somewhat more non-interventionist."
The prospect of mutually assured destruction might not deter an enemy who expects to die in the confrontation.
"Further, if the initial act is from a stateless terrorist instead of a sovereign nation, there might not be a nation or specific target to retaliate against."
"It has been argued, especially after the September 11, 2001, attacks, that this complication calls for a new nuclear strategy, one that is distinct from that which gave relative stability during the Cold War."
"By threatening retaliation against those states, the United States may be able to deter that which it cannot physically prevent."
"By identifying unique attributes of the fissile material, including its impurities and contaminants, one could trace the path back to its origin."""
The process is analogous to identifying a criminal by fingerprints.
"In most countries, the use of nuclear force can only be authorized by the head of government or head of state."
"The Russell–Einstein Manifesto was issued in London on July 9, 1955, by Bertrand Russell in the midst of the Cold War."
It highlighted the dangers posed by nuclear weapons and called for world leaders to seek peaceful resolutions to international conflict.
"The signatories included eleven pre-eminent intellectuals and scientists, including Albert Einstein, who signed it just days before his death on April 18, 1955."
"This conference was to be the first of the Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs, held in July 1957."
"By the 1960s, steps were taken to limit both the proliferation of nuclear weapons to other countries and the environmental effects of nuclear testing."
"The Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (1963) restricted all nuclear testing to underground nuclear testing, to prevent contamination from nuclear fallout, whereas the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (1968) attempted to place restrictions on the types of activities signatories could participate in, with the goal of allowing the transference of non-military nuclear technology to member countries without fear of proliferation."
"In 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) was established under the mandate of the United Nations to encourage development of peaceful applications of nuclear technology, provide international safeguards against its misuse, and facilitate the application of safety measures in its use."
"In 1996, many nations signed the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, which prohibits all testing of nuclear weapons."
A testing ban imposes a significant hindrance to nuclear arms development by any complying country.
"Even when they did not enter into force, these agreements helped limit and later reduce the numbers and types of nuclear weapons between the United States and the Soviet Union/Russia."
Nuclear weapons have also been opposed by agreements between countries.
"Many nations have been declared Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zones, areas where nuclear weapons production and deployment are prohibited, through the use of treaties."
"The Treaty of Tlatelolco (1967) prohibited any production or deployment of nuclear weapons in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the Treaty of Pelindaba (1964) prohibits nuclear weapons in many African countries."
As recently as 2006 a Central Asian Nuclear Weapon Free Zone was established among the former Soviet republics of Central Asia prohibiting nuclear weapons.
"In 1996, the International Court of Justice, the highest court of the United Nations, issued an Advisory Opinion concerned with the ""Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons""."
"The court ruled that the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons would violate various articles of international law, including the Geneva Conventions, the Hague Conventions, the UN Charter, and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights."
"In the wake of the tests by India and Pakistan in 1998, economic sanctions were (temporarily) levied against both countries, though neither were signatories with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty."
One of the stated casus belli for the initiation of the 2003 Iraq War was an accusation by the United States that Iraq was actively pursuing nuclear arms (though this was soon discovered not to be the case as the program had been discontinued).
"In 1981, Israel had bombed a nuclear reactor being constructed in Osirak, Iraq, in what it called an attempt to halt Iraq's previous nuclear arms ambitions; in 2007, Israel bombed another reactor being constructed in Syria."
"Beginning with the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty and continuing through the 1996 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there have been many treaties to limit or reduce nuclear weapons testing and stockpiles."
"The 1968 Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty has as one of its explicit conditions that all signatories must ""pursue negotiations in good faith"" towards the long-term goal of ""complete disarmament""."
"The former Soviet republics of Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine returned Soviet nuclear arms stationed in their countries to Russia after the collapse of the USSR."
"Proponents of nuclear disarmament say that it would lessen the probability of nuclear war, especially accidentally."
Critics of nuclear disarmament say that it would undermine the present nuclear peace and deterrence and would lead to increased global instability.
"Various American elder statesmen, who were in office during the Cold War period, have been advocating the elimination of nuclear weapons."
"These officials include Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, Sam Nunn, and William Perry."
"In January 1986, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev publicly proposed a three-stage program for abolishing the world's nuclear weapons by the end of the 20th century."
"In the years after the end of the Cold War, there have been numerous campaigns to urge the abolition of nuclear weapons, such as that organized by the Global Zero movement, and the goal of a ""world without nuclear weapons"" was advocated by United States President Barack Obama in an April 2009 speech in Prague."
"Kenneth Waltz has argued that nuclear weapons have helped keep an uneasy peace, and further nuclear weapon proliferation might even help avoid the large scale conventional wars that were so common before their invention at the end of World War II."
"But former Secretary Henry Kissinger says there is a new danger, which cannot be addressed by deterrence: ""The classical notion of deterrence was that there was some consequences before which aggressors and evildoers would recoil."
"In a world of suicide bombers, that calculation doesn’t operate in any comparable way""."
"It also promotes disarmament efforts in the area of conventional weapons, especially land mines and small arms, which are often the weapons of choice in contemporary conflicts."
"The question of whether nations should have nuclear weapons, or test them, has been continually and nearly universally controversial."
"After these 2 incidents, the core was used to construct a bomb for use on the Nevada Test Range."
This was the first such nuclear weapon loss in history.
"The accident was designated a ""Broken Arrow""—an accident involving a nuclear weapon but which does not present a risk of war."
Experts believe that up to 50 nuclear weapons were lost during the Cold War.
"According to a researcher at the Natural Resources Defense Council, it was one of the most powerful bombs made to date."
"January 24, 1961: the 1961 Goldsboro B-52 crash occurred near Goldsboro, North Carolina."
"A Boeing B-52 Stratofortress carrying two Mark 39 nuclear bombs broke up in mid-air, dropping its nuclear payload in the process."
"1965 Philippine Sea A-4 crash, where a Skyhawk attack aircraft with a nuclear weapon fell into the sea."
"The pilot, the aircraft, and the B43 nuclear bomb were never recovered."
It was not until 1989 that the Pentagon revealed the loss of the one-megaton bomb.
"The fourth, which fell into the Mediterranean Sea, was recovered intact after a 2½-month-long search."
"January 21, 1968: the 1968 Thule Air Base B-52 crash involved a United States Air Force (USAF) B-52 bomber."
The aircraft was carrying four hydrogen bombs when a cabin fire forced the crew to abandon the aircraft.
"Six crew members ejected safely, but one who did not have an ejection seat was killed while trying to bail out."
"The bomber crashed onto sea ice in Greenland, causing the nuclear payload to rupture and disperse, which resulted in widespread radioactive contamination."
One of the bombs remains lost.
"The accident was caused by a maintenance man who dropped a socket from a socket wrench down an 80-foot (24 m) shaft, puncturing a fuel tank on the rocket."
"Leaking fuel resulted in a hypergolic fuel explosion, jettisoning the W-53 warhead beyond the launch site."
Radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing was first drawn to public attention in 1954 when the Castle Bravo hydrogen bomb test at the Pacific Proving Grounds contaminated the crew and catch of the Japanese fishing boat Lucky Dragon.
"One of the fishermen died in Japan seven months later, and the fear of contaminated tuna led to a temporary boycotting of the popular staple in Japan."
"A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ National Cancer Institute study claims that fallout from atmospheric nuclear tests would lead to perhaps 11,000 excess deaths among people alive during atmospheric testing in the United States from all forms of cancer, including leukemia, from 1951 to well into the 21st century."
This period has some improvement in survivors' condition.
"Characterized by numerous complications, mostly related to healing of thermal and mechanical injuries, and if the individual was exposed to a few hundred to a thousand millisieverts of radiation, it is coupled with infertility, sub-fertility and blood disorders."
Radioactive fallout became less of an issue and the anti-nuclear weapons movement went into decline for some years.
A resurgence of interest occurred amid European and American fears of nuclear war in the 1980s.
57 percent of which was spent on building nuclear weapons delivery systems.
"During the 1960s and 1970s, both the United States and the Soviet Union conducted a number of PNEs."
"Six of the explosions by the Soviet Union are considered to have been of an applied nature, not just tests."
The United States and the Soviet Union later halted their programs.
Definitions and limits are covered in the Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty of 1976.
"The stalled Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty of 1996 would prohibit all nuclear explosions, regardless of whether they are for peaceful purposes or not."
Missile defenses will not allow us to escape our vulnerability to nuclear weapons.
"Instead large-scale developments will create barriers to taking real steps toward reducing nuclear risks—by blocking further cuts in nuclear arsenals and potentially spurring new deployments."""
"Porcelain is a ceramic material made by heating materials, generally including a material like kaolin, in a kiln to temperatures between 1,200 and 1,400 °C (2,200 and 2,600 °F)."
"The strength, and translucence of porcelain, relative to other types of pottery, arises mainly from vitrification and the formation of the mineral mullite within the body at these high temperatures."
"Though definitions vary, porcelain can be divided into three main categories: hard-paste, soft-paste and bone china."
The category that an object belongs to depends on the composition of the paste used to make the body of the porcelain object and the firing conditions.
"Porcelain slowly evolved in China and was finally achieved (depending on the definition used) at some point about 2,000 to 1,200 years ago, then slowly spread to other East Asian countries, and finally Europe and the rest of the world."
"Its manufacturing process is more demanding than that for earthenware and stoneware, the two other main types of pottery, and it has usually been regarded as the most prestigious type of pottery for its delicacy, strength, and its white colour."
"It combines well with both glazes and paint, and can be modelled very well, allowing a huge range of decorative treatments in tablewares, vessels and figurines."
It also has many uses in technology and industry.
"The European name, porcelain in English, comes from the old Italian porcellana (cowrie shell) because of its resemblance to the surface of the shell."
"Porcelain is also referred to as china or fine china in some English-speaking countries, as it was first seen in imports from China."
"Properties associated with porcelain include low permeability and elasticity; considerable strength, hardness, whiteness, translucency and resonance; and a high resistance to chemical attack and thermal shock."
"Porcelain has been described as being ""completely vitrified, hard, impermeable (even before glazing), white or artificially coloured, translucent (except when of considerable thickness), and resonant""."
"Terms such as ""proto-porcelain"", ""porcellaneous"" or ""near-porcelain"" may be used in cases where the ceramic body approaches whiteness and translucency."
"The earliest European porcelains were produced at the Meissen factory in the early 18th century; they were formed from a paste composed of kaolin and alabaster and fired at temperatures up to 1,400 °C (2,552 °F) in a wood-fired kiln, producing a porcelain of great hardness, translucency, and strength."
"Later, the composition of the Meissen hard paste was changed and the alabaster was replaced by feldspar and quartz, allowing the pieces to be fired at lower temperatures."
"Kaolinite, feldspar and quartz (or other forms of silica) continue to constitute the basic ingredients for most continental European hard-paste porcelains."
Soapstone and lime were known to have been included in these compositions.
These wares were not yet actual porcelain wares as they were not hard nor vitrified by firing kaolin clay at high temperatures.
"As these early formulations suffered from high pyroplastic deformation, or slumping in the kiln at high temperatures, they were uneconomic to produce and of low quality."
"Formulations were later developed based on kaolin with quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite or other feldspathic rocks."
"These were technically superior, and continue to be produced."
"Soft-paste porcelains are fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, therefore these wares are generally less hard than hard-paste porcelains."
"The English had read the letters of Jesuit missionary François Xavier d'Entrecolles, which described Chinese porcelain manufacturing secrets in detail."
But for example Royal Crown Derby still uses 50% bone ash in the 21st century.
The word paste is an old term for both the unfired and fired materials.
"A more common terminology for the unfired material is ""body""; for example, when buying materials a potter might order an amount of porcelain body from a vendor."
"The composition of porcelain is highly variable, but the clay mineral kaolinite is often a raw material."
"Other raw materials can include feldspar, ball clay, glass, bone ash, steatite, quartz, petuntse and alabaster."
"The clays used are often described as being long or short, depending on their plasticity."
Long clays are cohesive (sticky) and have high plasticity; short clays are less cohesive and have lower plasticity.
"In soil mechanics, plasticity is determined by measuring the increase in content of water required to change a clay from a solid state bordering on the plastic, to a plastic state bordering on the liquid, though the term is also used less formally to describe the ease with which a clay may be worked."
Clays used for porcelain are generally of lower plasticity and are shorter than many other pottery clays.
"They wet very quickly, meaning that small changes in the content of water can produce large changes in workability."
"Thus, the range of water content within which these clays can be worked is very narrow and consequently must be carefully controlled."
"It was originally typically made on the potter's wheel, though moulds were also used from early on."
Slipcasting has been the most common commercial method in recent times.
"Unlike their lower-fired counterparts, porcelain wares do not need glazing to render them impermeable to liquids and for the most part are glazed for decorative purposes and to make them resistant to dirt and staining."
"Many types of glaze, such as the iron-containing glaze used on the celadon wares of Longquan, were designed specifically for their striking effects on porcelain."
"Like many earlier wares, modern porcelains are often biscuit-fired at around 1,000 °C (1,830 °F), coated with glaze and then sent for a second glaze-firing at a temperature of about 1,300 °C (2,370 °F) or greater."
"Another early method is ""once-fired"", where the glaze is applied to the unfired body and the two fired together in a single operation."
Porcelain is fired at a higher temperature than earthenware so that the body can vitrify and become non-porous.
"Many types of porcelain in the past have been fired twice or even three times, to allow decoration using less robust pigments in overglaze enamel."
"By the time of the Eastern Han dynasty (AD 25–220) these early glazed ceramic wares had developed into porcelain, which Chinese defined as high-fired ware."
"By the late Sui dynasty (581–618 AD) and early Tang dynasty (618–907 AD), the now-standard requirements of whiteness and translucency had been achieved, in types such as Ding ware."
"During the Song dynasty (960–1279 AD), artistry and production had reached new heights."
"The manufacture of porcelain became highly organised, and the dragon kilns excavated from this period could fire as many as 25,000 pieces at a time, and over 100,000 by the end of the period."
"While Xing ware is regarded as among the greatest of the Tang dynasty porcelain, Ding ware became the premier porcelain of the Song dynasty."
"By the Ming dynasty, production of the finest wares for the court was concentrated in a single city, and Jingdezhen porcelain, originally owned by the imperial government, remains the centre of Chinese porcelain production."
"By the time of the Ming dynasty (1368–1644 AD), porcelain wares were being exported to Asia and Europe."
"Some of the most well-known Chinese porcelain art styles arrived in Europe during this era, such as the coveted ""blue-and-white"" wares."
"The Ming dynasty controlled much of the porcelain trade, which was expanded to Asia, Africa and Europe via the Silk Road."
"The most valued types can be identified by their association with the court, either as tribute offerings, or as products of kilns under imperial supervision."
"Since the Yuan dynasty, the largest and best centre of production has made Jingdezhen porcelain."
"During the Ming dynasty, Jingdezhen porcelain become a source of imperial pride."
"The Yongle emperor erected a white porcelain brick-faced pagoda at Nanjing, and an exceptionally smoothly glazed type of white porcelain is peculiar to his reign."
Jingdezhen porcelain's fame came to a peak during the Qing dynasty.
"They brought an improved type of kiln, and one of them spotted a source of porcelain clay near Arita, and before long several kilns had started in the region."
"Chinese exports had been seriously disrupted by civil wars as the Ming dynasty fell apart, and the Japanese exports increased rapidly to fill the gap."
"At first the wares used European shapes and mostly Chinese decoration, as the Chinese had done, but gradually original Japanese styles developed."
"Nabeshima ware was produced in kilns owned by the families of feudal lords, and were decorated in the Japanese tradition, much of it related to textile design."
"This was not initially exported, but used for gifts to other aristocratic families."
"Much traditional porcelain continues to replicate older methods of production and styles, and there are several modern industrial manufacturers."
"By the early 1900s, Filipino porcelain artisans working in Japanese porcelain centres for much of their lives, later on introduced the craft into the native population in the Philippines, although oral literature from Cebu in the central Philippines have noted that porcelain were already being produced by the natives locally during the time of Cebu's early rulers, prior to the arrival of colonizers in the 16th century."
The first mention of porcelain in Europe is in Il Milione by Marco Polo in the 13th century.
"Apart from copying Chinese porcelain in faience (tin glazed earthenware), the soft-paste Medici porcelain in 16th-century Florence was the first real European attempt to reproduce it, with little success."
"Early in the 16th century, Portuguese traders returned home with samples of kaolin, which they discovered in China to be essential in the production of porcelain wares."
"However, the Chinese techniques and composition used to manufacture porcelain were not yet fully understood."
Countless experiments to produce porcelain had unpredictable results and met with failure.
"In the German state of Saxony, the search concluded in 1708 when Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus produced a hard, white, translucent type of porcelain specimen with a combination of ingredients, including kaolin and alabaster, mined from a Saxon mine in Colditz."
"The secrets, which d'Entrecolles read about and witnessed in China, were now known and began seeing use in Europe."
"Tschirnhaus had a wide knowledge of science and had been involved in the European quest to perfect porcelain manufacture when, in 1705, Böttger was appointed to assist him in this task."
"Böttger had originally been trained as a pharmacist; after he turned to alchemical research, he claimed to have known the secret of transmuting dross into gold, which attracted the attention of Augustus."
"Imprisoned by Augustus as an incentive to hasten his research, Böttger was obliged to work with other alchemists in the futile search for transmutation and was eventually assigned to assist Tschirnhaus."
One of the first results of the collaboration between the two was the development of a red stoneware that resembled that of Yixing.
"A workshop note records that the first specimen of hard, white and vitrified European porcelain was produced in 1708."
"At the time, the research was still being supervised by Tschirnhaus; however, he died in October of that year."
It was left to Böttger to report to Augustus in March 1709 that he could make porcelain.
"Meissen porcelain was once-fired, or green-fired."
It was noted for its great resistance to thermal shock; a visitor to the factory in Böttger's time reported having seen a white-hot teapot being removed from the kiln and dropped into cold water without damage.
Although widely disbelieved this has been replicated in modern times.
"In France they were known as pâte tendre and in England as ""soft-paste""."
"They appear to have been given this name because they do not easily retain their shape in the wet state, or because they tend to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched."
"FranceExperiments at Rouen produced the earliest soft-paste in France, but the first important French soft-paste porcelain was made at the Saint-Cloud factory before 1702."
Soft-paste factories were established with the Chantilly manufactory in 1730 and at Mennecy in 1750.
"The Vincennes porcelain factory was established in 1740, moving to larger premises at Sèvres in 1756."
"Vincennes soft-paste was whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/Sèvres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century."
"All these were very successful, with large outputs of high-quality wares."
"In and around Venice, Francesco Vezzi was producing hard-paste from around 1720 to 1735; survivals of Vezzi porcelain are very rare, but less so than from the Hewelke factory, which only lasted from 1758 to 1763."
EnglandThe first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the Royal Society in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula.
"In 1749, Thomas Frye took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash."
"This was the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode."
"William Cookworthy discovered deposits of kaolin in Cornwall, and his factory at Plymouth, established in 1768, used kaolin and china stone to make hard-paste porcelain with a body composition similar to that of the Chinese porcelains of the early 18th century."
"But the great success of English ceramics in the 18th century was based on soft-paste porcelain, and refined earthenwares such as creamware, which could compete with porcelain, and had devastated the faience industries of France and other continental countries by the end of the century."
Most English porcelain from the late 18th century to the present is bone china.
"The technology of making ""white gold"" was carefully hidden by its creators."
"Peter the Great had tried to reveal the ""big porcelain secret"", and sent an agent to the Meissen factory, and finally hired a porcelain master from abroad."
This relied on the research of the Russian scientist Dmitry Ivanovich Vinogradov.
"His development of porcelain manufacturing technology was not based on secrets learned through third parties, but was the result of painstaking work and careful analysis."
"Porcelain is an excellent insulator for use with high voltages, especially in outdoor applications (see Insulator (electricity)#Material)."
"Examples include: terminals for high-voltage cables, bushings of power transformers, and insulation of high-frequency antennas."
Modern porcelain tiles are generally produced by a number of recognised international standards and definitions.
"Manufacturers are found across the world with Italy being the global leader, producing over 380 million square metres in 2006."
"Historic examples of rooms decorated entirely in porcelain tiles can be found in several European palaces including ones at Galleria Sabauda in Turin, Museo di Doccia in Sesto Fiorentino, Museo di Capodimonte in Naples, the Royal Palace of Madrid and the nearby Royal Palace of Aranjuez."
"Research is ""creative and systematic work undertaken to increase the stock of knowledge""."
"It involves the collection, organization, and analysis of information to increase understanding of a topic or issue."
A research project may be an expansion on past work in the field.
"To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole."
"The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, and the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge."
"Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences."
"There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological, etc."
The scientific study of research practices is known as meta-research.
The earliest recorded use of the term was in 1577.
"One definition of research is used by the OECD, ""Any creative systematic activity undertaken in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this knowledge to devise new applications."
This material is of a primary-source character.
"Original research can take a number of forms, depending on the discipline it pertains to."
"In analytical work, there are typically some new (for example) mathematical results produced, or a new way of approaching an existing problem."
This research provides scientific information and theories for the explanation of the nature and the properties of the world.
It makes practical applications possible.
"Scientific research is funded by public authorities, by charitable organizations and by private groups, including many companies."
Scientific research can be subdivided into different classifications according to their academic and application disciplines.
"Humanities scholars usually do not search for the ultimate correct answer to a question, but instead, explore the issues and details that surround it."
"Context is always important, and context can be social, historical, political, cultural, or ethnic."
"An example of research in the humanities is historical research, which is embodied in historical method."
"Historians use primary sources and other evidence to systematically investigate a topic, and then to write histories in the form of accounts of the past."
"Other studies aim to merely examine the occurrence of behaviours in societies and communities, without particularly looking for reasons or motivations to explain these."
It is the debatable body of thought which offers an alternative to purely scientific methods in research in its search for knowledge and truth.
The subject area should not be randomly chosen since it requires reading a vast amount of literature on the topic to determine the gap in the literature the researcher intends to narrow.
A keen interest in the chosen subject area is advisable.
The research will have to be justified by linking its importance to already existing knowledge about the topic.
Hypothesis: A testable prediction which designates the relationship between two or more variables.
Conceptual definition: Description of a concept by relating it to other concepts.
Operational definition: Details in regards to defining the variables and how they will be measured/assessed in the study.
"Gathering of data: Consists of identifying a population and selecting samples, gathering information from or about these samples by using specific research instruments."
The instruments used for data collection must be valid and reliable.
Analysis of data: Involves breaking down the individual pieces of data to draw conclusions about it.
"Data Interpretation: This can be represented through tables, figures, and pictures, and then described in words."
"Generally, a hypothesis is used to make predictions that can be tested by observing the outcome of an experiment."
"If the outcome is inconsistent with the hypothesis, then the hypothesis is rejected (see falsifiability)."
"However, if the outcome is consistent with the hypothesis, the experiment is said to support the hypothesis."
This careful language is used because researchers recognize that alternative hypotheses may also be consistent with the observations.
"In this sense, a hypothesis can never be proven, but rather only supported by surviving rounds of scientific testing and, eventually, becoming widely thought of as true."
"A useful hypothesis allows prediction and within the accuracy of observation of the time, the prediction will be verified."
"As the accuracy of observation improves with time, the hypothesis may no longer provide an accurate prediction."
"In this case, a new hypothesis will arise to challenge the old, and to the extent that the new hypothesis makes more accurate predictions than the old, the new will supplant it."
"Researchers can also use a null hypothesis, which states no relationship or difference between the independent or dependent variables."
"There are various history guidelines that are commonly used by historians in their work, under the headings of external criticism, internal criticism, and synthesis."
This includes lower criticism and sensual criticism.
One of the characteristics of artistic research is that it must accept subjectivity as opposed to the classical scientific methods.
"It is based on artistic practices, methods, and criticality."
"Through presented documentation, the insights gained shall be placed in a context."""
Artistic research aims to enhance knowledge and understanding with presentation of the arts.
A simpler understanding by Julian Klein defines artistic research as any kind of research employing the artistic mode of perception.
"Most writers, whether of fiction or non-fiction books, also have to do research to support their creative work."
"This may be factual, historical, or background research."
"The Florence Principles relating to the Salzburg Principles and the Salzburg Recommendations of EUA (European University Association) name seven points of attention to specify the Doctorate / PhD in the Arts compared to a scientific doctorate / PhD The Florence Principles have been endorsed and are supported also by AEC, CILECT, CUMULUS and SAR."
"The hourglass model starts with a broad spectrum for research, focusing in on the required information through the method of the project (like the neck of the hourglass), then expands the research in the form of discussion and results."
"Most research begins with a general statement of the problem, or rather, the purpose for engaging in the study."
The literature review identifies flaws or holes in previous research which provides justification for the study.
"Often, a literature review is conducted in a given subject area before a research question is identified."
"A gap in the current literature, as identified by a researcher, then engenders a research question."
The research question may be parallel to the hypothesis.
The hypothesis is the supposition to be tested.
The results of the data analysis in rejecting or failing to reject the null hypothesis are then reported and evaluated.
"At the end, the researcher may discuss avenues for further research."
"However, some researchers advocate for the reverse approach: starting with articulating findings and discussion of them, moving ""up"" to identification of a research problem that emerges in the findings and literature review."
"The reverse approach is justified by the transactional nature of the research endeavor where research inquiry, research questions, research method, relevant research literature, and so on are not fully known until the findings have fully emerged and been interpreted."
"It is only when a range of tests are consistent over many kinds of data, researchers, and methods can one have confidence in the results."
"that is analyzed, and searching for themes."
This type of research aims to investigate a question without attempting to quantifiably measure variables or look to potential relationships between variables.
It is viewed as more restrictive in testing hypotheses because it can be expensive and time-consuming and typically limited to a single set of research subjects.
Qualitative research is often used as a method of exploratory research as a basis for later quantitative research hypotheses.
"The quantitative research designs are experimental, correlational, and survey (or descriptive)."
Statistics derived from quantitative research can be used to establish the existence of associative or causal relationships between variables.
"These methods produce results that can be summarized, compared, and generalized to larger populations if the data are collected using proper sampling and data collection strategies."
"If this is not feasible, the researcher may collect data on participant and situational characteristics to statistically control for their influence on the dependent, or outcome, variable."
"Primary data is data collected specifically for the research, such as through interviews or questionnaires."
"Secondary data is data that already exists, such as census data, which can be re-used for the research."
"research that includes qualitative and quantitative elements, using both primary and secondary data, is becoming more common."
This method has benefits that using one method alone cannot offer.
"As such, non-empirical research seeks solutions to problems using existing knowledge as its source."
"This, however, does not mean that new ideas and innovations cannot be found within the pool of existing and established knowledge."
Non-empirical research is not an absolute alternative to empirical research because they may be used together to strengthen a research approach.
Neither one is less effective than the other since they have their particular purpose in science.
"Typically empirical research produces observations that need to be explained; then theoretical research tries to explain them, and in so doing generates empirically testable hypotheses; these hypotheses are then tested empirically, giving more observations that may need further explanation; and so on."
A simple example of a non-empirical task is the prototyping of a new drug using a differentiated application of existing knowledge; another is the development of a business process in the form of a flow chart and texts where all the ingredients are from established knowledge.
Much of cosmological research is theoretical in nature.
"Mathematics research does not rely on externally available data; rather, it seeks to prove theorems about mathematical objects."
"Historically, the revelation of scandals such as Nazi human experimentation and the Tuskegee syphilis experiment led to the realisation that clear measures are needed for the ethical governance of research to ensure that people, animals and environments are not unduly harmed in research."
The management of research ethics is inconsistent across countries and there is no universally accepted approach to how it should be addressed.
Informed consent is a key concept in research ethics.
"When making ethical decisions, we may be guided by different things and philosophers commonly distinguish between approaches like deontology, consequentialism, virtue ethics and value (ethics)."
"Regardless of approach, the application of ethical theory to specific controversial topics is known as applied ethics and research ethics can be viewed as a form of applied ethics because ethical theory is applied in real-world research scenarios."
Ethical issues may arise in the design and implementation of research involving human experimentation or animal experimentation.
"There may also be consequences for the environment, for society or for future generations that need to be considered."
"Also known as ""research on research"", it aims to reduce waste and increase the quality of research in all fields."
"Meta-research concerns itself with the detection of bias, methodological flaws, and other errors and inefficiencies."
Among the finding of meta-research is a low rates of reproducibility across a large number of fields.
"This widespread difficulty in reproducing research has been termed the ""replication crisis."""
Researchers are overwhelmingly taught Western methods of data collection and study.
The increasing participation of indigenous peoples as researchers has brought increased attention to the scientific lacuna in culturally-sensitive methods of data collection.
Western methods of data collection may not be the most accurate or relevant for research on non-Western societies.
"For example, ""Hua Oranga"" was created as a criterion for psychological evaluation in Māori populations, and is based on dimensions of mental health important to the Māori people – ""taha wairua (the spiritual dimension), taha hinengaro (the mental dimension), taha tinana (the physical dimension), and taha whanau (the family dimension)""."
Periphery scholars face the challenges of exclusion and linguicism in research and academic publication.
"As the great majority of mainstream academic journals are written in English, multilingual periphery scholars often must translate their work to be accepted to elite Western-dominated journals."
"Since 2000, Latin American countries have become more popular in single-country studies."
"In contrast, countries in Oceania and the Caribbean are the focus of very few studies."
Patterns of geographic bias also show a relationship with linguicism: countries whose official languages are French or Arabic are far less likely to be the focus of single-country studies than countries with different official languages.
"Within Africa, English-speaking countries are more represented than other countries."
"Studies with a narrow scope can result in a lack of generalizability, meaning that the results may not be applicable to other populations or regions."
"In comparative politics, this can result from using a single-country study, rather than a study design that uses data from multiple countries."
"Despite the issue of generalizability, single-country studies have risen in prevalence since the late 2000s."
"Peer review methods are employed to maintain standards of quality, improve performance, and provide credibility."
"In academia, scholarly peer review is often used to determine an academic paper's suitability for publication."
"Usually, the peer review process involves experts in the same field who are consulted by editors to give a review of the scholarly works produced by a colleague of theirs from an unbiased and impartial point of view, and this is usually done free of charge."
The tradition of peer reviews being done for free has however brought many pitfalls which are also indicative of why most peer reviewers decline many invitations to review.
"It was observed that publications from periphery countries rarely rise to the same elite status as those of North America and Europe, because limitations on the availability of resources including high-quality paper and sophisticated image-rendering software and printing tools render these publications less able to satisfy standards currently carrying formal or informal authority in the publishing industry."
"These limitations in turn result in the under-representation of scholars from periphery nations among the set of publications holding prestige status relative to the quantity and quality of those scholars' research efforts, and this under-representation in turn results in disproportionately reduced acceptance of the results of their efforts as contributions to the body of knowledge available worldwide."
This idea gained prevalence as a result of Western colonial history and ignores alternative conceptions of knowledge circulation.
"indigenous communities) this is denounced as ""access control"" and reprehended as censorship."
Marginson argues that the East Asian Confucian model could take over the Western model.
This could be due to changes in funding for research both in the East and the West.
"Focussed on emphasizing educational achievement, East Asian cultures, mainly in China and South Korea, have encouraged the increase of funding for research expansion."
"In contrast, in the Western academic world, notably in the United Kingdom as well as in some state governments in the United States, funding cuts for university research have occurred, which some say may lead to the future decline of Western dominance in research."
"The system varies widely by field and is also always changing, if often slowly."
Most academic work is published in journal article or book form.
There is also a large body of research that exists in either a thesis or dissertation form.
These forms of research can be found in databases explicitly for theses and dissertations.
"In publishing, STM publishing is an abbreviation for academic publications in science, technology, and medicine."
"Most established academic fields have their own scientific journals and other outlets for publication, though many academic journals are somewhat interdisciplinary, and publish work from several distinct fields or subfields."
"The kinds of publications that are accepted as contributions of knowledge or research vary greatly between fields, from the print to the electronic format."
A study suggests that researchers should not give great consideration to findings that are not replicated frequently.
It has also been suggested that all published studies should be subjected to some measure for assessing the validity or reliability of its procedures to prevent the publication of unproven findings.
Business models are different in the electronic environment.
"Since about the early 1990s, licensing of electronic resources, particularly journals, has been very common."
"Presently, a major trend, particularly with respect to scholarly journals, is open access."
"There are two main forms of open access: open access publishing, in which the articles or the whole journal is freely available from the time of publication, and self-archiving, where the author makes a copy of their own work freely available on the web."
These are managed primarily through universities and in some cases through military contractors.
"Time is the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, into the future."
"It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events or the intervals between them, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience."
"Examples of events are the collision or two particles, the explosion of a supernova, or the arrival of a rocket ship."
Every event can be assigned four numbers representing its time and position (the event's coordinates).
"However, the numerical values are different for different observers."
"In general relativity, the question of what time it is now only has meaning relative to a particular observer."
"Distance and time are intimately related and the time required for light to travel a specific distance is the same for all observers, as first publicly demonstrated by Michelson and Morley."
General relativity does not address the nature of time for extremely small intervals where quantum mechanics holds.
"At this time, there is no generally accepted theory of quantum general relativity."
Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units (SI) and International System of Quantities.
Time is used to define other quantities – such as velocity – so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition.
"An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life."
"To describe observations of an event, a location (position in space) and time are typically noted."
The operational definition of time does not address what the fundamental nature of it is.
"It does not address why events can happen forward and backwards in space, whereas events only happen in the forward progress of time."
Investigations into the relationship between space and time led physicists to define the spacetime continuum.
General relativity is the primary framework for understanding how spacetime works.
"Through advances in both theoretical and experimental investigations of space-time, it has been shown that time can be distorted and dilated, particularly at the edges of black holes."
"Temporal measurement has occupied scientists and technologists, and was a prime motivation in navigation and astronomy."
Periodic events and periodic motion have long served as standards for units of time.
"Examples include the apparent motion of the sun across the sky, the phases of the moon, the swing of a pendulum, and the beat of a heart."
"Currently, the international unit of time, the second, is defined by measuring the electronic transition frequency of caesium atoms (see below)."
"Time is also of significant social importance, having economic value (""time is money"") as well as personal value, due to an awareness of the limited time in each day and in human life spans."
"There are many systems for determining what time it is, including the Global Positioning System, other satellite systems, Coordinated Universal Time and mean solar time."
"In general, the numbers obtained from different time systems differ from one another."
"In day-to-day life, the clock is consulted for periods less than a day whereas the calendar is consulted for periods longer than a day."
"Increasingly, personal electronic devices display both calendars and clocks simultaneously."
The number (as on a clock dial or calendar) that marks the occurrence of a specified event as to hour or date is obtained by counting from a fiducial epoch – a central reference point.
"Without intercalation to add days or months to some years, seasons quickly drift in a calendar based solely on twelve lunar months."
"The numbers twelve and thirteen came to feature prominently in many cultures, at least partly due to this relationship of months to years."
"Other early forms of calendars originated in Mesoamerica, particularly in ancient Mayan civilization."
This Julian calendar was faulty in that its intercalation still allowed the astronomical solstices and equinoxes to advance against it by about 11 minutes per year.
"Pope Gregory XIII introduced a correction in 1582; the Gregorian calendar was only slowly adopted by different nations over a period of centuries, but it is now by far the most commonly used calendar around the world."
"During the French Revolution, a new clock and calendar were invented in an attempt to de-Christianize time and create a more rational system in order to replace the Gregorian calendar."
"The French Republican Calendar's days consisted of ten hours of a hundred minutes of a hundred seconds, which marked a deviation from the base 12 (duodecimal) system used in many other devices by many cultures."
The T was oriented eastward in the mornings.
The position of the shadow marks the hour in local time.
"The idea to separate the day into smaller parts is credited to Egyptians because of their sundials, which operated on a duodecimal system."
"They could be used to measure the hours even at night, but required manual upkeep to replenish the flow of water."
The ancient Greeks and the people from Chaldea (southeastern Mesopotamia) regularly maintained timekeeping records as an essential part of their astronomical observations.
Arab inventors and engineers in particular made improvements on the use of water clocks up to the Middle Ages.
"In the 11th century, Chinese inventors and engineers invented the first mechanical clocks driven by an escapement mechanism."
The hourglass uses the flow of sand to measure the flow of time.
They were used in navigation.
"Waterclocks, and later, mechanical clocks, were used to mark the events of the abbeys and monasteries of the Middle Ages."
"The passage of the hours at sea were marked by bells, and denoted the time (see ship's bell)."
The hours were marked by bells in abbeys as well as at sea.
"Clocks can range from watches, to more exotic varieties such as the Clock of the Long Now."
"They can be driven by a variety of means, including gravity, springs, and various forms of electrical power, and regulated by a variety of means such as a pendulum."
Alarm clocks first appeared in ancient Greece around 250 BC with a water clock that would set off a whistle.
"Initially, the term was used to refer to the marine chronometer, a timepiece used to determine longitude by means of celestial navigation, a precision firstly achieved by John Harrison."
"More recently, the term has also been applied to the chronometer watch, a watch that meets precision standards set by the Swiss agency COSC."
"The most accurate timekeeping devices are atomic clocks, which are accurate to seconds in many millions of years, and are used to calibrate other clocks and timekeeping instruments."
Atomic clocks use the frequency of electronic transitions in certain atoms to measure the second.
"One of the atoms used is caesium, most modern atomic clocks probe caesium with microwaves to determine the frequency of these electron vibrations."
"Since 1967, the International System of Measurements bases its unit of time, the second, on the properties of caesium atoms."
"Today, the Global Positioning System in coordination with the Network Time Protocol can be used to synchronize timekeeping systems across the globe."
"In medieval philosophical writings, the atom was a unit of time referred to as the smallest possible division of time."
"The earliest known occurrence in English is in Byrhtferth's Enchiridion (a science text) of 1010–1012, where it was defined as 1/564 of a momentum (1½ minutes), and thus equal to 15/94 of a second."
"It was used in the computus, the process of calculating the date of Easter."
"A minute (min) is 60 seconds in length, and an hour is 60 minutes or 3600 seconds in length."
"A day is usually 24 hours or 86,400 seconds in length; however, the duration of a calendar day can vary due to Daylight saving time and Leap seconds."
The local meridian is an imaginary line that runs from celestial north pole to celestial south pole passing directly over the head of the observer.
At the local meridian the Sun reaches its highest point on its daily arc across the sky.
"In 1874 the British Association for the Advancement of Science introduced the CGS (centimetre/gramme/second system) combining fundamental units of length, mass and time."
"The second is ""elastic"", because tidal friction is slowing the earth's rotation rate."
The CGS system has been superseded by the Système international.
The SI base unit for time is the SI second.
"The International System of Quantities, which incorporates the SI, also defines larger units of time equal to fixed integer multiples of one second (1 s), such as the minute, hour and day."
"These are not part of the SI, but may be used alongside the SI."
"The definition of the second in mean solar time, however, is unchanged."
"The timescale adopted was Greenwich Mean Time, created in 1847."
"A few countries have replaced it with Coordinated Universal Time, UTC."
"In 1847 in Britain, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) was first created for use by the British railways, the British navy, and the British shipping industry."
"Using telescopes, GMT was calibrated to the mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in the UK."
"As international commerce continued to increase throughout Europe, in order to achieve a more efficiently functioning modern society, an agreed upon, and highly accurate international standard of time measurement became necessary."
This new time-standard then had to be consistently and accurately measured.
"At this conference, the local mean solar time at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich in England was chosen to define the ""universal day"", counted from 0 hours at Greenwich mean midnight."
This agreed with the civil Greenwich Mean Time used on the island of Great Britain since 1847.
astronomical day X began at noon of civil day X.
The purpose of this was to keep one night's observations under one date.
The civil system was adopted as of 0 hours (civil) 1 January 1925.
"Nautical GMT began 24 hours before astronomical GMT, at least until 1805 in the Royal Navy, but persisted much later elsewhere because it was mentioned at the 1884 conference."
In 1928 Greenwich Mean Time was rebranded for scientific purposes by the International Astronomical Union as Universal Time (UT).
This was to avoid confusion with the previous system in which the day had begun at noon.
"As the general public had always begun the day at midnight, the timescale continued to be presented to them as Greenwich Mean Time."
"By 1956, universal time had been split into various versions: UT2, which smoothed for polar motion and seasonal effects, was presented to the public as Greenwich Mean Time."
"Later, UT1 (which smooths only for polar motion) became the default form of UT used by astronomers and hence the form used in navigation, sunrise and sunset and moonrise and moonset tables where the name Greenwich Mean Time continues to be employed."
Greenwich Mean Time is also the preferred method of describing the timescale used by legislators.
"Even to the present day, UT is still based on an international telescopic system."
"Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system."
"Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT, where the second is defined as 1/86 400 of the mean solar day."
"Until 1960, the methods and definitions of time-keeping that had been laid out at the International Meridian Conference proved to be adequate to meet time tracking needs of science."
"Still, with the advent of the ""electronic revolution"" in the latter half of the 20th century, the technologies that had been available at the time of the Convention of the Metre proved to be in need of further refinement in order to meet the needs of the ever-increasing precision that the ""electronic revolution"" had begun to require."
"In 1960 this ephemeris second was made the basis of the ""coordinated universal time"" which was being derived from atomic clocks."
"It is a specified fraction of the mean tropical year as at 1900 and, being based on historical telescope observations, corresponds roughly to the mean solar second of the early nineteenth century."
The SI second (Standard Internationale second) is based directly on the measurement of the atomic-clock observation of the frequency oscillation of caesium atoms.
"coordinated universal time, GPS time, International Atomic Time, etc."
Atomic clocks do not measure nuclear decay rates (a common misconception) but rather measure a certain natural vibrational frequency of caesium-133.
Coordinated universal time is subject to one constraint which does not affect the other atomic timescales.
This is achieved by the occasional insertion of a leap second.
"Australia, Canada (Quebec only), Colombia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea (Bougainville only), Paraguay, Portugal, Switzerland, the United States and Venezuela use UTC."
"However, UTC is widely used by the scientific community in countries where mean solar time is official."
"UTC time is based on the SI second, which was first defined in 1967, and is based on the use of atomic clocks."
"Some other less used but closely related time-standards include International Atomic Time (TAI), Terrestrial Time, and Barycentric Dynamical Time."
"Between 1967 and 1971, UTC was periodically adjusted by fractional amounts of a second in order to adjust and refine for variations in mean solar time, with which it is aligned."
"After 1 January 1972, UTC time has been defined as being offset from atomic time by a whole number of seconds, changing only when a leap second is added to keep radio-controlled clocks synchronized with the rotation of the Earth."
"The Global Positioning System also broadcasts a very precise time signal worldwide, along with instructions for converting GPS time to UTC."
"GPS-time is based on, and regularly synchronized with or from, UTC-time."
The surface of the Earth is split up into a number of time zones.
"Most time zones are exactly one hour apart, and by convention compute their local time as an offset from GMT."
"For example, time zones at sea are based on GMT."
In many locations (but not at sea) these offsets vary twice yearly due to daylight saving time transitions.
"In astronomy, sidereal time is used to predict when a star will reach its highest point in the sky."
"Due to Earth's orbital motion around the Sun, a mean solar day is about 3 minutes 56 seconds longer than a mean sidereal day, or ​1⁄366 more than a mean sidereal day."
"Events in the past can be ordered in a sequence (creating a chronology), and can be put into chronological groups (periodization)."
"One of the most important systems of periodization is the geologic time scale, which is a system of periodizing the events that shaped the Earth and its life."
"The former refers to numeric, or chronological, time."
"The latter, literally ""the right or opportune moment"", relates specifically to metaphysical or Divine time."
"His name in Greek means ""time"" and is alternatively spelled Chronus (Latin spelling) or Khronos."
"Chronos is usually portrayed as an old, wise man with a long, gray beard, such as ""Father Time""."
"Some English words whose etymological root is khronos/chronos include chronology, chronometer, chronic, anachronism, synchronise, and chronicle."
Both the future and the past are recognised to be combined and simultaneously present.
"One view is that time is part of the fundamental structure of the universe – a dimension independent of events, in which events occur in sequence."
"Isaac Newton subscribed to this realist view, and hence it is sometimes referred to as Newtonian time."
"The opposing view is that time does not refer to any kind of ""container"" that events and objects ""move through"", nor to any entity that ""flows"", but that it is instead part of a fundamental intellectual structure (together with space and number) within which humans sequence and compare events."
"This second view, in the tradition of Gottfried Leibniz and Immanuel Kant, holds that time is neither an event nor a thing, and thus is not itself measurable nor can it be travelled."
Ancient Greek philosophers asked if time was linear or cyclical and if time was endless or finite.
"These philosophers had different ways of explaining time; for instance, ancient Indian philosophers had something called the Wheel of Time."
It is believed that there was repeating ages over the lifespan of the universe.
This led to beliefs like cycles of rebirth and reincarnation.
"The Greek philosophers believe that the universe was infinite, and was an illusion to humans."
Plato believed that time was made by the Creator at the same instant as the heavens.
He also says that time is a period of motion of the heavenly bodies.
"Aristotle believed that time correlated to movement, that time did not exist on its own but was relative to motion of objects."
"If no one asks me, I know: if I wish to explain it to one that asketh, I know not."""
Isaac Newton believed in absolute space and absolute time; Leibniz believed that time and space are relational.
The differences between Leibniz's and Newton's interpretations came to a head in the famous Leibniz–Clarke correspondence.
"Philosophers in the 17th and 18th century questioned if time was real and absolute, or if it was an intellectual concept that humans use to understand and sequence events."
"These questions lead to realism vs anti-realism; the realists believed that time is a fundamental part of the universe, and be perceived by events happening in a sequence, in a dimension."
"Isaac Newton said that we are merely occupying time, he also says that humans can only understand relative time."
Relative time is a measurement of objects in motion.
The anti-realists believed that time is merely a convenient intellectual concept for humans to understand events.
"This means that time was useless unless there were objects that it could interact with, this was called relational time."
"René Descartes, John Locke, and David Hume said that one's mind needs to acknowledge time, in order to understand what time is."
Immanuel Kant believed that we can not know what something is unless we experience it first hand.
"Immanuel Kant, in the Critique of Pure Reason, described time as an a priori intuition that allows us (together with the other a priori intuition, space) to comprehend sense experience."
"With Kant, neither space nor time are conceived as substances, but rather both are elements of a systematic mental framework that necessarily structures the experiences of any rational agent, or observing subject."
"Kant thought of time as a fundamental part of an abstract conceptual framework, together with space and number, within which we sequence events, quantify their duration, and compare the motions of objects."
"In this view, time does not refer to any kind of entity that ""flows,"" that objects ""move through,"" or that is a ""container"" for events."
"Spatial measurements are used to quantify the extent of and distances between objects, and temporal measurements are used to quantify the durations of and between events."
Time was designated by Kant as the purest possible schema of a pure concept or category.
"Henri Bergson believed that time was neither a real homogeneous medium nor a mental construct, but possesses what he referred to as Duration."
"Hence, the relationship to the past is a present awareness of having been, which allows the past to exist in the present."
"The relationship to the future is the state of anticipating a potential possibility, task, or engagement."
"It is related to the human propensity for caring and being concerned, which causes ""being ahead of oneself"" when thinking of a pending occurrence."
"Therefore, this concern for a potential occurrence also allows the future to exist in the present."
"The present becomes an experience, which is qualitative instead of quantitative."
"Heidegger seems to think this is the way that a linear relationship with time, or temporal existence, is broken or transcended."
We are not stuck in sequential time.
"We are able to remember the past and project into the future – we have a kind of random access to our representation of temporal existence; we can, in our thoughts, step out of (ecstasis) sequential time.Modern era philosophers asked: is time real or unreal, is time happening all at once or a duration, If time tensed or tenseless, and is there a future to be?"
There is a theory called the tenseless or B-theory; this theory says that any tensed terminology can be replaced with tenseless terminology.
"For example, ""we will win the game"" can be replaced with ""we do win the game"", taking out the future tense."
"On the other hand, there is a theory called the tense or A-theory; this theory says that our language has tense verbs for a reason and that the future can not be determined."
"There is also something called imaginary time, this was from Stephen Hawking, he says that space and imaginary time are finite but have no boundaries."
"Imaginary time is not real or unreal, it is something that is hard to visualize."
"Philosophers can agree that physical time exists outside of the human mind and is objective, and psychological time is mind dependent and subjective."
"Parmenides went further, maintaining that time, motion, and change were illusions, leading to the paradoxes of his follower Zeno."
These arguments often center on what it means for something to be unreal.
"This theory rejects the existence of all direct interaction with the past or the future, holding only the present as tangible."
This is one of the philosophical arguments against time travel.
"This contrasts with eternalism (all time: present, past and future, is real) and the growing block theory (the present and the past are real, but the future is not)."
Non-relativistic classical mechanics is based on this Newtonian idea of time.
"He showed that this postulate, together with a reasonable definition for what it means for two events to be simultaneous, requires that distances appear compressed and time intervals appear lengthened for events associated with objects in motion relative to an inertial observer."
"The theory of special relativity finds a convenient formulation in Minkowski spacetime, a mathematical structure that combines three dimensions of space with a single dimension of time."
"Two events in Minkowski spacetime are separated by an invariant interval, which can be either space-like, light-like, or time-like."
"Events that have a time-like separation cannot be simultaneous in any frame of reference, there must be a temporal component (and possibly a spatial one) to their separation."
"Events that have a space-like separation will be simultaneous in some frame of reference, and there is no frame of reference in which they do not have a spatial separation."
"Different observers may calculate different distances and different time intervals between two events, but the invariant interval between the events is independent of the observer (and his or her velocity)."
Events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people's experience.
"In the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism."
"Einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity."
This led directly to the conclusion that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.
"According to these theories, the concept of time depends on the spatial reference frame of the observer, and the human perception as well as the measurement by instruments such as clocks are different for observers in relative motion."
"For example, if a spaceship carrying a clock flies through space at (very nearly) the speed of light, its crew does not notice a change in the speed of time on board their vessel because everything traveling at the same speed slows down at the same rate (including the clock, the crew's thought processes, and the functions of their bodies)."
"However, to a stationary observer watching the spaceship fly by, the spaceship appears flattened in the direction it is traveling and the clock on board the spaceship appears to move very slowly."
"On the other hand, the crew on board the spaceship also perceives the observer as slowed down and flattened along the spaceship's direction of travel, because both are moving at very nearly the speed of light relative to each other."
"Because the outside universe appears flattened to the spaceship, the crew perceives themselves as quickly traveling between regions of space that (to the stationary observer) are many light years apart."
This is reconciled by the fact that the crew's perception of time is different from the stationary observer's; what seems like seconds to the crew might be hundreds of years to the stationary observer.
"In either case, however, causality remains unchanged: the past is the set of events that can send light signals to an entity and the future is the set of events to which an entity can send light signals."
"Though these effects are typically minute in the human experience, the effect becomes much more pronounced for objects moving at speeds approaching the speed of light."
"Subatomic particles exist for a well known average fraction of a second in a lab relatively at rest, but when travelling close to the speed of light they are measured to travel farther and exist for much longer than when at rest."
"According to the special theory of relativity, in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists, on the average, for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero, because its velocity is zero."
"Relative to a frame of reference at rest, time seems to ""slow down"" for the particle."
"Relative to the high-speed particle, distances seem to shorten."
"Einstein showed how both temporal and spatial dimensions can be altered (or ""warped"") by high-speed motion."
"Einstein (The Meaning of Relativity): ""Two events taking place at the points A and B of a system K are simultaneous if they appear at the same instant when observed from the middle point, M, of the interval AB."
"Time is then defined as the ensemble of the indications of similar clocks, at rest relative to K, which register the same simultaneously."""
"At the heart of these differences are the Galilean and Lorentz transformations applicable in the Newtonian and relativistic theories, respectively."
"In the figures, the vertical direction indicates time."
"The horizontal direction indicates distance (only one spatial dimension is taken into account), and the thick dashed curve is the spacetime trajectory (""world line"") of the observer."
The small dots indicate specific (past and future) events in spacetime.
The slope of the world line (deviation from being vertical) gives the relative velocity to the observer.
Note how in both pictures the view of spacetime changes when the observer accelerates.
"However, in the relativistic description the observability of events is absolute: the movements of the observer do not influence whether an event passes the ""light cone"" of the observer."
"Notice that with the change from a Newtonian to a relativistic description, the concept of absolute time is no longer applicable: events move up-and-down in the figure depending on the acceleration of the observer."
"Yet for the most part the laws of physics do not specify an arrow of time, and allow any process to proceed both forward and in reverse."
"This is generally a consequence of time being modelled by a parameter in the system being analysed, where there is no ""proper time"": the direction of the arrow of time is sometimes arbitrary."
"Examples of this include the cosmological arrow of time, which points away from the Big Bang, CPT symmetry, and the radiative arrow of time, caused by light only travelling forwards in time (see light cone)."
"In particle physics, the violation of CP symmetry implies that there should be a small counterbalancing time asymmetry to preserve CPT symmetry as stated above."
The standard description of measurement in quantum mechanics is also time asymmetric (see Measurement in quantum mechanics).
The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy must increase over time (see Entropy).
"This can be in either direction – Brian Greene theorizes that, according to the equations, the change in entropy occurs symmetrically whether going forward or backward in time."
"So entropy tends to increase in either direction, and our current low-entropy universe is a statistical aberration, in the similar manner as tossing a coin often enough that eventually heads will result ten times in a row."
"However, this theory is not supported empirically in local experiment."
In the modern established physical theories (the Standard Model of Particles and Interactions and General Relativity) time is not quantized.
"Current established physical theories are believed to fail at this time scale, and many physicists expect that the Planck time might be the smallest unit of time that could ever be measured, even in principle."
Tentative physical theories that describe this time scale exist; see for instance loop quantum gravity.
"In this view, all points in time (including future times) ""persist"" in some way."
Time travel has been a plot device in fiction since the 19th century.
"Travelling backwards in time has never been verified, presents many theoretical problems, and may be an impossibility."
"Any technological device, whether fictional or hypothetical, that is used to achieve time travel is known as a time machine."
"A central problem with time travel to the past is the violation of causality; should an effect precede its cause, it would give rise to the possibility of a temporal paradox."
"Some interpretations of time travel resolve this by accepting the possibility of travel between branch points, parallel realities, or universes."
Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen.
"As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined."
"As such, it would not be possible to enact the grandfather paradox because it is a historical fact that one's grandfather was not killed before his child (one's parent) was conceived."
"This view does not simply hold that history is an unchangeable constant, but that any change made by a hypothetical future time traveller would already have happened in his or her past, resulting in the reality that the traveller moves from."
More elaboration on this view can be found in the Novikov self-consistency principle.
"The experienced present is said to be 'specious' in that, unlike the objective present, it is an interval and not a durationless instant."
"Clay, and later developed by William James."
"One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nuclei, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping."
Psychoactive drugs can impair the judgment of time.
"Stimulants can lead both humans and rats to overestimate time intervals, while depressants can have the opposite effect."
The level of activity in the brain of neurotransmitters such as dopamine and norepinephrine may be the reason for this.
"Two- and three-year-olds' understanding of time is mainly limited to ""now and not now""."
"Five- and six-year-olds can grasp the ideas of past, present, and future."
Seven- to ten-year-olds can use clocks and calendars.
The sense of time is impaired in some people with neurological diseases such as Parkinson's disease and attention deficit disorder.
"Psychologists assert that time seems to go faster with age, but the literature on this age-related perception of time remains controversial."
"Those who support this notion argue that young people, having more excitatory neurotransmitters, are able to cope with faster external events."
Arlie Russell Hochschild and Norbert Elias have written on the use of time from a sociological perspective.
"The use of time is an important issue in understanding human behavior, education, and travel behavior."
Time-use research is a developing field of study.
"Time use changes with technology, as the television or the Internet created new opportunities to use time in different ways."
"However, some aspects of time use are relatively stable over long periods of time, such as the amount of time spent traveling to work, which despite major changes in transport, has been observed to be about 20–30 minutes one-way for a large number of cities over a long period."
"Time management is the organization of tasks or events by first estimating how much time a task requires and when it must be completed, and adjusting events that would interfere with its completion so it is done in the appropriate amount of time."
Calendars and day planners are common examples of time management tools.
"Because of causality, cause precedes effect, or cause and effect may appear together in a single item, but effect never precedes cause."
"A sequence of events can be presented in text, tables, charts, or timelines."
The description of the items or events may include a timestamp.
A sequence of events that includes the time along with place or location information to describe a sequential path may be referred to as a world line.
A specific example of a sequence of events is the timeline of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster.
"That is, instead of thinking about time in a general, abstract way, humans think about time in a spatial way and mentally organize it as such."
Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal events in a specific way.
This spatial representation of time is often represented in the mind as a Mental Time Line (MTL).
Using space to think about time allows humans to mentally organize temporal order.
"These origins are shaped by many environmental factors––for example, literacy appears to play a large role in the different types of MTLs, as reading/writing direction provides an everyday temporal orientation that differs from culture to culture."
"In western cultures, the MTL may unfold rightward (with the past on the left and the future on the right) since people read and write from left to right."
Western calendars also continue this trend by placing the past on the left with the future progressing toward the right.
"So, although Western cultures typically associate past events with the left and future events with the right according to a certain MTL, this kind of horizontal, egocentric MTL is not the spatial organization of all cultures."
"The Russian Revolution was a period of political and social revolution across the territory of the Russian Empire, commencing with the abolition of the monarchy in 1917 and concluding in 1923 with the Bolshevik establishment of the Soviet Union at the end of the Civil War."
"It began during the First World War, with the February Revolution that was focused in and around the then-capital, Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg)."
"The revolution erupted in the context of Russia's major military losses during the war, which resulted in much of the Russian Army being ready to mutiny."
"In the chaos, members of the Duma, Russia's parliament, assumed control of the country, forming the Russian Provisional Government."
This was dominated by the interests of large capitalists and the Russian nobility and aristocracy.
"The army leadership felt they did not have the means to suppress the revolution, and Emperor Nicholas II abdicated his throne."
"Grassroots community assemblies called ""Soviets"", which were dominated by soldiers and the urban industrial proletariat, initially permitted the Provisional Government to rule but insisted on a prerogative to influence the government and control various militias."
"A period of dual power ensued, during which the Provisional Government held state power while the national network of Soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class."
"During this chaotic period, there were frequent mutinies, protests and strikes."
"Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the Soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks (""Ones of the Majority"") led by Vladimir Lenin."
"He campaigned for an immediate end of Russia's participation in the war, granting land to the peasants, and providing bread to the urban workers."
"When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions exploited the virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further."
They soon relocated the national capital to Moscow.
"The Bolsheviks had secured a strong base of support within the Soviets and, as the supreme governing party, established a federal government dedicated to reorganizing the former empire into the world's first socialist state, to practice soviet democracy on a national and international scale."
Their promise to end Russia's participation in the First World War was fulfilled when the Bolshevik leaders signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with Germany in March 1918.
"To further secure the new state, the Bolsheviks established the Cheka, a secret police that functioned as a revolutionary security service to weed out, execute, or punish those considered to be ""enemies of the people"" in campaigns consciously modeled on those of the French Revolution."
"Soon after, civil war erupted among the ""Reds"" (Bolsheviks), the ""Whites"" (counter-revolutionaries), the independence movements, and other socialist factions opposed to the Bolsheviks."
"It continued for several years, during which the Bolsheviks defeated both the Whites and all rival socialists."
"Victorious, they reconstituted themselves as the Communist Party."
"They also established Soviet power in the newly independent republics of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia and Ukraine."
They brought these jurisdictions into unification under the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) in 1922.
"While many notable historical events occurred in Moscow and Petrograd, there were also major changes in cities throughout the state, and among national minorities throughout the empire and in the rural areas, where peasants took over and redistributed land."
The events of Bloody Sunday triggered nationwide protests and soldier mutinies.
A short wave of patriotic nationalism ended in the face of defeats and poor conditions on the Eastern Front of World War I.
"The Tsar made the situation  worse by taking personal control of the Imperial Russian Army in 1915, a challenge far beyond his skills."
He was now held personally responsible for Russia's continuing defeats and losses.
"In addition, Tsarina Alexandra, left to rule in while the Tsar commanded at the front, was German born, leading to suspicion of collusion, only to be exacerbated by rumors relating to her relationship with the controversial mystic Grigori Rasputin."
"This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture."
"Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not lie in any failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime."
"The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, printed millions of ruble notes, and by 1917, inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914."
"Farmers were consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but with little increase in income."
"As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming."
Thus the cities were constantly short of food.
"At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916, revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes."
"This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation of workers in revolutionary parties."
"Liberal parties too had an increased platform to voice their complaints, as the initial fervor of the war resulted in the Tsarist government creating a variety of political organizations."
"In July 1915, a Central War Industries Committee was established under the chairmanship of a prominent Octobrist, Alexander Guchkov (1862–1936), including ten workers' representatives."
The Petrograd Mensheviks agreed to join despite the objections of their leaders abroad.
"Early in 1916, Guchkov discussed with senior army officers and members of the Central War Industries Committee about a possible coup to force the abdication of the Tsar."
"In December, a small group of nobles assassinated Rasputin, and in January 1917 the Tsar's cousin, Grand Duke Nicholas, was asked indirectly by Prince Lvov whether he would be prepared to take over the throne from his nephew, Tsar Nicholas II."
French and German Social Democrats had voted in favour of their respective governments' war efforts.
"Georgi Plekhanov in Paris had adopted a violently anti-German stand, while Alexander Parvus supported the German war effort as the best means of ensuring a revolution in Russia."
"Inevitably Vladimir Lenin, supported by Zinoviev and Radek, strongly contested them."
Their attitudes became known as the Zimmerwald Left.
Lenin rejected both the defence of Russia and the cry for peace.
"Since the autumn of 1914, he had insisted that ""from the standpoint of the working class and of the labouring masses the lesser evil would be the defeat of the Tsarist Monarchy""; the war must be turned into a civil war of the proletarian soldiers against their own governments, and if a proletarian victory should emerge from this in Russia, then their duty would be to wage a revolutionary war for the liberation of the masses throughout Europe."
"At the same time, peasant life and culture was changing constantly."
"At the same time, urban industrial life had its benefits, though these could be just as dangerous (in terms of social and political stability) as the hardships."
There were many encouragements to expect more from life.
"Acquiring new skills gave many workers a sense of self-respect and confidence, heightening expectations and desires."
"Living in cities, workers encountered material goods they had never seen in villages."
"While rural agrarian peasants had been emancipated from serfdom in 1861, they still resented paying redemption payments to the state, and demanded communal tender of the land they worked."
The problem was further compounded by the failure of Sergei Witte's land reforms of the early 20th century.
"Increasing peasant disturbances and sometimes actual revolts occurred, with the goal of securing ownership of the land they worked."
"Between 1890 and 1910, the population of the capital, Saint Petersburg, swelled from 1,033,600 to 1,905,600, with Moscow experiencing similar growth."
"This created a new 'proletariat' which, due to being crowded together in the cities, was much more likely to protest and go on strike than the peasantry had been in previous times."
"In one 1904 survey, it was found that an average of 16 people shared each apartment in Saint Petersburg, with six people per room."
"There was also no running water, and piles of human waste were a threat to the health of the workers."
"The poor conditions only aggravated the situation, with the number of strikes and incidents of public disorder rapidly increasing in the years shortly before World War I."
"Because of late industrialization, Russia's workers were highly concentrated."
World War I added to the chaos.
Conscription across Russia resulted in unwilling citizens being sent off to war.
The vast demand for factory production of war supplies and workers resulted in many more labor riots and strikes.
"Conscription stripped skilled workers from the cities, who had to be replaced with unskilled peasants."
"When famine began to hit due to the poor railway system, workers abandoned the cities in droves seeking food."
"Finally, the soldiers themselves, who suffered from a lack of equipment and protection from the elements, began to turn against the Tsar."
"This was mainly because, as the war progressed, many of the officers who were loyal to the Tsar were killed, being replaced by discontented conscripts from the major cities who had little loyalty to the Tsar."
Nicholas II was a deeply conservative ruler and maintained a strict authoritarian system.
"Individuals and society in general were expected to show self-restraint, devotion to community, deference to the social hierarchy and a sense of duty to the country."
Religious faith helped bind all of these tenets together as a source of comfort and reassurance in the face of difficult conditions and as a means of political authority exercised through the clergy.
"With a firm belief that his power to rule was granted by Divine Right, Nicholas assumed that the Russian people were devoted to him with unquestioning loyalty."
This ironclad belief rendered Nicholas unwilling to allow the progressive reforms that might have alleviated the suffering of the Russian people.
"Since the Age of Enlightenment, Russian intellectuals had promoted Enlightenment ideals such as the dignity of the individual and the rectitude of democratic representation."
"These ideals were championed most vociferously by Russia's liberals, although populists, Marxists, and anarchists also claimed to support democratic reforms."
A growing opposition movement had begun to challenge the Romanov monarchy openly well before the turmoil of World War I.
"Dissatisfaction with Russian autocracy culminated in the huge national upheaval that followed the Bloody Sunday massacre of January 1905, in which hundreds of unarmed protesters were shot by the Tsar's troops."
"Workers responded to the massacre with a crippling general strike, forcing Nicholas to put forth the October Manifesto, which established a democratically elected parliament (the State Duma)."
"Although the Tsar accepted the 1906 Fundamental State Laws one year later, he subsequently dismissed the first two Dumas when they proved uncooperative."
Unfulfilled hopes of democracy fueled revolutionary ideas and violent outbursts targeted at the monarchy.
One of the Tsar's principal rationales for risking war in 1914 was his desire to restore the prestige that Russia had lost amid the debacles of the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905).
Nicholas also sought to foster a greater sense of national unity with a war against a common and old enemy.
The Russian Empire was an agglomeration of diverse ethnicities that had demonstrated significant signs of disunity in the years before the First World War.
"Nicholas believed in part that the shared peril and tribulation of a foreign war would mitigate the social unrest over the persistent issues of poverty, inequality, and inhumane working conditions."
"Instead of restoring Russia's political and military standing, World War I led to the slaughter of Russian troops and military defeats that undermined both the monarchy and Russian society to the point of collapse."
"As the war dragged on inconclusively, war-weariness gradually took its toll."
"However, Austro-Hungarian forces allied to Germany were driven back deep into the Galicia region by the end of the year."
"In the autumn of 1915, Nicholas had taken direct command of the army, personally overseeing Russia's main theatre of war and leaving his ambitious but incapable wife Alexandra in charge of the government."
"Reports of corruption and incompetence in the Imperial government began to emerge, and the growing influence of Grigori Rasputin in the Imperial family was widely resented."
"In 1915, things took a critical turn for the worse when Germany shifted its focus of attack to the Eastern Front."
"The superior German Army – better led, better trained, and better supplied – was quite effective against the ill-equipped Russian forces, driving the Russians out of Galicia, as well as Russian Poland during the Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive campaign."
These staggering losses played a definite role in the mutinies and revolts that began to occur.
"In 1916, reports of fraternizing with the enemy began to circulate."
"Soldiers went hungry, lacked shoes, munitions, and even weapons."
"Rampant discontent lowered morale, which was further undermined by a series of military defeats."
Casualty rates were the most vivid sign of this disaster.
"Far sooner than expected, inadequately trained recruits were called for active duty, a process repeated throughout the war as staggering losses continued to mount."
"The officer class also saw remarkable changes, especially within the lower echelons, which were quickly filled with soldiers rising up through the ranks."
"These men, usually of peasant or working-class backgrounds, were to play a large role in the politicization of the troops in 1917."
"The army quickly ran short of rifles and ammunition (as well as uniforms and food), and by mid-1915, men were being sent to the front bearing no arms."
"It was hoped that they could equip themselves with arms recovered from fallen soldiers, of both sides, on the battlefields."
"The soldiers did not feel as if they were valuable, rather they felt as if they were expendable."
"Russian troops stopped retreating, and there were even some modest successes in the offensives that were staged that year, albeit at great loss of life."
"Also, the problem of shortages was largely solved by a major effort to increase domestic production."
"Nevertheless, by the end of 1916, morale among soldiers was even worse than it had been during the great retreat of 1915."
"The fortunes of war may have improved, but the fact of war remained which continually took Russian lives."
"The crisis in morale (as was argued by Allan Wildman, a leading historian of the Russian army in war and revolution) ""was rooted fundamentally in the feeling of utter despair that the slaughter would ever end and that anything resembling victory could be achieved."
"By the end of 1915, there were manifold signs that the economy was breaking down under the heightened strain of wartime demand."
The main problems were food shortages and rising prices.
"Inflation dragged incomes down at an alarmingly rapid rate, and shortages made it difficult for an individual to sustain oneself."
"Shops closed early or entirely for lack of bread, sugar, meat, and other provisions, and lines lengthened massively for what remained."
Conditions became increasingly difficult to afford food and physically obtain it.
"Strikes increased steadily from the middle of 1915, and so did crime, but, for the most part, people suffered and endured, scouring the city for food."
Government officials responsible for public order worried about how long people's patience would last.
"Tsar Nicholas was blamed for all of these crises, and what little support he had left began to crumble."
"As discontent grew, the State Duma issued a warning to Nicholas in November 1916, stating that, inevitably, a terrible disaster would grip the country unless a constitutional form of government was put in place."
Nicholas ignored these warnings and Russia's Tsarist regime collapsed a few months later during the February Revolution of 1917.
"One year later, the Tsar and his entire family were executed."
"22 February], workers at Putilov, Petrograd's largest industrial plant was closed by a strike."
"The next day, a series of meetings and rallies were held for International Women's Day, which gradually turned into economic and political gatherings."
"Demonstrations were organised to demand bread, and these were supported by the industrial working force who considered them a reason for continuing the strikes."
"The women workers marched to nearby factories bringing out over 50,000 workers on strike."
"25 February], virtually every industrial enterprise in Petrograd had been shut down, together with many commercial and service enterprises."
"At least 180,000 troops were available in the capital, but most were either untrained or injured."
"Historian Ian Beckett suggests around 12,000 could be regarded as reliable, but even these proved reluctant to move in on the crowd, since it included so many women."
"26 February], when the Tsar ordered the army to suppress the rioting by force, troops began to revolt."
"Although few actively joined the rioting, many officers were either shot or went into hiding; the ability of the garrison to hold back the protests was all but nullified, symbols of the Tsarist regime were rapidly torn down around the city, and governmental authority in the capital collapsed – not helped by the fact that Nicholas had prorogued the Duma that morning, leaving it with no legal authority to act."
"The response of the Duma, urged on by the liberal bloc, was to establish a Temporary Committee to restore law and order; meanwhile, the socialist parties established the Petrograd Soviet to represent workers and soldiers."
"1 March], by a group of revolutionaries at Malaya Vishera."
"When the Tsar finally arrived at in Pskov, the Army Chief Nikolai Ruzsky, and the Duma deputies Alexander Guchkov and Vasily Shulgin  suggested in unison that he abdicate the throne."
"2 March], on behalf of himself, and then, having taken advice on behalf of his son, the Tsarevich."
"Nicholas nominated his brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, to succeed him."
"3 March], stating that he would take it only if that was the consensus of democratic action."
"Six days later, Nicholas, no longer Tsar and addressed with contempt by the sentries as ""Nicholas Romanov"", was reunited with his family at the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo."
He was placed under house arrest with his family by the Provisional Government.
The immediate effect of the February Revolution was a widespread atmosphere of elation and excitement in Petrograd.
"3 March], a provisional government was announced."
"The center-left was well represented, and the government was initially chaired by a liberal aristocrat, Prince Georgy Yevgenievich Lvov, a member of the Constitutional Democratic Party (KD)."
"The socialists had formed their rival body, the Petrograd Soviet (or workers' council) four days earlier."
The Petrograd Soviet and the Provisional Government competed for power over Russia.
The model for the Soviets were workers' councils that had been established in scores of Russian cities during the 1905 Revolution.
"In February 1917, striking workers elected deputies to represent them and socialist activists began organizing a citywide council to unite these deputies with representatives of the socialist parties."
"On 27 February, socialist Duma deputies, mainly Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, took the lead in organizing a citywide council."
They also believed Russia was not ready for socialism.
"They viewed their role as limited to pressuring hesitant ""bourgeoisie"" to rule and to introduce extensive democratic reforms in Russia (the replacement of the monarchy by a republic, guaranteed civil rights, a democratic police and army, abolition of religious and ethnic discrimination, preparation of elections to a constituent assembly, and so on)."
"The representatives of the Provisional Government agreed to ""take into account the opinions of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies"", though they were also determined to prevent interference which would create an unacceptable situation of dual power."
"In fact, this was precisely what was being created, though this ""dual power"" (dvoyevlastiye) was the result less of the actions or attitudes of the leaders of these two institutions than of actions outside their control, especially the ongoing social movement taking place on the streets of Russia's cities, factories, shops, barracks, villages, and in the trenches."
A series of political crises – see the chronology below – in the relationship between population and government and between the Provisional Government and the Soviets (which developed into a nationwide movement with a national leadership).
The All-Russian Central Executive Committee of Soviets (VTsIK) undermined the authority of the Provisional Government but also of the moderate socialist leaders of the Soviets.
"Although the Soviet leadership initially refused to participate in the ""bourgeois"" Provisional Government, Alexander Kerensky, a young, popular lawyer and a member of the Socialist Revolutionary Party (SRP), agreed to join the new cabinet, and became an increasingly central figure in the government, eventually taking leadership of the Provisional Government."
"As minister of war and later Prime Minister, Kerensky promoted freedom of speech, released thousands of political prisoners, continued the war effort, even organizing another offensive (which, however, was no more successful than its predecessors)."
Heavy military losses were being suffered on the front.
The soldiers were dissatisfied and demoralised and had started to defect.
"There was enormous discontent with Russia's involvement in the war, and many were calling for an end to it."
"Lenin had been living in exile in neutral Switzerland and, due to democratization of politics after the February Revolution, which legalized formerly banned political parties, he perceived the opportunity for his Marxist revolution."
"Although return to Russia had become a possibility, the war made it logistically difficult."
"Eventually, German officials arranged for Lenin to pass through their territory, hoping that his activities would weaken Russia or even – if the Bolsheviks came to power – lead to Russia's withdrawal from the war."
"Lenin and his associates, however, had to agree to travel to Russia in a sealed train: Germany would not take the chance that he would foment revolution in Germany."
"After passing through the front, he arrived in Petrograd in April 1917."
"On the way to Russia, Lenin prepared the April Theses, which outlined central Bolshevik policies."
"These included that the Soviets take power (as seen in the slogan ""all power to the Soviets"") and denouncing the liberals and social revolutionaries in the Provisional Government, forbidding co-operation with it."
"Many Bolsheviks, however, had supported the Provisional Government, including Lev Kamenev."
"With Lenin's arrival, the popularity of the Bolsheviks increased steadily."
"Over the course of the spring, public dissatisfaction with the Provisional Government and the war, in particular among workers, soldiers and peasants, pushed these groups to radical parties."
"Despite growing support for the Bolsheviks, buoyed by maxims that called most famously for ""all power to the Soviets"", the party held very little real power in the moderate-dominated Petrograd Soviet."
"In fact, historians such as Sheila Fitzpatrick have asserted that Lenin's exhortations for the Soviet Council to take power were intended to arouse indignation both with the Provisional Government, whose policies were viewed as conservative, and the Soviets themselves, which were viewed as subservients to the conservative government."
"By some other historians' accounts, Lenin and his followers were unprepared for how their groundswell of support, especially among influential worker and soldier groups, would translate into real power in the summer of 1917."
"On 18 June, the Provisional Government launched an attack against Germany that failed miserably."
"Soon after, the government ordered soldiers to go to the front, reneging on a promise."
The soldiers refused to follow the new orders.
"The arrival of radical Kronstadt sailors – who had tried and executed many officers, including one admiral – further fueled the growing revolutionary atmosphere."
"Sailors and soldiers, along with Petrograd workers, took to the streets in violent protest, calling for ""all power to the Soviets""."
"The revolt, however, was disowned by Lenin and the Bolshevik leaders and dissipated within a few days."
"In the aftermath, Lenin fled to Finland under threat of arrest while Trotsky, among other prominent Bolsheviks, was arrested."
"The July Days confirmed the popularity of the anti-war, radical Bolsheviks, but their unpreparedness at the moment of revolt was an embarrassing gaffe that lost them support among their main constituent groups: soldiers and workers."
The Bolshevik failure in the July Days proved temporary.
The Bolsheviks had undergone a spectacular growth in membership.
"Whereas, in February 1917, the Bolsheviks were limited to only 24,000 members, by September 1917 there were 200,000 members of the Bolshevik faction."
"Previously, the Bolsheviks had been in the minority in the two leading cities of Russia—St."
"Petersburg and Moscow behind the Mensheviks and the Socialist Revolutionaries, by September the Bolsheviks were in the majority in both cities."
"Furthermore, the Bolshevik-controlled Moscow Regional Bureau of the Party also controlled the Party organizations of the 13 provinces around Moscow."
"In response, he ordered troops to Petrograd to pacify the city."
"To secure his position, Kerensky had to ask for Bolshevik assistance."
"He also sought help from the Petrograd Soviet, which called upon armed Red Guards to ""defend the revolution""."
"The Kornilov Affair failed largely due to the efforts of the Bolsheviks, whose influence over railroad and telegraph workers proved vital in stopping the movement of troops."
"With his coup failing, Kornilov surrendered and was relieved of his position."
The Bolsheviks' role in stopping the attempted coup further strengthened their position.
"In early September, the Petrograd Soviet freed all jailed Bolsheviks and Trotsky became chairman of the Petrograd Soviet."
Growing numbers of socialists and lower-class Russians viewed the government less as a force in support of their needs and interests.
"The Bolsheviks benefited as the only major organized opposition party that had refused to compromise with the Provisional Government, and they benefited from growing frustration and even disgust with other parties, such as the Mensheviks and Socialist Revolutionaries, who stubbornly refused to break with the idea of national unity across all classes."
"In Finland, Lenin had worked on his book State and Revolution and continued to lead his party, writing newspaper articles and policy decrees."
"Recognising the strength of the Bolsheviks, Lenin began pressing for the immediate overthrow of the Kerensky government by the Bolsheviks."
"The Bolshevik Central Committee drafted a resolution, calling for the dissolution of the Provisional Government in favor of the Petrograd Soviet."
The resolution was passed 10–2 (Lev Kamenev and Grigory Zinoviev prominently dissenting) promoting the October Revolution.
Lenin did not have any direct role in the revolution and due to his personal security he was hiding.
The Revolutionary Military Committee established by the Bolshevik party was organizing the insurrection and Leon Trotsky was the chairman.
"However, Lenin played a crucial role in the debate in the leadership of the Bolshevik party for a revolutionary insurrection as the party in the autumn of 1917 received a majority in the soviets."
The Civil War began in early 1918 with domestic anti-Bolshevik forces confronting the nascent Red Army.
In autumn of 1918 Allied countries needed to block German access to Russian supplies.
"They sent troops to support the ""Whites"" with supplies of weapons, ammunition and logistic equipment being sent from the main Western countries but this was not at all coordinated."
This non-elected provisional government faced the revolutionary situation and the growing mood against the war by avoiding elections to the state Duma.
"However, the October revolution forced the political parties behind the newly dissolved provisional government to move and move fast for immediate elections."
All happened so fast that the left SR fraction did not have time to reach out and be represented in ballots of the SR party which was part of the coalition in the provisional government.
This non-elected government supported continuation of the war on the side of the allied forces.
The elections to the State Duma 25 November 1917 therefore did not mirror the true political situation among peasants even if we don't know how the outcome would be if the anti-war left SR fraction had a fair chance to challenge the party leaders.
In the elections the Bolshevik party received 25% of the votes and the Socialist-Revolutionaries as much as 58%.
It is possible the left SR had a good chance to reach more than 25% of the votes and thereby legitimate the October revolution but we can only guess.
Lenin did not believe as Karl Marx that a socialist revolution presupposed a developed capitalist economy and not in a semi-capitalist country as Russia.
"Critics on the Right have long argued that the financial and logistical assistance of German intelligence via their key agent, Alexander Parvus was a key component as well, though historians are divided, since there is little evidence supporting that claim."
"Soviet membership was initially freely elected, but many members of the Socialist Revolutionary Party, anarchists, and other leftists created opposition to the Bolsheviks through the Soviets themselves."
The elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly took place 25 November 1917.
"When it became clear that the Bolsheviks had little support outside of the industrialized areas of Saint Petersburg and Moscow, they simply barred non-Bolsheviks from membership in the Soviets."
The Bolsheviks dissolved the Constituent Assembly in January 1918.
"The war was fought mainly between the Red Army (""Reds""), consisting of the uprising majority led by the Bolshevik minority, and the ""Whites"" – army officers and cossacks, the ""bourgeoisie"", and political groups ranging from the far Right, to the Socialist Revolutionaries who opposed the drastic restructuring championed by the Bolsheviks following the collapse of the Provisional Government, to the Soviets (under clear Bolshevik dominance)."
"The Whites had backing from other countries such as the United Kingdom, France, the United States, and Japan, while the Reds possessed internal support, proving to be much more effective."
"They eventually reached the Easterly Siberian Russian coast in Vladivostok, four years after the war began, an occupation that is believed to have ended all significant military campaigns in the nation."
"Less than one year later, the last area controlled by the White Army, the Ayano-Maysky District, directly to the north of the Krai containing Vladivostok, was given up when General Anatoly Pepelyayev capitulated in 1923."
"Several revolts were initiated against the Bolsheviks and their army near the end of the war, notably the Kronstadt Rebellion."
"This was a naval mutiny engineered by Soviet Baltic sailors, former Red Army soldiers, and the people of Kronstadt."
"This armed uprising was fought against the antagonizing Bolshevik economic policies that farmers were subjected to, including seizures of grain crops by the Communists."
This all amounted to large-scale discontent.
"When delegates representing the Kronstadt sailors arrived at Petrograd for negotiations, they raised 15 demands primarily pertaining to the Russian right to freedom."
"The Government firmly denounced the rebellions and labelled the requests as a reminder of the Social Revolutionaries, a political party that was popular among Soviets before Lenin, but refused to cooperate with the Bolshevik Army."
The Government then responded with an armed suppression of these revolts and suffered ten thousand casualties before entering the city of Kronstadt.
"However, a Bolshevik force under Mikhail Frunze destroyed the Makhnovist movement, when the Makhnovists refused to merge into the Red Army."
"In addition, the so-called ""Green Army"" (peasants defending their property against the opposing forces) played a secondary role in the war, mainly in the Ukraine."
"At the Civil War's zenith, it is reported that upwards of 200,000 cases were investigated by approximately 200 tribunals."
"These tribunals established themselves more so from the Cheka as a more moderate force that acted under the banner of revolutionary justice, rather than a utilizer of strict brute force as the former did."
"However, these tribunals did come with their own set of inefficiencies, such as responding to cases in a matter of months and not having a concrete definition of ""counter-revolution"" that was determined on a case-by-case basis."
"The ""Decree on Revolutionary Tribunals"" used by the People's Commissar of Justice, states in article 2 that ""In fixing the penalty, the Revolutionary Tribunal shall be guided by the circumstances of the case and the dictates of the revolutionary conscience."""
Revolutionary tribunals ultimately demonstrated that a form of justice was still prevalent in Russian society where the Russian Provisional Government failed.
"This, in part, triggered the political transition of the October Revolution and the Civil War that followed in its aftermath."
"In early March, the Provisional Government placed Nicholas and his family under house arrest in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoye Selo, 24 kilometres (15 mi) south of Petrograd."
"In August 1917 the Kerensky government evacuated the Romanovs to Tobolsk in the Urals, to protect them from the rising tide of revolution."
"However, Kerensky lost control after the Bolsheviks came to power in October 1917, and the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter and talk of putting Nicholas on trial increased."
"As the counter revolutionary White movement gathered force, leading to full-scale civil war by the summer, the Romanovs were moved during April and May 1918 to Yekaterinburg, a militant Bolshevik stronghold."
"During the early morning of 16 July, Nicholas, Alexandra, their children, their physician, and several servants were taken into the basement and shot."
"According to Edvard Radzinsky and Dmitrii Volkogonov, the order came directly from Lenin and Yakov Sverdlov in Moscow."
"That the order came from the top has long been believed, although there is a lack of hard evidence."
"The execution may have been carried out on the initiative of local Bolshevik officials, or it may have been an option pre-approved in Moscow should White troops approach Yekaterinburg."
Radzinsky noted that Lenin's bodyguard personally delivered the telegram ordering the execution and that he was ordered to destroy the evidence.
"Communist symbolism is perhaps the most notable of this time period, such as the debut of the iconic hammer and sickle as a representation of the October Revolution in 1917, eventually becoming the official symbol of the USSR in 1924."
"Although the Bolsheviks did not have extensive political experience, their portrayal of the revolution itself as both a political and symbolic order resulted in Communism's portrayal as a messianic faith, formally known as communist messianism."
Leon Trotsky said that the goal of socialism in Russia would not be realized without the success of the world revolution.
"A revolutionary wave caused by the Russian Revolution lasted until 1923, but despite initial hopes for success in the German Revolution of 1918–19, the short-lived Hungarian Soviet Republic, and others like it, no other Marxist movement at the time succeeded in keeping power in its hands."
This issue is subject to conflicting views on communist history by various Marxist groups and parties.
"Joseph Stalin later rejected this idea, stating that socialism was possible in one country."
"The confusion regarding Stalin's position on the issue stems from the fact that, after Lenin's death in 1924, he successfully used Lenin's argument – the argument that socialism's success needs the support of workers of other countries in order to happen – to defeat his competitors within the party by accusing them of betraying Lenin and, therefore, the ideals of the October Revolution."
"Marx had envisioned European revolutions to be intertwined with Asian revolutions in the mid-19th century with his 1853 New York Tribune article, ""Revolution in China and Europe,"" in which he references the Chinese as people in ""revolutionary convulsion,"" brought about by British economic control."
"The May Fourth Movement is considered a turning point where Communism took root in Chinese society, especially among intellectuals."
"China was officially made a communist country on 1 October 1949, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China (which still remains to this day) with Chairman Mao Zedong at its head."
"China's current leaders retain that Mao ""developed the theory of revolutionary socialism"" whilst reformer Deng Xiopeng ""developed the theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics."""
"Castro's 26th of July Movement and Cuban Revolution followed in the footsteps of the Sergeant's Revolt in Cuba in 1933, similarly to how the 1905 Revolution in Russia preceded the October Revolution."
"Castro's movement sought ""political democracy, political and economic nationalism, agrarian reform, industrialization, social security, and education."""
"Similarly to the October Revolution, the Cuban Revolution removed a more traditional, hierarchical regime with the aim of establishing greater overall equality, specifically in the removal of former authoritarian president Fulgencio Batista."
"Cuba's revolution contributed to escalating tensions between the United States and USSR during Cold War, such as the CIA's failed Bay of Pigs Invasion by Cuban exiles in April 1961, and the Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962."
"Today, Cuba is moving more towards Capitalism and a free-market economy, as the Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) believes Castro's policies during his rule fostered ""an acceptance that market forces can play a role in economic policy and that economic growth must be the central criterion to judge economic success."""
"During the Second World War, the French and Japanese fascists in French Indochina (now known as Southeast Asia) began to experience significant resistance to their colonial rule."
"Due to the fact that both France and Japan were engaged in World War II, the Vietnamese people realized an opportunity to engage in an uprising, resulting in the bloody August Insurrection, ending colonial rule in Vietnam."
"Marxism was manifested in Vietnam as early as the Spring of 1925 when the Vietnamese Revolutionary Youth League was established, with the league being described as ""first truly Marxist organization in Indochina"" The domino effect caused more concern among Western countries in regards to Communism in Southeast Asia."
"One interpretation of the United States' involvement in the Vietnam War is ""America had lost a guerrilla war in Asia, a loss of caused by failure to appreciate the nuances of counterinsurgency war."""
"Since the Fall of Saigon on 30 April 1975, Vietnam has remained a communist country."
"The historiography of the Revolution generally divides into three camps: the Soviet-Marxist view, the Western-Totalitarian view, and the Revisionist view."
"Since the fall of Communism (and the USSR) in Russia in 1991, the Western-Totalitarian view has again become dominant and the Soviet-Marxist view has practically vanished."
"Lenin had consolidated the principle of state penetration of the whole society, its economy and its culture."
"Lenin had practised terror and advocated revolutionary amoralism."""
It was 12 days behind the Gregorian calendar during the 19th century and thirteen days behind it during the 20th century.
"It describes the dictator Joseph Stalin as a big Berkshire boar named, ""Napoleon."""
Trotsky is represented by a pig called Snowball who is a brilliant talker and makes magnificent speeches.
"However, Napoleon overthrows Snowball as Stalin overthrew Trotsky and Napoleon takes over the farm the animals live on."
"Napoleon becomes a tyrant and uses force and propaganda to oppress the animals, while culturally teaching them that they are free."
"Their contributions to mathematics, astronomy, and medicine entered and shaped Greek natural philosophy of classical antiquity, whereby formal attempts were made to provide explanations of events in the physical world based on natural causes."
"After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, knowledge of Greek conceptions of the world deteriorated in Western Europe during the early centuries (400 to 1000 CE) of the Middle Ages, but was preserved in the Muslim world during the Islamic Golden Age."
"The recovery and assimilation of Greek works and Islamic inquiries into Western Europe from the 10th to 13th century revived ""natural philosophy"", which was later transformed by the Scientific Revolution that began in the 16th century as new ideas and discoveries departed from previous Greek conceptions and traditions."
"The scientific method soon played a greater role in knowledge creation and it was not until the 19th century that many of the institutional and professional features of science began to take shape; along with the changing of ""natural philosophy"" to ""natural science."
"There is disagreement, however, on whether the formal sciences actually constitute a science as they do not rely on empirical evidence."
"The practical impact of scientific research has led to the emergence of science policies that seek to influence the scientific enterprise by prioritizing the development of commercial products, armaments, health care, public infrastructure, and environmental protection."
"Modern science is distinct in its approach and successful in its results, so it now defines what science is in the strictest sense of the term."
"Science in its original sense was a word for a type of knowledge, rather than a specialized word for the pursuit of such knowledge."
"In particular, it was the type of knowledge that people can communicate to each other and share."
"For example, knowledge about the working of natural things was gathered long before recorded history and led to the development of complex abstract thought."
"This is shown by the construction of complex calendars, techniques for making poisonous plants edible, public works at a national scale, such as those which harnessed the floodplain of the Yangtse with reservoirs, dams, and dikes, and buildings such as the Pyramids."
"However, no consistent conscious distinction was made between knowledge of such things, which are true in every community, and other types of communal knowledge, such as mythologies and legal systems."
"Metallurgy was known in prehistory, and the Vinča culture was the earliest known producer of bronze-like alloys."
It is thought that early experimentation with heating and mixing of substances over time developed into alchemy.
"The ancient Mesopotamians used knowledge about the properties of various natural chemicals for manufacturing pottery, faience, glass, soap, metals, lime plaster, and waterproofing; they also studied animal physiology, anatomy, and behavior for divinatory purposes and made extensive records of the movements of astronomical objects for their study of astrology."
"Nonetheless, the Mesopotamians seem to have had little interest in gathering information about the natural world for the mere sake of gathering information and mainly only studied scientific subjects which had obvious practical applications or immediate relevance to their religious system."
"Instead, well-educated, usually upper-class, and almost universally male individuals performed various investigations into nature whenever they could afford the time."
"Before the invention or discovery of the concept of ""nature"" (ancient Greek phusis) by the Pre-Socratic philosophers, the same words tend to be used to describe the natural ""way"" in which a plant grows, and the ""way"" in which, for example, one tribe worships a particular god."
"For this reason, it is claimed these men were the first philosophers in the strict sense, and also the first people to clearly distinguish ""nature"" and ""convention."""
"Natural philosophy, the precursor of natural science, was thereby distinguished as the knowledge of nature and things which are true for every community, and the name of the specialized pursuit of such knowledge was philosophy – the realm of the first philosopher-physicists."
"They were mainly speculators or theorists, particularly interested in astronomy."
The Pythagoreans developed a complex number philosophy and contributed significantly to the development of mathematical science.
The theory of atoms was developed by the Greek philosopher Leucippus and his student Democritus.
"The Greek doctor Hippocrates established the tradition of systematic medical science and is known as ""The Father of Medicine""."
"A turning point in the history of early philosophical science was Socrates' example of applying philosophy to the study of human matters, including human nature, the nature of political communities, and human knowledge itself."
The Socratic method as documented by Plato's dialogues is a dialectic method of hypothesis elimination: better hypotheses are found by steadily identifying and eliminating those that lead to contradictions.
This was a reaction to the Sophist emphasis on rhetoric.
"The Socratic method searches for general, commonly held truths that shape beliefs and scrutinizes them to determine their consistency with other beliefs."
Socrates criticized the older type of study of physics as too purely speculative and lacking in self-criticism.
"Socrates was later, in the words of his Apology, accused of corrupting the youth of Athens because he did ""not believe in the gods the state believes in, but in other new spiritual beings""."
"In his physics, the Sun goes around the Earth, and many things have it as part of their nature that they are for humans."
"Each thing has a formal cause, a final cause, and a role in a cosmic order with an unmoved mover."
The Socratics also insisted that philosophy should be used to consider the practical question of the best way to live for a human being (a study Aristotle divided into ethics and political philosophy).
Aristarchus's model was widely rejected because it was believed to violate the laws of physics.
"The inventor and mathematician Archimedes of Syracuse made major contributions to the beginnings of calculus and has sometimes been credited as its inventor, although his proto-calculus lacked several defining features."
"Pliny the Elder was a Roman writer and polymath, who wrote the seminal encyclopedia Natural History, dealing with history, geography, medicine, astronomy, earth science, botany, and zoology."
"Other scientists or proto-scientists in Antiquity were Theophrastus, Euclid, Herophilos, Hipparchus, Ptolemy, and Galen."
"In contrast, the Byzantine Empire resisted the attacks from invaders, and preserved and improved upon the learning."
"John Philoponus, a Byzantine scholar in the 500s, questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics and to note its flaws."
"Aristotle's four causes prescribed that the question ""why"" should be answered in four ways in order to explain things scientifically."
"Some ancient knowledge was lost, or in some cases kept in obscurity, during the fall of the Western Roman Empire and periodic political struggles."
"However, the general fields of science (or ""natural philosophy"" as it was called) and much of the general knowledge from the ancient world remained preserved through the works of the early Latin encyclopedists like Isidore of Seville."
"However, Aristotle's original texts were eventually lost in Western Europe, and only one text by Plato was widely known, the Timaeus, which was the only Platonic dialogue, and one of the few original works of classical natural philosophy, available to Latin readers in the early Middle Ages."
"Another original work that gained influence in this period was Ptolemy's Almagest, which contains a geocentric description of the solar system."
"During late antiquity, in the Byzantine empire many Greek classical texts were preserved."
Many Syriac translations were done by groups such as the Nestorians and Monophysites.
"They played a role when they translated Greek classical texts into Arabic under the Caliphate, during which many types of classical learning were preserved and in some cases improved upon."
"Al-Kindi (801–873) was the first of the Muslim Peripatetic philosophers, and is known for his efforts to introduce Greek and Hellenistic philosophy to the Arab world."
The Islamic Golden Age flourished from this time until the Mongol invasions of the 13th century.
"Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen), as well as his predecessor Ibn Sahl, was familiar with Ptolemy's Optics, and used experiments as a means to gain knowledge."
"Alhazen disproved Ptolemy's theory of vision, but did not make any corresponding changes to Aristotle's metaphysics."
"Furthermore, doctors and alchemists such as the Persians Avicenna and Al-Razi also greatly developed the science of Medicine with the former writing the Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia used until the 18th century and the latter discovering multiple compounds like alcohol."
"Demand for Latin translations grew (for example, from the Toledo School of Translators); western Europeans began collecting texts written not only in Latin, but also Latin translations from Greek, Arabic, and Hebrew."
"Manuscript copies of Alhazen's Book of Optics also propagated across Europe before 1240, as evidenced by its incorporation into Vitello's Perspectiva."
Avicenna's Canon was translated into Latin.
"In particular, the texts of Aristotle, Ptolemy, and Euclid, preserved in the Houses of Wisdom and also in the Byzantine Empire, were sought amongst Catholic scholars."
"The influx of ancient texts caused the Renaissance of the 12th century and the flourishing of a synthesis of Catholicism and Aristotelianism known as Scholasticism in western Europe, which became a new geographic center of science."
"An experiment in this period would be understood as a careful process of observing, describing, and classifying."
One prominent scientist in this era was Roger Bacon.
"Scholasticism had a strong focus on revelation and dialectic reasoning, and gradually fell out of favour over the next centuries, as alchemy's focus on experiments that include direct observation and meticulous documentation slowly increased in importance."
"Before what we now know as the Renaissance started, Roger Bacon, Vitello, and John Peckham each built up a scholastic ontology upon a causal chain beginning with sensation, perception, and finally apperception of the individual and universal forms of Aristotle."
A model of vision later known as perspectivism was exploited and studied by the artists of the Renaissance.
Kepler modelled the eye as a water-filled glass sphere with an aperture in front of it to model the entrance pupil.
He found that all the light from a single point of the scene was imaged at a single point at the back of the glass sphere.
The optical chain ends on the retina at the back of the eye.
"Kepler is best known, however, for improving Copernicus' heliocentric model through the discovery of Kepler's laws of planetary motion."
Kepler did not reject Aristotelian metaphysics and described his work as a search for the Harmony of the Spheres.
Galileo made innovative use of experiment and mathematics.
"However, he became persecuted after Pope Urban VIII blessed Galileo to write about the Copernican system."
René Descartes and Francis Bacon published philosophical arguments in favor of a new type of non-Aristotelian science.
Descartes emphasized individual thought and argued that mathematics rather than geometry should be used in order to study nature.
Bacon emphasized the importance of experiment over contemplation.
"Bacon further questioned the Aristotelian concepts of formal cause and final cause, and promoted the idea that science should study the laws of ""simple"" natures, such as heat, rather than assuming that there is any specific nature, or ""formal cause"", of each complex type of thing."
"This new science began to see itself as describing ""laws of nature""."
This updated approach to studies in nature was seen as mechanistic.
Bacon also argued that science should aim for the first time at practical inventions for the improvement of all human life.
"Leibniz also incorporated terms from Aristotelian physics, but now being used in a new non-teleological way, for example, ""energy"" and ""potential"" (modern versions of Aristotelian ""energeia and potentia"")."
"This implied a shift in the view of objects: Where Aristotle had noted that objects have certain innate goals that can be actualized, objects were now regarded as devoid of innate goals."
"In the style of Francis Bacon, Leibniz assumed that different types of things all work according to the same general laws of nature, with no special formal or final causes for each type of thing."
"It is during this period that the word ""science"" gradually became more commonly used to refer to a type of pursuit of a type of knowledge, especially knowledge of nature – coming close in meaning to the old term ""natural philosophy."""
"During this time, the declared purpose and value of science became producing wealth and inventions that would improve human lives, in the materialistic sense of having more food, clothing, and other things."
Societies and academies were also the backbones of the maturation of the scientific profession.
Another important development was the popularization of science among an increasingly literate population.
"Philosophes introduced the public to many scientific theories, most notably through the Encyclopédie and the popularization of Newtonianism by Voltaire as well as by Émilie du Châtelet, the French translator of Newton's Principia."
"Some historians have marked the 18th century as a drab period in the history of science; however, the century saw significant advancements in the practice of medicine, mathematics, and physics; the development of biological taxonomy; a new understanding of magnetism and electricity; and the maturation of chemistry as a discipline, which established the foundations of modern chemistry."
"Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors – Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally – as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of nature and natural law to every physical and social field of the day."
"In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded."
Both John Herschel and William Whewell systematized methodology: the latter coined the term scientist.
When Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species in 1859 he established evolution as the prevailing explanation of biological complexity.
"His theory of natural selection provided a natural explanation of how species originated, but this only gained wide acceptance a century later."
"The laws of conservation of energy, conservation of momentum and conservation of mass suggested a highly stable universe where there could be little loss of resources."
"With the advent of the steam engine and the industrial revolution, there was, however, an increased understanding that all forms of energy as defined in physics were not equally useful: they did not have the same energy quality."
"This realization led to the development of the laws of thermodynamics, in which the free energy of the universe is seen as constantly declining: the entropy of a closed universe increases over time."
"The electromagnetic theory was also established in the 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework."
The phenomena that would allow the deconstruction of the atom were discovered in the last decade of the 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity.
"In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron."
"In the first half of the century, the development of antibiotics and artificial fertilizer made global human population growth possible."
"At the same time, the structure of the atom and its nucleus was discovered, leading to the release of ""atomic energy"" (nuclear power)."
"In addition, the extensive use of technological innovation stimulated by the wars of this century led to revolutions in transportation (automobiles and aircraft), the development of ICBMs, a space race, and a nuclear arms race."
The molecular structure of DNA was discovered in 1953.
The discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1964 led to a rejection of the Steady State theory of the universe in favour of the Big Bang theory of Georges Lemaître.
"The development of spaceflight in the second half of the century allowed the first astronomical measurements done on or near other objects in space, including six manned landings on the Moon."
Space telescopes lead to numerous discoveries in astronomy and cosmology.
"Widespread use of integrated circuits in the last quarter of the 20th century combined with communications satellites led to a revolution in information technology and the rise of the global internet and mobile computing, including smartphones."
"In 2015, gravitational waves, predicted by general relativity a century before, were first observed."
Each of these branches comprises various specialized yet overlapping scientific disciplines that often possess their own nomenclature and expertise.
The relationships between the branches of science are summarized by the following table.
It can be divided into two main branches: life science (or biological science) and physical science.
These two branches may be further divided into more specialized disciplines.
"Physical science is subdivided into branches, including physics, chemistry, astronomy and earth science."
Modern natural science is the successor to the natural philosophy that began in Ancient Greece.
"Galileo, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way."
"Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science."
"Systematic data collection, including discovery science, succeeded natural history, which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on."
"Today, ""natural history"" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences."
"It has many branches that include, but are not limited to, anthropology, archaeology, communication studies, economics, history, human geography, jurisprudence, linguistics, political science, psychology, public health, and sociology."
Social scientists may adopt various philosophical theories to study individuals and society.
"For example, positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense."
"Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense."
"In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research)."
"The term ""social research"" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share in its aims and methods."
"It includes mathematics, systems theory, and theoretical computer science."
"The formal sciences share similarities with the other two branches by relying on objective, careful, and systematic study of an area of knowledge."
"They are, however, different from the empirical sciences as they rely exclusively on deductive reasoning, without the need for empirical evidence, to verify their abstract concepts."
"The formal sciences are therefore a priori disciplines and because of this, there is disagreement on whether they actually constitute a science."
"Nevertheless, the formal sciences play an important role in the empirical sciences."
"Calculus, for example, was initially invented to understand motion in physics."
"Natural and social sciences that rely heavily on mathematical applications include mathematical physics, mathematical chemistry, mathematical biology, mathematical finance, and mathematical economics."
Basic research is the search for knowledge and applied research is the search for solutions to practical problems using this knowledge.
"Although some scientific research is applied research into specific problems, a great deal of our understanding comes from the curiosity-driven undertaking of basic research."
This leads to options for technological advances that were not planned or sometimes even imaginable.
"This point was made by Michael Faraday when allegedly in response to the question ""what is the use of basic research?"""
"he responded: ""Sir, what is the use of a new-born child?""."
"For example, research into the effects of red light on the human eye's rod cells did not seem to have any practical purpose; eventually, the discovery that our night vision is not troubled by red light would lead search and rescue teams (among others) to adopt red light in the cockpits of jets and helicopters."
"Finally, even basic research can take unexpected turns, and there is some sense in which the scientific method is built to harness luck."
"An explanatory thought experiment or hypothesis is put forward as explanation using principles such as parsimony (also known as ""Occam's Razor"") and are generally expected to seek consilience – fitting well with other accepted facts related to the phenomena."
This new explanation is used to make falsifiable predictions that are testable by experiment or observation.
"The predictions are to be posted before a confirming experiment or observation is sought, as proof that no tampering has occurred."
Disproof of a prediction is evidence of progress.
"This is done partly through observation of natural phenomena, but also through experimentation that tries to simulate natural events under controlled conditions as appropriate to the discipline (in the observational sciences, such as astronomy or geology, a predicted observation might take the place of a controlled experiment)."
Experimentation is especially important in science to help establish causal relationships (to avoid the correlation fallacy).
"When a hypothesis proves unsatisfactory, it is either modified or discarded."
"If the hypothesis survived testing, it may become adopted into the framework of a scientific theory, a logically reasoned, self-consistent model or framework for describing the behavior of certain natural phenomena."
"A theory typically describes the behavior of much broader sets of phenomena than a hypothesis; commonly, a large number of hypotheses can be logically bound together by a single theory."
Thus a theory is a hypothesis explaining various other hypotheses.
"In that vein, theories are formulated according to most of the same scientific principles as hypotheses."
"This can be achieved by careful experimental design, transparency, and a thorough peer review process of the experimental results as well as any conclusions."
"After the results of an experiment are announced or published, it is normal practice for independent researchers to double-check how the research was performed, and to follow up by performing similar experiments to determine how dependable the results might be."
"Taken in its entirety, the scientific method allows for highly creative problem solving while minimizing any effects of subjective bias on the part of its users (especially the confirmation bias)."
"Ziman shows how scientists can identify patterns to each other across centuries; he refers to this ability as ""perceptual consensibility."""
"He then makes consensibility, leading to consensus, the touchstone of reliable knowledge."
"For example, it is used in quantitative scientific modeling, which can generate new hypotheses and predictions to be tested."
It is also used extensively in observing and collecting measurements.
"Statistics, a branch of mathematics, is used to summarize and analyze data, which allow scientists to assess the reliability and variability of their experimental results."
"Computational science applies computing power to simulate real-world situations, enabling a better understanding of scientific problems than formal mathematics alone can achieve."
"According to the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics, computation is now as important as theory and experiment in advancing scientific knowledge."
The philosophy of science seeks a deep understanding of what these underlying assumptions mean and whether they are valid.
The belief that scientific theories should and do represent metaphysical reality is known as realism.
"It can be contrasted with anti-realism, the view that the success of science does not depend on it being accurate about unobservable entities such as electrons."
"One form of anti-realism is idealism, the belief that the mind or consciousness is the most basic essence, and that each mind generates its own reality."
"In an idealistic world view, what is true for one mind need not be true for other minds."
There are different schools of thought in the philosophy of science.
"The most popular position is empiricism, which holds that knowledge is created by a process involving observation and that scientific theories are the result of generalizations from such observations."
"Empiricism generally encompasses inductivism, a position that tries to explain the way general theories can be justified by the finite number of observations humans can make and hence the finite amount of empirical evidence available to confirm scientific theories."
"This is necessary because the number of predictions those theories make is infinite, which means that they cannot be known from the finite amount of evidence using deductive logic only."
"Many versions of empiricism exist, with the predominant ones being Bayesianism and the hypothetico-deductive method."
"Empiricism has stood in contrast to rationalism, the position originally associated with Descartes, which holds that knowledge is created by the human intellect, not by observation."
"Critical rationalism is a contrasting 20th-century approach to science, first defined by Austrian-British philosopher Karl Popper."
Popper rejected the way that empiricism describes the connection between theory and observation.
"He claimed that theories are not generated by observation, but that observation is made in the light of theories and that the only way a theory can be affected by observation is when it comes in conflict with it."
Popper proposed replacing verifiability with falsifiability as the landmark of scientific theories and replacing induction with falsification as the empirical method.
"Popper further claimed that there is actually only one universal method, not specific to science: the negative method of criticism, trial and error."
It views scientific theories as black boxes with only their input (initial conditions) and output (predictions) being relevant.
"Consequences, theoretical entities, and logical structure are claimed to be something that should simply be ignored and that scientists should not make a fuss about (see interpretations of quantum mechanics)."
"Close to instrumentalism is constructive empiricism, according to which the main criterion for the success of a scientific theory is whether what it says about observable entities is true."
"Thomas Kuhn argued that the process of observation and evaluation takes place within a paradigm, a logically consistent ""portrait"" of the world that is consistent with observations made from its framing."
"He characterized normal science as the process of observation and ""puzzle solving"" which takes place within a paradigm, whereas revolutionary science occurs when one paradigm overtakes another in a paradigm shift."
"Each paradigm has its own distinct questions, aims, and interpretations."
"The choice between paradigms involves setting two or more ""portraits"" against the world and deciding which likeness is most promising."
A paradigm shift occurs when a significant number of observational anomalies arise in the old paradigm and a new paradigm makes sense of them.
"That is, the choice of a new paradigm is based on observations, even though those observations are made against the background of the old paradigm."
"For Kuhn, acceptance or rejection of a paradigm is a social process as much as a logical process."
Its main point is that a difference between natural and supernatural explanations should be made and that science should be restricted methodologically to natural explanations.
"That the restriction is merely methodological (rather than ontological) means that science should not consider supernatural explanations itself, but should not claim them to be wrong either."
"Instead, supernatural explanations should be left a matter of personal belief outside the scope of science."
Methodological naturalism maintains that proper science requires strict adherence to empirical study and independent verification as a process for properly developing and evaluating explanations for observable phenomena.
"The absence of these standards, arguments from authority, biased observational studies and other common fallacies are frequently cited by supporters of methodological naturalism as characteristic of the non-science they criticize."
"That is, no theory is ever considered strictly certain as science accepts the concept of fallibilism."
The philosopher of science Karl Popper sharply distinguished truth from certainty.
"""New scientific knowledge rarely results in vast changes in our understanding."
"According to psychologist Keith Stanovich, it may be the media's overuse of words like ""breakthrough"" that leads the public to imagine that science is constantly proving everything it thought was true to be false."
"While there are such famous cases as the theory of relativity that required a complete reconceptualization, these are extreme exceptions."
Knowledge in science is gained by a gradual synthesis of information from different experiments by various researchers across different branches of science; it is more like a climb than a leap.
"Theories vary in the extent to which they have been tested and verified, as well as their acceptance in the scientific community."
"For example, heliocentric theory, the theory of evolution, relativity theory, and germ theory still bear the name ""theory"" even though, in practice, they are considered factual."
"Philosopher Barry Stroud adds that, although the best definition for ""knowledge"" is contested, being skeptical and entertaining the possibility that one is incorrect is compatible with being correct."
"Research often analyzes few factors at once, but these are always added to the long list of factors that are most important to consider."
"For example, knowing the details of only a person's genetics, or their history and upbringing, or the current situation may not explain a behavior, but a deep understanding of all these variables combined can be very predictive."
"Scientific journals communicate and document the results of research carried out in universities and various other research institutions, serving as an archival record of science."
"The first scientific journals, Journal des Sçavans followed by the Philosophical Transactions, began publication in 1665."
Since that time the total number of active periodicals has steadily increased.
"In 1981, one estimate for the number of scientific and technical journals in publication was 11,500."
"The United States National Library of Medicine currently indexes 5,516 journals that contain articles on topics related to the life sciences."
"Science has become so pervasive in modern societies that it is generally considered necessary to communicate the achievements, news, and ambitions of scientists to a wider populace."
"Science magazines such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American cater to the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research."
Science books engage the interest of many more people.
"Tangentially, the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science."
"Recent efforts to intensify or develop links between science and non-scientific disciplines such as literature or more specifically, poetry, include the Creative Writing Science resource developed through the Royal Literary Fund."
The crisis has long-standing roots; the phrase was coined in the early 2010s as part of a growing awareness of the problem.
"The replication crisis represents an important body of research in metascience, which aims to improve the quality of all scientific research while reducing waste."
"Physicist Richard Feynman coined the term ""cargo cult science"" for cases in which researchers believe they are doing science because their activities have the outward appearance of science but actually lack the ""kind of utter honesty"" that allows their results to be rigorously evaluated."
"Various types of commercial advertising, ranging from hype to fraud, may fall into these categories."
"Sometimes, research may be characterized as ""bad science,"" research that may be well-intended but is actually incorrect, obsolete, incomplete, or over-simplified expositions of scientific ideas."
"The term ""scientific misconduct"" refers to situations such as where researchers have intentionally misrepresented their published data or have purposely given credit for a discovery to the wrong person."
"In modern times, many professional scientists are trained in an academic setting and upon completion, attain an academic degree, with the highest degree being a doctorate such as a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)."
Other motivations include recognition by their peers and prestige.
"The Nobel Prize, a widely regarded prestigious award, is awarded annually to those who have achieved scientific advances in the fields of medicine, physics, chemistry, and economics."
"Women faced considerable discrimination in science, much as they did in other areas of male-dominated societies, such as frequently being passed over for job opportunities and denied credit for their work."
Her work preceded notable researchers like Ludwig Wittgenstein and Charles Sanders Peirce.
"They earned more than half of the degrees in psychology (about 70%), social sciences (about 50%), and biology (about 50–60%) but earned less than half the degrees in the physical sciences, earth sciences, mathematics, engineering, and computer science."
"Lifestyle choice also plays a major role in female engagement in science; women with young children are 28% less likely to take tenure-track positions due to work-life balance issues, and female graduate students' interest in careers in research declines dramatically over the course of graduate school, whereas that of their male colleagues remains unchanged."
"Many scientists belong to a learned society that promotes their respective scientific discipline, profession, or group of related disciplines."
"Membership may be open to all, may require possession of some scientific credentials, or may be an honor conferred by election."
"Most scientific societies are non-profit organizations, and many are professional associations."
Their activities typically include holding regular conferences for the presentation and discussion of new research results and publishing or sponsoring academic journals in their discipline.
"Some also act as professional bodies, regulating the activities of their members in the public interest or the collective interest of the membership."
Scholars in the sociology of science argue that learned societies are of key importance and their formation assists in the emergence and development of new disciplines or professions.
Science policy also refers to the act of applying scientific knowledge and consensus to the development of public policies.
Science policy thus deals with the entire domain of issues that involve the natural sciences.
"In accordance with public policy being concerned about the well-being of its citizens, science policy's goal is to consider how science and technology can best serve the public."
"State policy has influenced the funding of public works and science for thousands of years, particularly within civilizations with highly organized governments such as imperial China and the Roman Empire."
This construction dates from the 6th century BCE under the Sui Dynasty and is still in use today.
"In China, such state-supported infrastructure and scientific research projects date at least from the time of the Mohists, who inspired the study of logic during the period of the Hundred Schools of Thought and the study of defensive fortifications like the Great Wall of China during the Warring States period."
Public policy can directly affect the funding of capital equipment and intellectual infrastructure for industrial research by providing tax incentives to those organizations that fund research.
"Vannevar Bush, director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development for the United States government, the forerunner of the National Science Foundation, wrote in July 1945 that ""Science is a proper concern of government."""
"Such processes, which are run by government, corporations, or foundations, allocate scarce funds."
"In the OECD, around two-thirds of research and development in scientific and technical fields is carried out by industry, and 20% and 10% respectively by universities and government."
"The government funding proportion in certain industries is higher, and it dominates research in social science and humanities."
biotechnology) government provides the bulk of the funds for basic scientific research.
Many governments have dedicated agencies to support scientific research.
"Prominent scientific organizations include the National Science Foundation in the United States, the National Scientific and Technical Research Council in Argentina, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) in Australia, Centre national de la recherche scientifique in France, the Max Planck Society and Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft in Germany, and CSIC in Spain."
"In commercial research and development, all but the most research-oriented corporations focus more heavily on near-term commercialisation possibilities rather than ""blue-sky"" ideas or technologies (such as nuclear fusion)."
"it integrates various themes and activities such as science communication, science museums, science festivals, science fairs, citizen science, and science in popular culture."
"Social scientists have devised various metrics to measure the public understanding of science such as factual knowledge, self-reported knowledge, and structural knowledge."
Determining how much weight to give different sides in a scientific debate may require considerable expertise regarding the matter.
"Few journalists have real scientific knowledge, and even beat reporters who know a great deal about certain scientific issues may be ignorant about other scientific issues that they are suddenly asked to cover."
"Many factors can act as facets of the politicization of science such as populist anti-intellectualism, perceived threats to religious beliefs, postmodernist subjectivism, and fear for business interests."
Politicization of science is usually accomplished when scientific information is presented in a way that emphasizes the uncertainty associated with the scientific evidence.
The scientific method is an empirical method of acquiring knowledge that has characterized the development of science since at least the 17th century.
"It involves careful observation, applying rigorous skepticism about what is observed, given that cognitive assumptions can distort how one interprets the observation."
"It involves formulating hypotheses, via induction, based on such observations; experimental and measurement-based testing of deductions drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings."
"People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or hypotheses about why things are the way they are."
The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways.
The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data.
"Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection."
"The process of the scientific method involves making conjectures (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions."
"A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question."
"The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad."
Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies.
Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
"There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however."
"Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles."
"Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order."
"The term ""scientific method"" emerged in the 19th century, when a significant institutional development of science was taking place and terminologies establishing clear boundaries between science and non-science, such as ""scientist"" and ""pseudoscience"", appeared."
"Throughout the 1830s and 1850s, by which time Baconianism was popular, naturalists like William Whewell, John Herschel, John Stuart Mill engaged in debates over ""induction"" and ""facts"" and were focused on how to generate knowledge."
"Although there was a growth through the middle of the twentieth century, by the 1960s and 1970s numerous influential philosophers of science such as Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend had questioned the universality of the ""scientific method"" and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice."
"In particular, Paul Feyerabend, in the 1975 first edition of his book Against Method, argued against there being any universal rules of science."
"Later examples include physicist Lee Smolin's 2013 essay ""There Is No Scientific Method"" and historian of science Daniel Thurs's chapter in the 2015 book Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science, which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or, at best, an idealization."
"Philosophers Robert Nola and Howard Sankey, in their 2007 book Theories of Scientific Method, said that debates over scientific method continue, and argued that Feyerabend, despite the title of Against Method, accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a metamethodology."
"As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge and develop a more sophisticated understanding of its topics of study over time."
This is in opposition to stringent forms of rationalism: the scientific method embodies that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem.
"A strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of empiricism in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge; in current scientific practice, however, the use of scientific modelling and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted."
"revelation, political or religious dogma, appeals to tradition, commonly held beliefs, common sense, or, importantly, currently held theories, are the only possible means of demonstrating truth."
"Different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history, for instance with the ancient Stoics, Epicurus, Alhazen, Roger Bacon, and William of Ockham."
"From the 16th century onwards, experiments were advocated by Francis Bacon, and performed by Giambattista della Porta, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo Galilei."
"There was particular development  aided by theoretical works by Francisco Sanches, John Locke, George Berkeley, and David Hume."
"The hypothetico-deductive model formulated in the 20th century, is the ideal although it has undergone significant revision since first proposed (for a more formal discussion, see below)."
Staddon (2017) argues it is a mistake to try following rules which are best learned through careful study of examples of scientific investigation.
"There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however."
"Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles."
"Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order."
"As noted by scientist and philosopher William Whewell (1794–1866), ""invention, sagacity, [and] genius"" are required at every step."
"but can also be open-ended, as in ""How can I design a drug to cure this particular disease?"""
"This stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments, personal scientific observations or assertions, as well as the work of other scientists."
"If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed."
"When applying the scientific method to research, determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation."
"The hypothesis might be very specific; for example, Einstein's equivalence principle or Francis Crick's ""DNA makes RNA makes protein"", or it might be broad; for example, unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans."
A statistical hypothesis is a conjecture about a given statistical population.
"For example, the population might be people with a particular disease."
The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people.
Terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.
"A null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false; for example, that the new drug does nothing and that any cure is caused by chance."
Researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false.
"The alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome, that the drug does better than chance."
"A final point: a scientific hypothesis must be falsifiable, meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested."
One or more predictions are then selected for further testing.
"The more unlikely that a prediction would be correct simply by coincidence, then the more convincing it would be if the prediction were fulfilled; evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known, due to the effects of hindsight bias (see also postdiction)."
"Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other."
(These statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using Bayes' Theorem).
Scientists (and other people) test hypotheses by conducting experiments.
The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether observations of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.
"If they agree, confidence in the hypothesis increases; otherwise, it decreases."
Agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true; future experiments may reveal problems.
Large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.
"Experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors, especially through the use of appropriate scientific controls."
"For example, tests of medical treatments are commonly run as double-blind tests."
"Test personnel, who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are placebos, are kept ignorant of which are which."
Such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects.
"Furthermore, failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false."
"Experiments can be conducted in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's Large Hadron Collider, at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars (using one of the working rovers), and so on."
"Astronomers do experiments, searching for planets around distant stars."
"Finally, most individual experiments address highly specific topics for reasons of practicality."
"As a result, evidence about broader topics is usually accumulated gradually."
"The predictions of the hypothesis are compared to those of the null hypothesis, to determine which is better able to explain the data."
"In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a statistical analysis such as a chi-squared test may be required."
"If the evidence has falsified the hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the experiment supports the hypothesis but the evidence is not strong enough for high confidence, other predictions from the hypothesis must be tested."
"Once a hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence, a new question can be asked to provide further insight on the same topic."
Evidence from other scientists and experience are frequently incorporated at any stage in the process.
"Depending on the complexity of the experiment, many iterations may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer a question with confidence or to build up many answers to highly specific questions in order to answer a single broader question."
"DNA had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment in 1944, but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear."
"Prediction: If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped."
"This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick and Vand (and independently by Stokes)."
"This prediction was a mathematical construct, completely independent from the biological problem at hand."
Experiment: Rosalind Franklin used pure DNA to perform X-ray diffraction to produce photo 51.
The results showed an X-shape.
"When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix."
Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.
"As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of experimental error."
"For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work."
Replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals.
"Typically an experimental group gets the treatment, such as drug, and the control group gets a placebo."
John Ioannidis in 2005 pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated.
"Some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers, especially if the field is highly specialized."
"Peer-review does not certify the correctness of the results, only that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter)."
"If the work passes peer review, which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal."
The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.
"Though not typically required, they might be requested to supply this data to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain."
"This allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study, and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease)."
"The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it frequently can be, and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives."
The most successful explanations – those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances – are often called scientific theories.
"Most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time, sometimes across different domains of science."
"Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community."
"In general, explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic, and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence."
"Often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time, or combined explanations to produce new explanations."
Tow sees the scientific method in terms of an evolutionary algorithm applied to science and technology.
"That is, no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered."
"If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence."
The strength of a theory can be argued to relate to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles.
Theories can also become subsumed by other theories.
"For example, Newton's laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets almost perfectly."
"However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory (relativity), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of light by gravity."
"For example, the theory of evolution explains the diversity of life on Earth, how species adapt to their environments, and many other patterns observed in the natural world; its most recent major modification was unification with genetics to form the modern evolutionary synthesis."
"In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as biochemistry and molecular biology."
"This is frequently possible in certain areas, such as in the biological sciences, and more difficult in other areas, such as in astronomy."
"The practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance, and to a degree, personal bias."
"For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in confirmation bias; this is a heuristic that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe)."
"A historical example is the belief that the legs of a galloping horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touch the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters."
When a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.
Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized.
"Sometimes, these have their elements assumed a priori, or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them."
The scientific community and philosophers of science generally agree on the following classification of method components.
These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of natural sciences than social sciences.
"Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below."
"For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's Principia."
"On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain."
"Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work."
"While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method, a number of philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, including Paul Feyerabend, claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced."
"While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also entail some definitions and observations; the observations often demand careful measurements and/or counting."
"The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between pseudo-sciences, such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology."
"Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as correlation and regression, performed on them."
"The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations."
"The measurements often require specialized scientific instruments such as thermometers, spectroscopes, particle accelerators, or voltmeters, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement."
I am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations.
The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity.
Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used.
"Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations."
"Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken."
"That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or ""idealized"" definition."
"For example, electric current, measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail."
"The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of ""mass"" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France."
The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its natural language usage.
"For example, mass and weight overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in mechanics."
Scientific quantities are often characterized by their units of measure which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.
New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined.
"For example, Albert Einstein's first paper on relativity begins by defining simultaneity and the means for determining length."
"These ideas were skipped over by Isaac Newton with, ""I do not define time, space, place and motion, as being well known to all."""
"Francis Crick cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood."
"In Crick's study of consciousness, he actually found it easier to study awareness in the visual system, rather than to study free will, for example."
"His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them."
"Researchers in Bragg's laboratory at Cambridge University made X-ray diffraction pictures of various molecules, starting with crystals of salt, and proceeding to more complicated substances."
"Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle."
"It took thousands of years of measurements, from the Chaldean, Indian, Persian, Greek, Arabic and European astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet Earth."
Newton was able to include those measurements into consequences of his laws of motion.
"But the perihelion of the planet Mercury's orbit exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), as Leverrier pointed out in 1859."
The observed difference for Mercury's precession between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to Albert Einstein as a possible early test of his theory of General relativity.
His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory.
The difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century.
Normally hypotheses have the form of a mathematical model.
"Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as existential statements, stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of universal statements, stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic."
"Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, inductive reasoning, Bayesian inference, and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study."
"Albert Einstein once observed that ""there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."""
"The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a ""flash of inspiration"", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea."
Michael Polanyi made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.
"In general scientists tend to look for theories that are ""elegant"" or ""beautiful""."
"Scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is in accordance with the known facts, but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle."
Occam's Razor serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.
"To minimize the confirmation bias which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, strong inference emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses."
"When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure."
It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature.
The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.
It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown.
Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true.
"If the outcome is already known, it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while formulating the hypothesis."
"If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense."
A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible.
"For example, while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation, there is no known experiment that can test this hypothesis."
"Therefore, science itself can have little to say about the possibility."
"In the future, a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science."
This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.
"This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand (and independently by Stokes)."
The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.
"In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the double helix structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for DNA replication, writing, ""It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material""."
Arthur Eddington's observations made during a 1919 solar eclipse supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian gravitation.
"If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable."
Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a crucial experiment.
"If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to further testing."
The experimental control is a technique for dealing with observational error.
This technique uses the contrast between multiple samples (or observations) under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same.
"We vary the conditions for each measurement, to help isolate what has changed."
Mill's canons can then help us figure out what the important factor is.
Factor analysis is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.
"Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes."
"It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a double-blind study or an archaeological excavation."
Even taking a plane from New York to Paris is an experiment that tests the aerodynamical hypotheses used for constructing the plane.
Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment.
"Detailed record-keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure."
"They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others."
"Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of Hipparchus (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while controlled experiments can be seen in the works of Jābir ibn Hayyān (721–815 CE), al-Battani (853–929) and Alhazen (965–1039)."
Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content.
Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed X-ray diffraction images which showed an X-shape and was able to confirm the structure was helical.
This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure.
"At any stage, it is possible to refine its accuracy and precision, so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process."
Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration.
Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject.
"Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject."
Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage.
"They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions."
"Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else."
Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.
They were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by Linus Pauling and by Rosalind Franklin's X-ray diffraction images.
"Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community."
"Here, predictions from the hypothesis are central: if you assume the hypothesis to be true, what consequences follow?"
"If subsequent empirical investigation does not demonstrate that these consequences or predictions correspond to the observable world, the hypothesis can be concluded to be false."
"He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt, which he held to be fruitless."
It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion.
Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.
The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally.
"Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies present and past."
"The method of the a priori – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of ""what is agreeable to reason."""
Thereby it depends on fashion in paradigms and goes in circles over time.
"It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it."
"The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive – eventually – at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based."
"In that vein he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators would reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points."
"In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation."
"That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community."
"Thus, his theory of inquiry boils down to ""Do the science."""
Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.
"Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying."
"From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis."
"Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway)."
"All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon."
"Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong."
"But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the ""facile and natural"", as by Galileo's natural light of reason and as distinct from ""logical simplicity""."
Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference.
Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its testability and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.
"Peirce calls his pragmatism ""the logic of abduction""."
"His pragmatic maxim is: ""Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have."
"Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object""."
His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects – a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them.
"The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests."
"A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing."
"A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while subjective likelihood, though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive."
"Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as an example the game of Twenty Questions), breadth, and incomplexity."
"One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art."
"Unclearly premised, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible."
"Demonstration: Deductive argumentation, Euclidean in procedure."
"Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found."
"Corollarial or, if needed, theorematic."
The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real.
"Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree."
"Unclearly premised, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas."
Probation: direct inductive argumentation.
Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test).
"Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on weightings of qualities or characters; if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, or on statistics, or on countings."
"In particular, practices used within Big data, such as predictive analytics, may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method."
Such cooperation can be regarded as an important element of a scientific community.
Various standards of scientific methodology are used within such an environment.
"In certain journals, the journal itself selects the referees; while in others (especially journals that are extremely specialized), the manuscript author might recommend referees."
"The referees may or may not recommend publication, or they might recommend publication with suggested modifications, or sometimes, publication in another journal."
"This standard is practiced to various degrees by different journals, and can have the effect of keeping the literature free of obvious errors and to generally improve the quality of the material, especially in the journals who use the standard most rigorously."
"The peer-review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of ""groupthink"" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research."
"Occasionally because of this then, other scientists might attempt to repeat the experiments in order to duplicate the results."
"In these cases, detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses and source code can be preserved in order to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to reproduce the result."
"These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery."
"They might provide it, or if the author refuses to share data, appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research."
"This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned."
"For example, Heinrich Hertz did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results."
The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed in order to select and report the experimental conditions.
The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.
"There are basic assumptions, derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist, that form the base of the scientific method – namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world."
These assumptions from methodological naturalism form a basis on which science may be grounded.
"Logical Positivist, empiricist, falsificationist, and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science, but each has also itself been criticized."
"Thomas Kuhn examined the history of science in his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method."
His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.
"Norwood Russell Hanson, Imre Lakatos and Thomas Kuhn have done extensive work on the ""theory-laden"" character of observation."
"Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on the conceptual framework of the observer, using the concept of gestalt to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description."
"He opens Chapter 1 with a discussion of the Golgi bodies and their initial rejection as an artefact of staining technique, and a discussion of Brahe and Kepler observing the dawn and seeing a ""different"" sun rise despite the same physiological phenomenon."
Kuhn and Feyerabend acknowledge the pioneering significance of his work.
"Kuhn (1961) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations, and that the ""route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward""."
In his book Against Method he argues that scientific progress is not the result of applying any particular method.
"In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science."
"Thus, if believers in scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be 'anything goes'."
"Criticisms such as his led to the strong programme, a radical approach to the sociology of science."
The postmodernist critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy.
"This ongoing debate, known as the science wars, is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and realist camps."
"Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (note that this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, realists in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality."
Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.
This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.
"Louis Pasteur is credited with the famous saying that ""Luck favours the prepared mind"", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context."
Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.
"This is what Nassim Nicholas Taleb calls ""Anti-fragility""; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of human error, human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough – it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile)."
These unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they think is an error in their method.
"Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence."
"The highly controlled, cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors."
"At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise."
"A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps."
Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is known from what is unknown at each stage of discovery.
"Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be falsifiable (capable of disproof)."
"In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proven; at such a stage, that statement would be called a conjecture."
"For example, the technical concept of time arose in science, and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic."
"But today, the Poincaré conjecture has been proven using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see Ricci flow)."
"Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure."
"Eugene Wigner's paper, The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, is a very well known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist."
"In fact, some observers (including some well-known mathematicians such as Gregory Chaitin, and others such as Lakoff and Núñez) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science."
"George Pólya's work on problem solving, the construction of mathematical proofs, and heuristic show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail, while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps."
"In Pólya's view, understanding involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; analysis, which Pólya takes from Pappus, involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, working backward from the goal, and devising a plan for constructing the proof; synthesis is the strict Euclidean exposition of step-by-step details of the proof; review involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it."
"In like manner to science, where truth is sought, but certainty is not found, in Proofs and refutations (1976), what Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of informal mathematics is final or perfect."
"This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no counterexample has yet been found."
"an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity."
"This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations."
"logically true, by rewriting them, as did Poincaré (Proofs and Refutations, 1976).)"
Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on Polya's idea of heuristics.
"In Proofs and Refutations, Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures."
He thought that mathematical 'thought experiments' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs.
"This is described in a popular 2005 scientific paper ""Why Most Published Research Findings Are False"" by John Ioannidis, which is considered foundational to the field of metascience."
Much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use.
"The Scientific Revolution was a series of events that marked the emergence of modern science during the early modern period, when developments in mathematics, physics, astronomy, biology (including human anatomy) and chemistry transformed the views of society about nature."
"The Scientific Revolution took place in Europe towards the end of the Renaissance period and continued through the late 18th century, influencing the intellectual social movement known as the Enlightenment."
"The beginning of the Scientific Revolution, the 'Scientific Renaissance', was focused on the recovery of the knowledge of the ancients; this is generally considered to have ended in 1632 with publication of Galileo's Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems."
"The completion of the Scientific Revolution is attributed to the ""grand synthesis"" of Isaac Newton's 1687 Principia."
"The work formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology."
"By the end of the 18th century, the Age of Enlightenment that followed the Scientific Revolution had given way to the ""Age of Reflection""."
"In 1747, the French mathematician Alexis Clairaut wrote that ""Newton was said in his own life to have created a revolution""."
The word was also used in the preface to  Antoine Lavoisier's 1789 work announcing the discovery of oxygen.
"""In the 19th century, William Whewell described the revolution in science itself – the scientific method – that had taken place in the 15th-16th century."
"""Among the most conspicuous of the revolutions which opinions on this subject have undergone, is the transition from an implicit trust in the internal powers of man's mind to a professed dependence upon external observation; and from an unbounded reverence for the wisdom of the past, to a fervid expectation of change and improvement."""
"Science became an autonomous discipline, distinct from both philosophy and technology and came to be regarded as having utilitarian goals."
"The Scientific Revolution is traditionally assumed to start with the Copernican Revolution (initiated in 1543) and to be complete in the ""grand synthesis"" of Isaac Newton's 1687 Principia."
"Much of the change of attitude came from Francis Bacon whose ""confident and emphatic announcement"" in the modern progress of science inspired the creation of scientific societies such as the Royal Society, and Galileo who championed Copernicus and developed the science of motion."
"In the 20th century, Alexandre Koyré introduced the term ""scientific revolution"", centering his analysis on Galileo."
The term was popularized by Butterfield in his Origins of Modern Science.
"Thomas Kuhn's 1962 work The Structure of Scientific Revolutions emphasized that different theoretical frameworks—such as Einstein's theory of relativity and Newton's theory of gravity, which it replaced—cannot be directly compared without meaning loss."
"The new kind of scientific activity emerged only in a few countries of Western Europe, and it was restricted to that small area for about two hundred years."
Many contemporary writers and modern historians claim that there was a revolutionary change in world view.
"Not only were many of the key figures in the rise of science individuals with sincere religious commitments, but the new approaches to nature that they pioneered were underpinned in various ways by religious assumptions."
"Yet, many of the leading figures in the scientific revolution imagined themselves to be champions of a science that was more compatible with Christianity than the medieval ideas about the natural world that they replaced."
"Some scholars have noted a direct tie between ""particular aspects of traditional Christianity"" and the rise of science."
"The ""Aristotelian tradition"" was still an important intellectual framework in the 17th century, although by that time natural philosophers had moved away from much of it."
"Key scientific ideas dating back to classical antiquity had changed drastically over the years, and in many cases been discredited."
The terrestrial and celestial regions were made up of different elements which had different kinds of natural movement.
"The terrestrial region, according to Aristotle, consisted of concentric spheres of the four elements—earth, water, air, and fire."
All bodies naturally moved in straight lines until they reached the sphere appropriate to their elemental composition—their natural place.
"All other terrestrial motions were non-natural, or violent."
"The celestial region was made up of the fifth element, aether, which was unchanging and moved naturally with uniform circular motion."
"In the Aristotelian tradition, astronomical theories sought to explain the observed irregular motion of celestial objects through the combined effects of multiple uniform circular motions."
"The Ptolemaic model of planetary motion: based on the geometrical model of Eudoxus of Cnidus, Ptolemy's Almagest, demonstrated that calculations could compute the exact positions of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets in the future and in the past, and showed how these computational models were derived from astronomical observations."
As such they formed the model for later astronomical developments.
"Meanwhile, however, significant progress in geometry, mathematics, and astronomy was made in medieval times."
It is also true that many of the important figures of the Scientific Revolution shared in the general Renaissance respect for ancient learning and cited ancient pedigrees for their innovations.
"Nicolaus Copernicus (1473–1543), Galileo Galilei (1564–1642), Johannes Kepler (1571–1630) and Isaac Newton (1642–1727) all traced different ancient and medieval ancestries for the heliocentric system."
"In the Axioms Scholium of his Principia, Newton said its axiomatic three laws of motion were already accepted by mathematicians such as Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695), Wallace, Wren and others."
"Not only were there revolutionary theoretical and experimental developments, but that even more importantly, the way in which scientists worked was radically changed."
"For instance, although intimations of the concept of inertia are suggested sporadically in ancient discussion of motion, the salient point is that Newton's theory differed from ancient understandings in key ways, such as an external force being a requirement for violent motion in Aristotle's theory."
"The philosophy of using an inductive approach to obtain knowledge—to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe with an open mind—was in contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding."
"In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed—the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity."
"By the end of the Scientific Revolution the qualitative world of book-reading philosophers had been changed into a mechanical, mathematical world to be known through experimental research."
"Though it is certainly not true that Newtonian science was like modern science in all respects, it conceptually resembled ours in many ways."
"Many of the hallmarks of modern science, especially with regard to its institutionalization and professionalization, did not become standard until the mid-19th century."
"Coupled with this approach was the belief that rare events which seemed to contradict theoretical models were aberrations, telling nothing about nature as it ""naturally"" was."
"During the Scientific Revolution, changing perceptions about the role of the scientist in respect to nature, the value of evidence, experimental or observed, led towards a scientific methodology in which empiricism played a large, but not absolute, role."
"By the start of the Scientific Revolution, empiricism had already become an important component of science and natural philosophy."
"Thomas Hobbes, George Berkeley, and David Hume were the philosophy's primary exponents, who developed a sophisticated empirical tradition as the basis of human knowledge."
"An influential formulation of empiricism was John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689), in which he maintained that the only true knowledge that could be accessible to the human mind was that which was based on experience."
"He wrote that the human mind was created as a tabula rasa, a ""blank tablet,"" upon which sensory impressions were recorded and built up knowledge through a process of reflection."
"His works established and popularised inductive methodologies for scientific inquiry, often called the Baconian method, or simply the scientific method."
"His demand for a planned procedure of investigating all things natural marked a new turn in the rhetorical and theoretical framework for science, much of which still surrounds conceptions of proper methodology today."
"Bacon proposed a great reformation of all process of knowledge for the advancement of learning divine and human, which he called Instauratio Magna (The Great Instauration)."
"For Bacon, this reformation would lead to a great advancement in science and a progeny of new inventions that would relieve mankind's miseries and needs."
"He argued that man is ""the minister and interpreter of nature"", that ""knowledge and human power are synonymous"", that ""effects are produced by the means of instruments and helps"", and that ""man while operating can only apply or withdraw natural bodies; nature internally performs the rest"", and later that ""nature can only be commanded by obeying her""."
"Here is an abstract of the philosophy of this work, that by the knowledge of nature and the using of instruments, man can govern or direct the natural work of nature to produce definite results."
"Therefore, that man, by seeking knowledge of nature, can reach power over it—and thus reestablish the ""Empire of Man over creation"", which had been lost by the Fall together with man's original purity."
"For him, the philosopher should proceed through inductive reasoning from fact to axiom to physical law."
"Before beginning this induction, though, the enquirer must free his or her mind from certain false notions or tendencies which distort the truth."
"In particular, he found that philosophy was too preoccupied with words, particularly discourse and debate, rather than actually observing the material world: ""For while men believe their reason governs words, in fact, words turn back and reflect their power upon the understanding, and so render philosophy and science sophistical and inactive."
"""Bacon considered that it is of greatest importance to science not to keep doing intellectual discussions or seeking merely contemplative aims, but that it should work for the bettering of mankind's life by bringing forth new inventions, having even stated that ""inventions are also, as it were, new creations and imitations of divine works""."
"He explored the far-reaching and world-changing character of inventions, such as the printing press, gunpowder and the compass."
"Despite his influence on scientific methodology, he himself rejected correct novel theories such as William Gilbert's magnetism, Copernicus's heliocentrism, and Kepler's  laws of planetary motion."
"There remains simple experience; which, if taken as it comes, is called accident, if sought for, experiment."
"The true method of experience first lights the candle [hypothesis], and then by means of the candle shows the way [arranges and delimits the experiment]; commencing as it does with experience duly ordered and digested, not bungling or erratic, and from it deducing axioms [theories], and from established axioms again new experiments."
William Gilbert was an early advocate of this method.
He passionately rejected both the prevailing Aristotelian philosophy and the Scholastic method of university teaching.
"His book De Magnete was written in 1600, and he is regarded by some as the father of electricity and magnetism."
"In this work, he describes many of his experiments with his model Earth called the terrella."
"From these experiments, he concluded that the Earth was itself magnetic and that this was the reason compasses point north."
"De Magnete was influential not only because of the inherent interest of its subject matter, but also for the rigorous way in which Gilbert described his experiments and his rejection of ancient theories of magnetism."
"It is the more remarkable, because it preceded the Novum Organum of Bacon, in which the inductive method of philosophizing was first explained."
"""Galileo Galilei has been called the ""father of modern observational astronomy"", the ""father of modern physics"", the ""father of science"", and ""the Father of Modern Science""."
His original contributions to the science of motion were made through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics.
Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical.
He ignored Aristotelianism.
"In broader terms, his work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion; a major development in human thought."
He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation.
"In order to perform his experiments, Galileo had to set up standards of length and time, so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion."
This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning.
"Galileo showed an appreciation for the relationship between mathematics, theoretical physics, and experimental physics."
"He understood the parabola, both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate (y) varying as the square of the abscissa (x)."
Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of friction and other disturbances.
"He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory, noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola, but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day, the deviation of a projectile's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight."
"To the extent that medieval natural philosophers used mathematical problems, they limited social studies to theoretical analyses of local speed and other aspects of life."
"It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth."
"The final cause was the aim, goal, or purpose of some natural process or man-made thing."
"Until the Scientific Revolution, it was very natural to see such aims, such as a child's growth, for example, leading to a mature adult."
Intelligence was assumed only in the purpose of man-made artifacts; it was not attributed to other animals or to nature.
"In ""mechanical philosophy"" no field or action at a distance is permitted, particles or corpuscles of matter are fundamentally inert."
Motion is caused by direct physical collision.
"Where natural substances had previously been understood organically, the mechanical philosophers viewed them as machines."
"As a result, Isaac Newton's theory seemed like some kind of throwback to ""spooky action at a distance""."
"Innate attractions and repulsions joined size, shape, position and motion as physically irreducible primary properties of matter."
"Newton had also specifically attributed the inherent power of inertia to matter, against the mechanist thesis that matter has no inherent powers."
"But whereas Newton vehemently denied gravity was an inherent power of matter, his collaborator Roger Cotes made gravity also an inherent power of matter, as set out in his famous preface to the Principia's 1713 second edition which he edited, and contradicted Newton himself."
And it was Cotes's interpretation of gravity rather than Newton's that came to be accepted.
The first scientific society to be established was the Royal Society of London.
"This grew out of an earlier group, centred around Gresham College in the 1640s and 1650s."
"These physicians and natural philosophers were influenced by the ""new science"", as promoted by Francis Bacon in his New Atlantis, from approximately 1645 onwards."
"At the second meeting, Robert Moray announced that the King approved of the gatherings, and a Royal charter was signed on 15 July 1662 creating the ""Royal Society of London"", with Lord Brouncker serving as the first President."
"A second Royal Charter was signed on 23 April 1663, with the King noted as the Founder and with the name of ""the Royal Society of London for the Improvement of Natural Knowledge""; Robert Hooke was appointed as Curator of Experiments in November."
"This initial royal favour has continued, and since then every monarch has been the patron of the Society."
The Society's first Secretary was Henry Oldenburg.
"Its early meetings included experiments performed first by Robert Hooke and then by Denis Papin, who was appointed in 1684."
"These experiments varied in their subject area, and were both important in some cases and trivial in others."
"In contrast to the private origins of its British counterpart, the Academy was founded as a government body by Jean-Baptiste Colbert."
"Its rules were set down in 1699 by King Louis XIV, when it received the name of 'Royal Academy of Sciences' and was installed in the Louvre in Paris."
Many of them were revolutions in their own fields.
"In Aristotle's cosmology, Earth's central location was perhaps less significant than its identification as a realm of imperfection, inconstancy, irregularity and change, as opposed to the ""heavens"" (Moon, Sun, planets, stars), which were regarded as perfect, permanent, unchangeable, and in religious thought, the realm of heavenly beings."
"The Earth was even composed of different material, the four elements ""earth"", ""water"", ""fire"", and ""air"", while sufficiently far above its surface (roughly the Moon's orbit), the heavens were composed of different substance called ""aether""."
"The heliocentric model that replaced it involved not only the radical displacement of the earth to an orbit around the sun, but its sharing a placement with the other planets implied a universe of heavenly components made from the same changeable substances as the Earth."
"Heavenly motions no longer needed to be governed by a theoretical perfection, confined to circular orbits."
Copernicus' 1543 work on the heliocentric model of the solar system tried to demonstrate that the sun was the center of the universe.
"Few were bothered by this suggestion, and the pope and several archbishops were interested enough by it to want more detail."
His model was later used to create the calendar of Pope Gregory XIII.
"However, the idea that the earth moved around the sun was doubted by most of Copernicus' contemporaries."
"It contradicted not only empirical observation, due to the absence of an observable stellar parallax, but more significantly at the time, the authority of Aristotle."
The discoveries of Johannes Kepler and Galileo gave the theory credibility.
"Kepler was an astronomer who, using the accurate observations of Tycho Brahe, proposed that the planets move around the sun not in circular orbits, but in elliptical ones."
"Together with his other laws of planetary motion, this allowed him to create a model of the solar system that was an improvement over Copernicus' original system."
"Galileo's main contributions to the acceptance of the heliocentric system were his mechanics, the observations he made with his telescope, as well as his detailed presentation of the case for the system."
"Using an early theory of inertia, Galileo could explain why rocks dropped from a tower fall straight down even if the earth rotates."
"His observations of the moons of Jupiter, the phases of Venus, the spots on the sun, and mountains on the moon all helped to discredit the Aristotelian philosophy and the Ptolemaic theory of the solar system."
"Through their combined discoveries, the heliocentric system gained support, and at the end of the 17th century it was generally accepted by astronomers."
This work culminated in the work of Isaac Newton.
"Newton's Principia formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, which dominated scientists' view of the physical universe for the next three centuries."
"By deriving Kepler's laws of planetary motion from his mathematical description of gravity, and then using the same principles to account for the trajectories of comets, the tides, the precession of the equinoxes, and other phenomena, Newton removed the last doubts about the validity of the heliocentric model of the cosmos."
This work also demonstrated that the motion of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies could be described by the same principles.
His prediction that the Earth should be shaped as an oblate spheroid was later vindicated by other scientists.
His laws of motion were to be the solid foundation of mechanics; his law of universal gravitation combined terrestrial and celestial mechanics into one great system that seemed to be able to describe the whole world in mathematical formulae.
"In 1679, Newton began to consider gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion."
"This followed stimulation by a brief exchange of letters in 1679–80 with Robert Hooke, who had been appointed to manage the Royal Society's correspondence, and who opened a correspondence intended to elicit contributions from Newton to Royal Society transactions."
"Newton's reawakening interest in astronomical matters received further stimulus by the appearance of a comet in the winter of 1680–1681, on which he corresponded with John Flamsteed."
"After the exchanges with Hooke, Newton worked out proof that the elliptical form of planetary orbits would result from a centripetal force inversely proportional to the square of the radius vector (see Newton's law of universal gravitation – History and De motu corporum in gyrum)."
"Newton communicated his results to Edmond Halley and to the Royal Society in De motu corporum in gyrum, in 1684."
"In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion that contributed to many advances during the Industrial Revolution which soon followed and were not to be improved upon for more than 200 years."
Many of these advancements continue to be the underpinnings of non-relativistic technologies in the modern world.
"He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation."
"Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing ""occult agencies"" into science."
"Later, in the second edition of the Principia (1713), Newton firmly rejected such criticisms in a concluding General Scholium, writing that it was enough that the phenomena implied a gravitational attraction, as they did; but they did not so far indicate its cause, and it was both unnecessary and improper to frame hypotheses of things that were not implied by the phenomena."
The Flemish scholar Vesalius demonstrated mistakes in the Galen's ideas.
"Vesalius dissected human corpses, whereas Galen dissected animal corpses."
"Published in 1543, Vesalius' De humani corporis fabrica was a groundbreaking work of human anatomy."
"It emphasized the priority of dissection and what has come to be called the ""anatomical"" view of the body, seeing human internal functioning as an essentially corporeal structure filled with organs arranged in three-dimensional space."
"This was in stark contrast to many of the anatomical models used previously, which had strong Galenic/Aristotelean elements, as well as elements of astrology."
"Besides the first good description of the sphenoid bone, he showed that the sternum consists of three portions and the sacrum of five or six; and described accurately the vestibule in the interior of the temporal bone."
"He not only verified the observation of Etienne on the valves of the hepatic veins, but he described the vena azygos, and discovered the canal which passes in the fetus between the umbilical vein and the vena cava, since named ductus venosus."
"Before Vesalius, the anatomical notes by Alessandro Achillini demonstrate a detailed description of the human body and compares what he has found during his dissections to what others like Galen and Avicenna have found and notes their similarities and differences."
"Niccolò Massa was an Italian anatomist who wrote an early anatomy text Anatomiae Libri Introductorius in 1536, described the cerebrospinal fluid and was the author of several medical works."
"Jean Fernel was a French physician who introduced the term ""physiology"" to describe the study of the body's function and was the first person to describe the spinal canal."
"Further groundbreaking work was carried out by William Harvey, who published De Motu Cordis in 1628."
"Harvey made a detailed analysis of the overall structure of the heart, going on to an analysis of the arteries, showing how their pulsation depends upon the contraction of the left ventricle, while the contraction of the right ventricle propels its charge of blood into the pulmonary artery."
He noticed that the two ventricles move together almost simultaneously and not independently like had been thought previously by his predecessors.
"In the eighth chapter, Harvey estimated the capacity of the heart, how much blood is expelled through each pump of the heart, and the number of times the heart beats in half an hour."
"From these estimations, he demonstrated that according to Gaelen's theory that blood was continually produced in the liver, the absurdly large figure of 540 pounds of blood would have to be produced every day."
"Having this simple mathematical proportion at hand—which would imply a seemingly impossible role for the liver—Harvey went on to demonstrate how the blood circulated in a circle by means of countless experiments initially done on serpents and fish: tying their veins and arteries in separate periods of time, Harvey noticed the modifications which occurred; indeed, as he tied the veins, the heart would become empty, while as he did the same to the arteries, the organ would swell up."
This process was later performed on the human body (in the image on the left): the physician tied a tight ligature onto the upper arm of a person.
This would cut off blood flow from the arteries and the veins.
"When this was done, the arm below the ligature was cool and pale, while above the ligature it was warm and swollen."
"The ligature was loosened slightly, which allowed blood from the arteries to come into the arm, since arteries are deeper in the flesh than the veins."
"When this was done, the opposite effect was seen in the lower arm."
It was now warm and swollen.
"The veins were also more visible, since now they were full of blood."
Various other advances in medical understanding and practice were made.
"French physician Pierre Fauchard started dentistry science as we know it today, and he has been named ""the father of modern dentistry""."
The importance of chemistry is indicated by the range of important scholars who actively engaged in chemical research.
"Among them were the astronomer Tycho Brahe, the chemical physician Paracelsus, Robert Boyle, Thomas Browne and Isaac Newton."
"His work describes the highly developed and complex processes of mining metal ores, metal extraction and metallurgy of the time."
"Although his research clearly has its roots in the alchemical tradition, Boyle is largely regarded today as the first modern chemist, and therefore one of the founders of modern chemistry, and one of the pioneers of modern experimental scientific method."
"In the work, Boyle presents his hypothesis that every phenomenon was the result of collisions of particles in motion."
"Boyle appealed to chemists to experiment and asserted that experiments denied the limiting of chemical elements to only the classic four: earth, fire, air, and water."
"He also pleaded that chemistry should cease to be subservient to medicine or to alchemy, and rise to the status of a science."
"Importantly, he advocated a rigorous approach to scientific experiment: he believed all theories must be tested experimentally before being regarded as true."
"The work contains some of the earliest modern ideas of atoms, molecules, and chemical reaction, and marks the beginning of the history of modern chemistry."
Johannes Kepler published Astronomiae Pars Optica (The Optical Part of Astronomy) in 1604.
"In it, he described the inverse-square law governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of pinhole cameras, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as parallax and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies."
the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the rainbow's centre is 42°).
"He also independently discovered the law of reflection, and his essay on optics was the first published mention of this law."
"These included the Opera reliqua (also known as Christiani Hugenii Zuilichemii, dum viveret Zelhemii toparchae, opuscula posthuma) and the Traité de la lumière."
"Isaac Newton investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light."
He also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects.
"Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour."
"Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves."
This is known as Newton's theory of colour.
From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours.
The interest of the Royal Society encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour (later expanded into Opticks).
"Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles and were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light."
"In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles."
"In 1704, Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light."
"Gilbert also discovered that a heated body lost its electricity and that moisture prevented the electrification of all bodies, due to the now well-known fact that moisture impaired the insulation of such bodies."
"He also noticed that electrified substances attracted all other substances indiscriminately, whereas a magnet only attracted iron."
The many discoveries of this nature earned for Gilbert the title of founder of the electrical science.
"By investigating the forces on a light metallic needle, balanced on a point, he extended the list of electric bodies, and found also that many substances, including metals and natural magnets, showed no attractive forces when rubbed."
He left a detailed account of his researches under the title of Experiments on the Origin of Electricity.
"Boyle, in 1675, stated that electric attraction and repulsion can act across a vacuum."
"One of his important discoveries was that electrified bodies in a vacuum would attract light substances, this indicating that the electrical effect did not depend upon the air as a medium."
"By the end of the 17th century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction with an electrostatic generator, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity."
"The first usage of the word electricity is ascribed to Sir Thomas Browne in his 1646 work, Pseudodoxia Epidemica."
With the help of the prominent mathematician Henry Briggs their logarithmic tables embodied a computational advance that made calculations by hand much quicker.
His Napier's bones used a set of numbered rods as a multiplication tool using the system of lattice multiplication.
"The way was opened to later scientific advances, particularly in astronomy and dynamics."
"At Oxford University, Edmund Gunter built the first analog device to aid computation."
"The 'Gunter's scale' was a large plane scale, engraved with various scales, or lines."
"Natural lines, such as the line of chords, the line of sines and tangents are placed on one side of the scale and the corresponding artificial or logarithmic ones were on the other side."
This calculating aid was a predecessor of the slide rule.
The introduction of his Pascaline in 1645 launched the development of mechanical calculators first in Europe and then all over the world.
He developed a method of producing high-grade iron in a blast furnace fueled by coke rather than charcoal.
This was a major step forward in the production of iron as a raw material for the Industrial Revolution.
"The inventor is unknown but Hans Lippershey applied for the first patent, followed by Jacob Metius of Alkmaar."
"He argued that a mirror shaped like the part of a conic section, would correct the spherical aberration that flawed the accuracy of refracting telescopes."
"His design, the ""Gregorian telescope"", however, remained un-built."
"In 1666, Isaac Newton argued that the faults of the refracting telescope were fundamental because the lens refracted light of different colors differently."
He concluded that light could not be refracted through a lens without causing chromatic aberrations.
From these experiments Newton concluded that no improvement could be made in the refracting telescope.
"However, he was able to demonstrate that the angle of reflection remained the same for all colors, so he decided to build a reflecting telescope."
These were successfully demonstrated to the Royal Society.
The first such device was made by Otto von Guericke in 1654.
It consisted of a piston and an air gun cylinder with flaps that could suck the air from any vessel that it was connected to.
"In 1657, he pumped the air out of two conjoined hemispheres and demonstrated that a team of sixteen horses were incapable of pulling it apart."
The motivation for the invention was to improve on the suction pumps that were used to raise water out of the mines.
"Torricelli constructed a sealed tube filled with mercury, set vertically into a basin of the same substance."
"The column of mercury fell downwards, leaving a Torricellian vacuum above."
"Those instruments that exist in collections today tend to be robust examples, made by skilled craftspeople for and at the expense of wealthy patrons."
These may have been commissioned as displays of wealth.
"In addition, the instruments preserved in collections may not have received heavy use in scientific work; instruments that had visibly received heavy use were typically destroyed, deemed unfit for display, or excluded from collections altogether."
"The pump at right included a glass sphere to permit demonstrations inside the vacuum chamber, a common use."
"The base was wooden, and the cylindrical pump was brass."
"The increase in uses for such instruments, and their widespread use in global exploration and conflict, created a need for new methods of manufacture and repair, which would be met by the Industrial Revolution."
He found that the circulation of blood resolved from pumping of the heart.
He also assembled the first human skeleton from cutting open cadavers.
"The French mathematician François Viète (1540–1603) published In Artem Analycitem Isagoge (1591), which gave the first symbolic notation of parameters in literal algebra."
These became the basic data for Kepler's studies.
This contributed to the development of what became known as the scientific method.
He developed the laws for falling bodies based on pioneering quantitative experiments which he analyzed mathematically.
"He showed that an inverse square law for gravity explained the elliptical orbits of the planets, and advanced the law of universal gravitation."
His development of infinitesimal calculus (along with Leibniz) opened up new applications of the methods of mathematics to science.
"Newton taught that scientific theory should be coupled with rigorous experimentation, which became the keystone of modern science."
"A weakness of the idea of scientific revolution is the lack of a systematic approach to the question of knowledge in the period comprehended between the 14th and 17th centuries, leading to misunderstandings on the value and role of modern authors."
"Thus, the idea of a scientific revolution following the Renaissance is—according to the continuity thesis—a myth."
"Bala proposes that the changes involved in the Scientific Revolution—the mathematical realist turn, the mechanical philosophy, the atomism, the central role assigned to the Sun in Copernican heliocentrism—have to be seen as rooted in multicultural influences on Europe."
"In the ultimate analysis, even if the revolution was rooted upon a multicultural base it is the accomplishment of Europeans in Europe."""
A closer study of Greek philosophy and Greek mathematics demonstrates that nearly all of the so-called revolutionary results of the so-called scientific revolution were in actuality restatements of ideas that were in many cases older than those of Aristotle and in nearly all cases at least as old as Archimedes.
"Aristotle even explicitly argues against some of the ideas that were espoused during the Scientific Revolution, such as heliocentrism."
"The basic ideas of the scientific method were well known to Archimedes and his contemporaries, as demonstrated in the well-known discovery of buoyancy."
Atomism was first thought of by Leucippus and Democritus.
This approach to the Scientific Revolution reduces it to a period of relearning classical ideas that is very much an extension of the Renaissance.
This view does not deny that a change occurred but argues that it was a reassertion of previous knowledge (a renaissance) and not the creation of new knowledge.
"Female scholars were not always given the opportunities that a male scholar would have had, and the incorporation of women's work in the sciences during this time tends to be obscured."
"Scholars have tried to look into the participation of women in the 17th century in science, and even with sciences as simple as domestic knowledge women were making advances."
With the limited history provided from texts of the period we are not completely aware if women were helping these scientists develop the ideas they did.
Another idea to consider is the way this period influenced even the women scientists of the periods following it.
Annie Jump Cannon was an astronomer who benefitted from the laws and theories developed from this period; she made several advances in the century following the Scientific Revolution.
"It was an important period for the future of science, including the incorporation of women into fields using the developments made."
Social science is the branch of science devoted to the study of societies and the relationships among individuals within those societies.
"The term was formerly used to refer to the field of sociology, the original ""science of society"", established in the  century."
"In addition to sociology, it now encompasses a wide array of academic disciplines, including anthropology, archaeology, economics, human geography, linguistics, management science, media studies, political science, psychology, and history."
(For a more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences see: Outline of social science.)
"Positivist social scientists use methods resembling those of the natural sciences as tools for understanding society, and so define science in its stricter modern sense."
"Interpretivist social scientists, by contrast, may use social critique or symbolic interpretation rather than constructing empirically falsifiable theories, and thus treat science in its broader sense."
"In modern academic practice, researchers are often eclectic, using multiple methodologies (for instance, by combining both quantitative and qualitative research)."
"The term ""social research"" has also acquired a degree of autonomy as practitioners from various disciplines share the same aims and methods."
"Social sciences came forth from the moral philosophy of the time and were influenced by the Age of Revolutions, such as the Industrial Revolution and the French Revolution."
The growth of the social sciences is also reflected in other specialized encyclopedias.
"The modern period saw ""social science"" first used as a distinct conceptual field."
"Social science was influenced by positivism, focusing on knowledge based on actual positive sense experience and avoiding the negative; metaphysical speculation was avoided."
One route that was taken was the rise of social research.
Large statistical surveys were undertaken in various parts of the United States and Europe.
"Another route undertaken was initiated by Émile Durkheim, studying ""social facts"", and Vilfredo Pareto, opening metatheoretical ideas and individual theories."
"A third means developed, arising from the methodological dichotomy present, in which social phenomena were identified with and understood; this was championed by figures such as Max Weber."
"The fourth route taken, based in economics, was developed and furthered economic knowledge as a hard science."
The last path was the correlation of knowledge and social values; the antipositivism and verstehen sociology of Max Weber firmly demanded this distinction.
"In this route, theory (description) and prescription were non-overlapping formal discussions of a subject."
The foundation of social sciences in the West implies conditioned relationships between progressive and traditional spheres of knowledge.
"In some contexts, such as the Italian one, sociology slowly affirms itself and experiences the difficulty of affirming a strategic knowledge beyond philosophy and theology (Cfr."
"Around the start of the 20th century, Enlightenment philosophy was challenged in various quarters."
"After the use of classical theories since the end of the scientific revolution, various fields substituted mathematics studies for experimental studies and examining equations to build a theoretical structure."
The development of social science subfields became very quantitative in methodology.
"The interdisciplinary and cross-disciplinary nature of scientific inquiry into human behaviour, social and environmental factors affecting it, made many of the natural sciences interested in some aspects of social science methodology."
"Examples of boundary blurring include emerging disciplines like social research of medicine, sociobiology, neuropsychology, bioeconomics and the history and sociology of science."
"Increasingly, quantitative research and qualitative methods are being integrated in the study of human action and its implications and consequences."
"In the first half of the 20th century, statistics became a free-standing discipline of applied mathematics."
Statistical methods were used confidently.
"In the contemporary period, Karl Popper and Talcott Parsons influenced the furtherance of the social sciences."
"Researchers continue to search for a unified consensus on what methodology might have the power and refinement to connect a proposed ""grand theory"" with the various midrange theories that, with considerable success, continue to provide usable frameworks for massive, growing data banks; for more, see consilience."
"Social science disciplines are defined and recognized by the academic journals in which research is published, and the learned social science societies and academic departments or faculties to which their practitioners belong."
"Social science fields of study usually have several sub-disciplines or branches, and the distinguishing lines between these are often both arbitrary and ambiguous."
"The discipline deals with the integration of different aspects of the social sciences, humanities, and human biology."
"In the twentieth century, academic disciplines have often been institutionally divided into three broad domains."
The natural sciences seek to derive general laws through reproducible and verifiable experiments.
"The humanities generally study local traditions, through their history, literature, music, and arts, with an emphasis on understanding particular individuals, events, or eras."
"The social sciences have generally attempted to develop scientific methods to understand social phenomena in a generalizable way, though usually with methods distinct from those of the natural sciences."
"The anthropological social sciences often develop nuanced descriptions rather than the general laws derived in physics or chemistry, or they may explain individual cases through more general principles, as in many fields of psychology."
"Anthropology (like some fields of history) does not easily fit into one of these categories, and different branches of anthropology draw on one or more of these domains."
"Within the United States, anthropology is divided into four sub-fields: archaeology, physical or biological anthropology, anthropological linguistics, and cultural anthropology."
It is an area that is offered at most undergraduate institutions.
"Eric Wolf described sociocultural anthropology as ""the most scientific of the humanities, and the most humanistic of the sciences""."
The goal of anthropology is to provide a holistic account of humans and human nature.
"This means that, though anthropologists generally specialize in only one sub-field, they always keep in mind the biological, linguistic, historic and cultural aspects of any problem."
"Since anthropology arose as a science in Western societies that were complex and industrial, a major trend within anthropology has been a methodological drive to study peoples in societies with more simple social organization, sometimes called ""primitive"" in anthropological literature, but without any connotation of ""inferior""."
"Today, anthropologists use terms such as ""less complex"" societies or refer to specific modes of subsistence or production, such as ""pastoralist"" or ""forager"" or ""horticulturalist"" to refer to humans living in non-industrial, non-Western cultures, such people or folk (ethnos) remaining of great interest within anthropology."
"The quest for holism leads most anthropologists to study a people in detail, using biogenetic, archaeological, and linguistic data alongside direct observation of contemporary customs."
"In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were heard."
"It is possible to view all human cultures as part of one large, evolving global culture."
"These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological."
"The discipline encompasses a range of topics, from face-to-face conversation to mass media outlets such as television broadcasting."
"Communication studies also examines how messages are interpreted through the political, cultural, economic, and social dimensions of their contexts."
"Communication is institutionalized under many different names at different universities, including ""communication"", ""communication studies"", ""speech communication"", ""rhetorical studies"", ""communication science"", ""media studies"", ""communication arts"", ""mass communication"", ""media ecology"", and ""communication and media science""."
Communication studies integrates aspects of both social sciences and the humanities.
"As a social science, the discipline often overlaps with sociology, psychology, anthropology, biology, political science, economics, and public policy, among others."
"From a humanities perspective, communication is concerned with rhetoric and persuasion (traditional graduate programs in communication studies trace their history to the rhetoricians of Ancient Greece)."
"The field applies to outside disciplines as well, including engineering, architecture, mathematics, and information science."
"An economist is a person using economic concepts and data in the course of employment, or someone who has earned a degree in the subject."
"The classic brief definition of economics, set out by Lionel Robbins in 1932, is ""the science which studies human behavior as a relation between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses""."
"Without scarcity and alternative uses, there is no economic problem."
"Briefer yet is ""the study of how people seek to satisfy needs and wants"" and ""the study of the financial aspects of human behavior""."
"Economics has two broad branches: microeconomics, where the unit of analysis is the individual agent, such as a household or firm, and macroeconomics, where the unit of analysis is an economy as a whole."
"Another division of the subject distinguishes positive economics, which seeks to predict and explain economic phenomena, from normative economics, which orders choices and actions by some criterion; such orderings necessarily involve subjective value judgments."
"Since the early part of the 20th century, economics has focused largely on measurable quantities, employing both theoretical models and empirical analysis."
"Quantitative models, however, can be traced as far back as the physiocratic school."
"Economic reasoning has been increasingly applied in recent decades to other social situations such as politics, law, psychology, history, religion, marriage and family life, and other social interactions."
"This paradigm crucially assumes that resources are scarce because they are not sufficient to satisfy all wants, and that ""economic value"" is willingness to pay as revealed for instance by market (arms' length) transactions."
"Rival heterodox schools of thought, such as institutional economics, green economics, Marxist economics, and economic sociology, make other grounding assumptions."
"For example, Marxist economics assumes that economics primarily deals with the investigation of exchange value, of which human labour is the source."
The expanding domain of economics in the social sciences has been described as economic imperialism.
Education has as one of its fundamental rights the imparting of culture from generation to generation (see socialization).
"To educate means 'to draw out', from the Latin educare, or to facilitate the realization of an individual's potential and talents."
"The former focuses largely on the built environment and how space is created, viewed and managed by humans as well as the influence humans have on the space they occupy."
"This may involve cultural geography, transportation, health, military operations, and cities."
"The latter examines the natural environment and how the climate, vegetation and life, soil, oceans, water and landforms are produced and interact."
Physical geography examines phenomena related to the measurement of earth.
"As a result of the two subfields using different approaches a third field has emerged, which is environmental geography."
Environmental geography combines physical and human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans.
"Other branches of geography include social geography, regional geography, and geomatics."
Geographers attempt to understand the Earth in terms of physical and spatial relationships.
The first geographers focused on the science of mapmaking and finding ways to precisely project the surface of the earth.
"In this sense, geography bridges some gaps between the natural sciences and social sciences."
Historical geography is often taught in a college in a unified Department of Geography.
"Modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline, closely related to GISc, that seeks to understand humanity and its natural environment."
"The fields of urban planning, regional science, and planetology are closely related to geography."
"Practitioners of geography use many technologies and methods to collect data such as GIS, remote sensing, aerial photography, statistics, and global positioning systems (GPS)."
History has a base in both the social sciences and the humanities.
In the United States the National Endowment for the Humanities includes history in its definition of humanities (as it does for applied linguistics).
"However, the National Research Council classifies history as a social science."
The historical method comprises the techniques and guidelines by which historians use primary sources and other evidence to research and then to write history.
"The Social Science History Association, formed in 1976, brings together scholars from numerous disciplines interested in social history."
"However, many laws are based on norms accepted by a community and thus have an ethical foundation."
"The study of law crosses the boundaries between the social sciences and humanities, depending on one's view of research into its objectives and effects."
"Law is not always enforceable, especially in the international relations context."
"It has been defined as a ""system of rules"", as an ""interpretive concept"" to achieve justice, as an ""authority"" to mediate people's interests, and even as ""the command of a sovereign, backed by the threat of a sanction""."
"However one likes to think of law, it is a completely central social institution."
Legal policy incorporates the practical manifestation of thinking from almost every social science and the humanities.
"And law is economics, because any rule about contract, tort, property law, labour law, company law and many more can have long-lasting effects on the distribution of wealth."
"The noun law derives from the late Old English lagu, meaning something laid down or fixed and the adjective legal comes from the Latin word lex."
"The field is divided into areas that focus on aspects of the linguistic signal, such as syntax (the study of the rules that govern the structure of sentences), semantics (the study of meaning), morphology (the study of the structure of words), phonetics (the study of speech sounds) and phonology (the study of the abstract sound system of a particular language); however, work in areas like evolutionary linguistics (the study of the origins and evolution of language) and psycholinguistics (the study of psychological factors in human language) cut across these divisions."
"The overwhelming majority of modern research in linguistics takes a predominantly synchronic perspective (focusing on language at a particular point in time), and a great deal of it—partly owing to the influence of Noam Chomsky—aims at formulating theories of the cognitive processing of language."
"However, language does not exist in a vacuum, or only in the brain, and approaches like contact linguistics, creole studies, discourse analysis, social interactional linguistics, and sociolinguistics explore language in its social context."
"Sociolinguistics often makes use of traditional quantitative analysis and statistics in investigating the frequency of features, while some disciplines, like contact linguistics, focus on qualitative analysis."
"While certain areas of linguistics can thus be understood as clearly falling within the social sciences, other areas, like acoustic phonetics and neurolinguistics, draw on the natural sciences."
"Linguistics draws only secondarily on the humanities, which played a rather greater role in linguistic inquiry in the 19th and early 20th centuries."
Ferdinand Saussure is considered the father of modern linguistics.
"Fields and subfields of political science include political economy, political theory and philosophy, civics and comparative politics, theory of direct democracy, apolitical governance, participatory direct democracy, national systems, cross-national political analysis, political development, international relations, foreign policy, international law, politics, public administration, administrative behaviour, public law, judicial behaviour, and public policy."
"Approaches to the discipline include rational choice, classical political philosophy, interpretivism, structuralism, and behaviouralism, realism, pluralism, and institutionalism."
"Political science, as one of the social sciences, uses methods and techniques that relate to the kinds of inquiries sought: primary sources such as historical documents, interviews, and official records, as well as secondary sources such as scholarly articles are used in building and testing theories."
"Empirical methods include survey research, statistical analysis or econometrics, case studies, experiments, and model building."
"Herbert Baxter Adams is credited with coining the phrase ""political science"" while teaching history at Johns Hopkins University."
"Psychology also refers to the application of such knowledge to various spheres of human activity, including problems of individuals' daily lives and the treatment of mental illness."
"In practice, however, there is quite a lot of cross-fertilization that takes place among the various fields."
"Psychology differs from biology and neuroscience in that it is primarily concerned with the interaction of mental processes and behaviour, and of the overall processes of a system, and not simply the biological or neural processes themselves, though the subfield of neuropsychology combines the study of the actual neural processes with the study of the mental effects they have subjectively produced."
"Many people associate psychology with clinical psychology, which focuses on assessment and treatment of problems in living and psychopathology."
"In reality, psychology has myriad specialties including social psychology, developmental psychology, cognitive psychology, educational psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, mathematical psychology, neuropsychology, and quantitative analysis of behaviour."
"Psychology is a very broad science that is rarely tackled as a whole, major block."
"Although some subfields encompass a natural science base and a social science application, others can be clearly distinguished as having little to do with the social sciences or having a lot to do with the social sciences."
"follow the same curriculum as outlined by The British Psychological Society and have the same options of specialism open to them regardless of whether they choose a balance, a heavy science basis, or heavy social science basis to their degree."
"The meaning of the word comes from the suffix ""-logy"", which means ""study of"", derived from Ancient Greek, and the stem ""soci-"", which is from the Latin word socius, meaning ""companion"", or society in general."
"Comte endeavoured to unify history, psychology and economics through the descriptive understanding of the social realm."
"He proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism, an epistemological approach outlined in The Course in Positive Philosophy [1830–1842] and A General View of Positivism (1844)."
"Though Comte is generally regarded as the ""Father of Sociology"", the discipline was formally established by another French thinker, Émile Durkheim (1858–1917), who developed positivism as a foundation to practical social research."
"Durkheim set up the first European department of sociology at the University of Bordeaux in 1895, publishing his Rules of the Sociological Method."
"Around the start of the 20th century, the first wave of German sociologists, including Max Weber and Georg Simmel, developed sociological antipositivism."
The field may be broadly recognized as an amalgam of three modes of social thought in particular: Durkheimian positivism and structural functionalism; Marxist historical materialism and conflict theory; and Weberian antipositivism and verstehen analysis.
"American sociology broadly arose on a separate trajectory, with little Marxist influence, an emphasis on rigorous experimental methodology, and a closer association with pragmatism and social psychology."
"In the 1920s, the Chicago school developed symbolic interactionism."
"Meanwhile, in the 1930s, the Frankfurt School pioneered the idea of critical theory, an interdisciplinary form of Marxist sociology drawing upon thinkers as diverse as Sigmund Freud and Friedrich Nietzsche."
"Critical theory would take on something of a life of its own after World War II, influencing literary criticism and the Birmingham School establishment of cultural studies."
"Sociology evolved as an academic response to the challenges of modernity, such as industrialization, urbanization, secularization, and a perceived process of enveloping rationalization."
"The field generally concerns the social rules and processes that bind and separate people not only as individuals, but as members of associations, groups, communities and institutions, and includes the examination of the organization and development of human social life."
The sociological field of interest ranges from the analysis of short contacts between anonymous individuals on the street to the study of global social processes.
Most sociologists work in one or more subfields.
One useful way to describe the discipline is as a cluster of sub-fields that examine different dimensions of society.
"For example, social stratification studies inequality and class structure; demography studies changes in a population size or type; criminology examines criminal behaviour and deviance; and political sociology studies the interaction between society and state."
"Since its inception, sociological epistemologies, methods, and frames of enquiry, have significantly expanded and diverged."
"Sociologists use a diversity of research methods, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, draw upon empirical techniques, and engage critical theory."
"Common modern methods include case studies, historical research, interviewing, participant observation, social network analysis, survey research, statistical analysis, and model building, among other approaches."
"Since the late 1970s, many sociologists have tried to make the discipline useful for purposes beyond the academy."
"The results of sociological research aid educators, lawmakers, administrators, developers, and others interested in resolving social problems and formulating public policy, through subdisciplinary areas such as evaluation research, methodological assessment, and public sociology."
"In the early 1970s, women sociologists began to question sociological paradigms and the invisibility of women in sociological studies, analysis, and courses."
"In 1969, feminist sociologists challenged the discipline's androcentrism at the American Sociological Association's annual conference."
"This led to the founding of the organization Sociologists for Women in Society, and, eventually, a new sociology journal, Gender & Society."
"Today, the sociology of gender is considered to be one of the most prominent sub-fields in the discipline."
"New sociological sub-fields continue to appear — such as community studies, computational sociology, environmental sociology, network analysis, actor-network theory, gender studies, and a growing list, many of which are cross-disciplinary in nature."
"Area studies are interdisciplinary fields of research and scholarship pertaining to particular geographical, national/federal, or cultural regions."
Behavioural science is a term that encompasses all the disciplines that explore the activities of and interactions among organisms in the natural world.
Computational social science is an umbrella field encompassing computational approaches within the social sciences.
Demography is the statistical study of all human populations.
Development studies a multidisciplinary branch of social science that addresses issues of concern to developing countries.
"Environmental social science is the broad, transdisciplinary study of interrelations between humans and the natural environment."
"Environmental studies integrate social, humanistic, and natural science perspectives on the relation between humans and the natural environment."
"Gender studies integrates several social and natural sciences to study gender identity, masculinity, femininity, transgender issues, and sexuality."
"Information science is an interdisciplinary science primarily concerned with the collection, classification, manipulation, storage, retrieval and dissemination of information."
International studies covers both International relations (the study of foreign affairs and global issues among states within the international system) and International education (the comprehensive approach that intentionally prepares people to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world).
Legal management is a social sciences discipline that is designed for students interested in the study of state and legal elements.
"Library science is an interdisciplinary field that applies the practices, perspectives, and tools of management, information technology, education, and other areas to libraries; the collection, organization, preservation and dissemination of information resources; and the political economy of information."
Management consists of various levels of leadership and administration of an organization in all business and human organizations.
"It is the effective execution of getting people together to accomplish desired goals and objectives through adequate planning, executing and controlling activities."
"Marketing the identification of human needs and wants, defines and measures their magnitude for demand and understanding the process of consumer buying behaviour to formulate products and services, pricing, promotion and distribution to satisfy these needs and wants through exchange processes and building long-term relationships."
"Political economy is the study of production, buying and selling, and their relations with law, custom, and government."
"Public administration is one of the main branches of political science, and can be broadly described as the development, implementation and study of branches of government policy."
The pursuit of the public good by enhancing civil society and social justice is the ultimate goal of the field.
"Though public administration has been historically referred to as government management, it increasingly encompasses non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that also operate with a similar, primary dedication to the betterment of humanity."
Religious studies and Western esoteric studies incorporate and inform social-scientific research on phenomena broadly deemed religious.
"Religious studies, Western esoteric studies, and the social sciences developed in dialogue with one another."
"Social research began most intentionally, however, with the positivist philosophy of science in the 19th century."
"In contemporary usage, ""social research"" is a relatively autonomous term, encompassing the work of practitioners from various disciplines that share in its aims and methods."
"Social scientists employ a range of methods in order to analyse a vast breadth of social phenomena; from census survey data derived from millions of individuals, to the in-depth analysis of a single agent's social experiences; from monitoring what is happening on contemporary streets, to the investigation of ancient historical documents."
"The methods originally rooted in classical sociology and statistical mathematics have formed the basis for research in other disciplines, such as political science, media studies, and marketing and market research."
"Questionnaires, field-based data collection, archival database information and laboratory-based data collections are some of the measurement techniques used."
"It is noted the importance of measurement and analysis, focusing on the (difficult to achieve) goal of objective research or statistical hypothesis testing."
A mathematical model uses mathematical language to describe a system.
The process of developing a mathematical model is termed 'mathematical modelling' (also modeling).
Eykhoff (1974) defined a mathematical model as 'a representation of the essential aspects of an existing system (or a system to be constructed) that presents knowledge of that system in usable form'.
"Mathematical models can take many forms, including but not limited to dynamical systems, statistical models, differential equations, or game theoretic models."
"These and other types of models can overlap, with a given model involving a variety of abstract structures."
"The system is a set of interacting or interdependent entities, real or abstract, forming an integrated whole."
"The concept of an integrated whole can also be stated in terms of a system embodying a set of relationships that are differentiated from relationships of the set to other elements, and from relationships between an element of the set and elements not a part of the relational regime."
"A dynamical system modeled as a mathematical formalization has a fixed ""rule"" that describes the time dependence of a point's position in its ambient space."
Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers.
The evolution rule of the dynamical system is a fixed rule that describes what future states follow from the current state.
The rule is deterministic: for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state.
"Social scientists often conduct program evaluation, which is a systematic method for collecting, analyzing, and using information to answer questions about projects, policies and programs, particularly about their effectiveness and efficiency."
"In both the public and private sectors, stakeholders often want to know whether the programs they are funding, implementing, voting for, receiving or objecting to are producing the intended effect."
"While program evaluation first focuses around this definition, important considerations often include how much the program costs per participant, how the program could be improved, whether the program is worthwhile, whether there are better alternatives, if there are unintended outcomes, and whether the program goals are appropriate and useful."
"Dialectical materialism is the philosophy of Karl Marx, which he formulated by taking the dialectic of Hegel and joining it to the materialism of Feuerbach."
"Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, or philosophical discourse; it aims to understand the nature of gender inequality."
"Marxist theories, such as revolutionary theory and class theory, cover work in philosophy that is strongly influenced by Karl Marx's materialist approach to theory or is written by Marxists."
"Phronetic social science is a theory and methodology for doing social science focusing on ethics and political power, based on a contemporary interpretation of Aristotelian phronesis."
Post-colonial theory is a reaction to the cultural legacy of colonialism.
"Postmodernism refers to a point of departure for works of literature, drama, architecture, cinema, and design, as well as in marketing and business and in the interpretation of history, law, culture and religion in the late 20th century."
Rational choice theory is a framework for understanding and often formally modeling social and economic behaviour.
Social constructionism considers how social phenomena develop in social contexts.
"Structuralism is an approach to the human sciences that attempts to analyze a specific field (for instance, mythology) as a complex system of interrelated parts."
Antiscience is a position critical of science and the scientific method.
"In addition, some institutions have degrees for a particular social science, such as the Bachelor of Economics degree, though such specialized degrees are relatively rare in the United States."
Vastly more funding is spent on natural science studies of climate change and considerable sums are also spent on studies of impact of and adaptation to climate change.
"It has been argued that this is a misallocation of resources, as the most urgent puzzle at the current juncture is to work out how to change human behavior to mitigate climate change, whereas the natural science of climate change is already well established and there will be decades and centuries to handle adaptation."
"The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), was a federal socialist state in Northern Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991."
"Nominally a union of multiple national Soviet republics, it was a one-party state prior to 1990 governed by the Communist Party, with Moscow as its capital in its largest republic, the Russian SFSR."
"Other major urban centers were Leningrad (Russian SFSR), Kiev (Ukrainian SSR), Minsk (Byelorussian SSR), Tashkent (Uzbek SSR), Alma-Ata (Kazakh SSR) and Novosibirsk (Russian SFSR)."
"It was the largest country in the world by surface area, spanning over 10,000 kilometers (6,200 mi) east to west across 11 time zones and over 7,200 kilometers (4,500 mi) north to south."
"Its territory included much of Eastern Europe, parts of Northern Europe and Western Asia, and all of Central and North Asia."
"Its five biomes were tundra, taiga, steppes, desert, and mountains."
Its diverse population was officially known as the Soviet people.
"The Soviet Union had its roots in the October Revolution of 1917 when the Bolsheviks, headed by Vladimir Lenin, overthrew the Provisional Government that had earlier replaced the monarchy of the Russian Empire."
"They established the Russian Soviet Republic, beginning a civil war between the Bolshevik Red Army and many anti-Bolshevik forces across the former Empire, among whom the largest faction was the White Guard, which engaged in violent anti-communist repression against the Bolsheviks and their worker and peasant supporters known as the White Terror."
"The Red Army expanded and helped local Bolsheviks take power, establishing soviets, repressing their political opponents and rebellious peasants through Red Terror."
"The New Economic Policy (NEP), which was introduced by Lenin, led to a partial return of a free market and private property; this resulted in a period of economic recovery."
"Following Lenin's death in 1924, Joseph Stalin came to power."
Stalin suppressed all political opposition to his rule inside the Communist Party and inaugurated a command economy.
"As a result, the country underwent a period of rapid industrialization and forced collectivization, which led to significant economic growth, but also led to a man-made famine in 1932–1933 and expanded the Gulag labour camp system originally established in 1918."
"Stalin also fomented political paranoia and conducted the Great Purge to remove his actual and perceived opponents from the Party through mass arrests of military leaders, Communist Party members, and ordinary citizens alike, who were then sent to correctional labor camps or sentenced to death."
"On 23 August 1939, after unsuccessful efforts to form an anti-fascist alliance with Western powers, the Soviets signed the non-aggression agreement with Nazi Germany."
"After the start of World War II, the formally neutral Soviets invaded and annexed territories of several Eastern European states, including eastern Poland and the Baltic states."
"In June 1941 the Germans invaded, opening the largest and bloodiest theater of war in history."
Soviet war casualties accounted for the highest proportion of the conflict in the cost of acquiring the upper hand over Axis forces at intense battles such as Stalingrad.
Soviet forces eventually captured Berlin and won World War II in Europe on 9 May 1945.
The territory overtaken by the Red Army became satellite states of the Eastern Bloc.
"The Cold War emerged in 1947 as a result of a post-war Soviet dominance in Eastern Europe, where the Eastern Bloc confronted the Western Bloc that united in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1949."
"Following Stalin's death in 1953, a period known as de-Stalinization and the Khrushchev Thaw occurred under the leadership of Nikita Khrushchev."
"The country developed rapidly, as millions of peasants were moved into industrialized cities."
The USSR took an early lead in the Space Race with the first ever satellite and the first human spaceflight.
"In the 1970s, there was a brief détente of relations with the United States, but tensions resumed when the Soviet Union deployed troops in Afghanistan in 1979."
The war drained economic resources and was matched by an escalation of American military aid to Mujahideen fighters.
"In the mid-1980s, the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev, sought to further reform and liberalize the economy through his policies of glasnost and perestroika."
The goal was to preserve the Communist Party while reversing economic stagnation.
"The Cold War ended during his tenure and in 1989, Warsaw Pact countries in Eastern Europe overthrew their respective Marxist-Leninist regimes."
"In particular, the indecisive action of the Eastern European rulers after the Pan-European Picnic caused the fall of the Iron Curtain, which shattered the formerly powerful communist unity."
This led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements inside the USSR as well.
"Central authorities initiated a referendum—boycotted by the Baltic republics, Armenia, Georgia, and Moldova—which resulted in the majority of participating citizens voting in favor of preserving the Union as a renewed federation."
"It failed, with Russian President Boris Yeltsin playing a high-profile role in facing down the coup, resulting in the banning of the Communist Party."
The Russian Federation (formerly the Russian SFSR) assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations and is recognized as its continued legal personality.
The country had the world's second-largest economy and the largest standing military in the world.
The USSR was recognized as one of the five nuclear weapons states.
"It was a founding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council as well as a member of the OSCE, the WFTU and the leading member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and the Warsaw Pact."
It is written in Cyrillic letters.
The Soviets used the Cyrillic abbreviation so frequently that audiences worldwide became familiar with its meaning.
"Notably, both Cyrillic letters used have homoglyphic (but transliterally distinct) letters in Latin alphabets."
"Because of widespread familiarity with the Cyrillic abbreviation, Latin alphabet users in particular almost always use the Latin homoglyphs C and P (as opposed to the transliteral Latin letters S and R) when rendering the USSR's native abbreviation."
"In the English language media, the state was referred to as the Soviet Union or the USSR."
"In other European languages, the locally translated short forms and abbreviations are usually used such as Union soviétique and URSS in French, or Sowjetunion and UdSSR in German."
"In the English-speaking world, the Soviet Union was also informally called Russia and its citizens Russians, although that was technically incorrect since Russia was only one of the republics."
Such misapplications of the linguistic equivalents to the term Russia and its derivatives were frequent in other languages as well.
"Covering a sixth of Earth's land surface, its size was comparable to that of North America."
"Two other successor states, Kazakhstan and Ukraine, rank among the top 10 countries by land area, and the largest country entirely in Europe, respectively."
The European portion accounted for a quarter of the country's area and was the cultural and economic center.
"The eastern part in Asia extended to the Pacific Ocean to the east and Afghanistan to the south, and, except some areas in Central Asia, was much less populous."
"It had five climate zones: tundra, taiga, steppes, desert and mountains."
"The country bordered Afghanistan, China, Czechoslovakia, Finland, Hungary, Iran, Mongolia, North Korea, Norway, Poland, Romania, and Turkey from 1945 to 1991."
"The Bering Strait separated the USSR from the United States, while the La Pérouse Strait separated it from Japan."
"The USSR also included most of the world's largest lakes; the Caspian Sea (shared with Iran), and Lake Baikal, the world's largest (by volume) and deepest freshwater lake that is also an internal body of water in Russia."
"Although serfdom was abolished in 1861, it was done on terms unfavorable to the peasants and served to encourage revolutionaries."
"A parliament—the State Duma—was established in 1906 after the Russian Revolution of 1905, but Tsar Nicholas II resisted attempts to move from absolute to a constitutional monarchy."
Social unrest continued and was aggravated during World War I by military defeat and food shortages in major cities.
"A spontaneous popular uprising in Petrograd, in response to the wartime decay of Russia's economy and morale, culminated in the February Revolution and the toppling of Nicholas II and the imperial government in March 1917."
"The tsarist autocracy was replaced by the Russian Provisional Government, which intended to conduct elections to the Russian Constituent Assembly and to continue fighting on the side of the Entente in World War I."
"At the same time, workers' councils, known in Russian as ""Soviets"", sprang up across the country."
"The Bolsheviks, led by Vladimir Lenin, pushed for socialist revolution in the Soviets and on the streets."
"On 7 November 1917, the Red Guards stormed the Winter Palace in Petrograd, ending the rule of the Provisional Government and leaving all political power to the Soviets."
This event would later be officially known in Soviet bibliographies as the Great October Socialist Revolution.
"In December, the Bolsheviks signed an armistice with the Central Powers, though by February 1918, fighting had resumed."
"In March, the Soviets ended involvement in the war and signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk."
"A long and bloody Civil War ensued between the Reds and the Whites, starting in 1917 and ending in 1923 with the Reds' victory."
"It included foreign intervention, the execution of the former tsar and his family, and the famine of 1921, which killed about five million people."
"In March 1921, during a related conflict with Poland, the Peace of Riga was signed, splitting disputed territories in Belarus and Ukraine between the Republic of Poland and Soviet Russia."
"Soviet Russia had to resolve similar conflicts with the newly established republics of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania."
"On 28 December 1922, a conference of plenipotentiary delegations from the Russian SFSR, the Transcaucasian SFSR, the Ukrainian SSR and the Byelorussian SSR approved the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and the Declaration of the Creation of the USSR, forming the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics."
"These two documents were confirmed by the first Congress of Soviets of the USSR and signed by the heads of the delegations, Mikhail Kalinin, Mikhail Tskhakaya, Mikhail Frunze, Grigory Petrovsky, and Alexander Chervyakov, on 30 December 1922."
The formal proclamation was made from the stage of the Bolshoi Theatre.
"An intensive restructuring of the economy, industry and politics of the country began in the early days of Soviet power in 1917."
"A large part of this was done according to the Bolshevik Initial Decrees, government documents signed by Vladimir Lenin."
"One of the most prominent breakthroughs was the GOELRO plan, which envisioned a major restructuring of the Soviet economy based on total electrification of the country."
The plan became the prototype for subsequent Five-Year Plans and was fulfilled by 1931.
"After the economic policy of ""War communism"" during the Russian Civil War, as a prelude to fully developing socialism in the country, the Soviet government permitted some private enterprise to coexist alongside nationalized industry in the 1920s, and total food requisition in the countryside was replaced by a food tax."
"From its creation, the government in the Soviet Union was based on the one-party rule of the Communist Party (Bolsheviks)."
"The stated purpose was to prevent the return of capitalist exploitation, and that the principles of democratic centralism would be the most effective in representing the people's will in a practical manner."
The debate over the future of the economy provided the background for a power struggle in the years after Lenin's death in 1924.
"Initially, Lenin was to be replaced by a ""troika"" consisting of Grigory Zinoviev of the Ukrainian SSR, Lev Kamenev of the Russian SFSR, and Joseph Stalin of the Transcaucasian SFSR."
"The same year, a Soviet Constitution was approved, legitimizing the December 1922 union."
"Despite the foundation of the Soviet state as a federative entity of many constituent republics, each with its own political and administrative entities, the term ""Soviet Russia"" – strictly applicable only to the Russian Federative Socialist Republic – was often applied to the entire country by non-Soviet writers and politicians."
"Lenin had appointed Stalin the head of the Workers' and Peasants' Inspectorate, which gave Stalin considerable power."
"By gradually consolidating his influence and isolating and outmanoeuvring his rivals within the party, Stalin became the undisputed leader of the country and, by the end of the 1920s, established a totalitarian rule."
"In October 1927, Zinoviev and Leon Trotsky were expelled from the Central Committee and forced into exile."
"In 1928, Stalin introduced the first five-year plan for building a socialist economy."
"In place of the internationalism expressed by Lenin throughout the Revolution, it aimed to build Socialism in One Country."
"In industry, the state assumed control over all existing enterprises and undertook an intensive program of industrialization."
"In agriculture, rather than adhering to the ""lead by example"" policy advocated by Lenin, forced collectivization of farms was implemented all over the country."
"Famines ensued as a result, causing deaths estimated at three to seven million; surviving kulaks were persecuted, and many were sent to Gulags to do forced labor."
"After the Spanish Civil War broke out in 1936, the USSR actively supported the Republican forces against the Nationalists, who were supported by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany."
"In December 1936, Stalin unveiled a new constitution that was praised by supporters around the world as the most democratic constitution imaginable, though there was some skepticism."
"Stalin's Great Purge resulted in the detainment or execution of many ""Old Bolsheviks"" who had participated in the October Revolution with Lenin."
"According to declassified Soviet archives, the NKVD arrested more than one and a half million people in 1937 and 1938, of whom 681,692 were shot."
"Almost a year after Britain and France had concluded the Munich Agreement with Germany, the Soviet Union made agreements with Germany as well, both militarily and economically during extensive talks."
The two countries concluded the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact and the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement in August 1939.
"The former made possible the Soviet occupation of Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and eastern Poland, while the Soviets remained formally neutral."
"In late November, unable to coerce the Republic of Finland by diplomatic means into moving its border 25 kilometres (16 mi) back from Leningrad, Stalin ordered the invasion of Finland."
"In the east, the Soviet military won several decisive victories during border clashes with the Empire of Japan in 1938 and 1939."
"However, in April 1941, the USSR signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact with Japan, recognizing the territorial integrity of Manchukuo, a Japanese puppet state."
The Red Army stopped the seemingly invincible German Army at the Battle of Moscow.
"The Battle of Stalingrad, which lasted from late 1942 to early 1943, dealt a severe blow to Germany from which they never fully recovered and became a turning point in the war."
"After Stalingrad, Soviet forces drove through Eastern Europe to Berlin before Germany surrendered in 1945."
The German Army suffered 80% of its military deaths in the Eastern Front.
"In the same year, the USSR, in fulfilment of its agreement with the Allies at the Yalta Conference, denounced the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1945 and invaded Manchukuo and other Japan-controlled territories on 9 August 1945."
"This conflict ended with a decisive Soviet victory, contributing to the unconditional surrender of Japan and the end of World War II."
"During the war, the country together with the United States, the United Kingdom and China were considered the Big Four Allied powers, and later became the Four Policemen that formed the basis of the United Nations Security Council."
It emerged as a superpower in the post-war period.
"Once denied diplomatic recognition by the Western world, the USSR had official relations with practically every country by the late 1940s."
"A member of the United Nations at its foundation in 1945, the country became one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, which gave it the right to veto any of its resolutions."
"It took effective control over most of the countries of Eastern Europe (except Yugoslavia and later Albania), turning them into satellite states."
"The USSR bound its satellite states in a military alliance, the Warsaw Pact, in 1955, and an economic organization, Council for Mutual Economic Assistance or Comecon, a counterpart to the European Economic Community (EEC), from 1949 to 1991."
"The USSR concentrated on its own recovery, seizing and transferring most of Germany's industrial plants, and it exacted war reparations from East Germany, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria using Soviet-dominated joint enterprises."
It also instituted trading arrangements deliberately designed to favor the country.
"Moscow controlled the Communist parties that ruled the satellite states, and they followed orders from the Kremlin."
"Later, the Comecon supplied aid to the eventually victorious Communist Party of China, and its influence grew elsewhere in the world."
"Fearing its ambitions, the Soviet Union's wartime allies, the United Kingdom and the United States, became its enemies."
"In the ensuing Cold War, the two sides clashed indirectly in proxy wars."
"Without a mutually agreeable successor, the highest Communist Party officials initially opted to rule the Soviet Union jointly through a troika headed by Georgy Malenkov."
"This did not last, however, and Nikita Khrushchev eventually won the ensuing power struggle by the mid-1950s."
"In 1956, he denounced Joseph Stalin and proceeded to ease controls over the party and society."
"Moscow considered Eastern Europe to be a critically vital buffer zone for the forward defence of its western borders, in case of another major invasion such as the German invasion of 1941."
"For this reason, the USSR sought to cement its control of the region by transforming the Eastern European countries into satellite states, dependent upon and subservient to its leadership."
"As a result, Soviet military forces were used to suppress an anti-communist uprising in Hungary in 1956."
"In the late 1950s, a confrontation with China regarding the Soviet rapprochement with the West, and what Mao Zedong perceived as Khrushchev's revisionism, led to the Sino–Soviet split."
"This resulted in a break throughout the global Marxist–Leninist movement, with the governments in Albania, Cambodia and Somalia choosing to ally with China."
"This included some openness and contact with other nations and new social and economic policies with more emphasis on commodity goods, allowing a dramatic rise in living standards while maintaining high levels of economic growth."
Censorship was relaxed as well.
"Khrushchev's reforms in agriculture and administration, however, were generally unproductive."
"In 1962, he precipitated a crisis with the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba."
"An agreement was made with the United States to remove nuclear missiles from both Cuba and Turkey, concluding the crisis."
"This event caused Khrushchev much embarrassment and loss of prestige, resulting in his removal from power in 1964."
"In 1968, the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact allies invaded Czechoslovakia to halt the Prague Spring reforms."
"In the aftermath, Brezhnev justified the invasion and previous military interventions as well as any potential military interventions in the future by introducing the Brezhnev Doctrine, which proclaimed any threat to socialist rule in a Warsaw Pact state as a threat to all Warsaw Pact states, therefore justifying military intervention."
"Brezhnev presided throughout détente with the West that resulted in treaties on armament control (SALT I, SALT II, Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty) while at the same time building up Soviet military might."
"In October 1977, the third Soviet Constitution was unanimously adopted."
The prevailing mood of the Soviet leadership at the time of Brezhnev's death in 1982 was one of aversion to change.
"The long period of Brezhnev's rule had come to be dubbed one of ""standstill"", with an ageing and ossified top political leadership."
"This period is also known as the Era of Stagnation, a period of adverse economic, political, and social effects in the country, which began during the rule of Brezhnev and continued under his successors Yuri Andropov and Konstantin Chernenko."
"In late 1979, the Soviet Union's military intervened in the ongoing civil war in neighboring Afghanistan, effectively ending a détente with the West."
"Brezhnev's next two successors, transitional figures with deep roots in his tradition, did not last long."
Yuri Andropov was 68 years old and Konstantin Chernenko 72 when they assumed power; both died in less than two years.
"In an attempt to avoid a third short-lived leader, in 1985, the Soviets turned to the next generation and selected Mikhail Gorbachev."
"He made significant changes in the economy and party leadership, called perestroika."
His policy of glasnost freed public access to information after decades of heavy government censorship.
Gorbachev also moved to end the Cold War.
"In the following year, Gorbachev refused to interfere in the internal affairs of the Soviet satellite states, which paved the way for the Revolutions of 1989."
"In particular, the standstill of the Soviet Union at the Pan-European Picnic in August 1989 then set a peaceful chain reaction in motion at the end of which the Eastern Bloc collapsed."
"On 7 April 1990, a law was passed allowing a republic to secede if more than two-thirds of its residents voted for it in a referendum."
Many held their first free elections in the Soviet era for their own national legislatures in 1990.
"Many of these legislatures proceeded to produce legislation contradicting the Union laws in what was known as the ""War of Laws""."
Boris Yeltsin was elected its chairman.
"On 12 June 1990, the Congress declared Russia's sovereignty over its territory and proceeded to pass laws that attempted to supersede some of the Soviet laws."
"A referendum for the preservation of the USSR was held on 17 March 1991 in nine republics (the remainder having boycotted the vote), with the majority of the population in those republics voting for preservation of the Union."
The referendum gave Gorbachev a minor boost.
"In the summer of 1991, the New Union Treaty, which would have turned the country into a much looser Union, was agreed upon by eight republics."
"The signing of the treaty, however, was interrupted by the August Coup—an attempted coup d'état by hardline members of the government and the KGB who sought to reverse Gorbachev's reforms and reassert the central government's control over the republics."
"After the coup collapsed, Yeltsin was seen as a hero for his decisive actions, while Gorbachev's power was effectively ended."
The balance of power tipped significantly towards the republics.
"In August 1991, Latvia and Estonia immediately declared the restoration of their full independence (following Lithuania's 1990 example)."
"Gorbachev resigned as general secretary in late August, and soon afterwards, the party's activities were indefinitely suspended—effectively ending its rule."
"By the fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside Moscow, and he was being challenged even there by Yeltsin, who had been elected President of Russia in July 1991."
"However, by December all except Russia and Kazakhstan had formally declared independence."
"During this time, Yeltsin took over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Moscow Kremlin."
"The final blow was struck on 1 December when Ukraine, the second-most powerful republic, voted overwhelmingly for independence."
Ukraine's secession ended any realistic chance of the country staying together even on a limited scale.
"On 8 December 1991, the presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus (formerly Byelorussia), signed the Belavezha Accords, which declared the Soviet Union dissolved and established the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in its place."
"While doubts remained over the authority of the accords to do this, on 21 December 1991, the representatives of all Soviet republics except Georgia signed the Alma-Ata Protocol, which confirmed the accords."
"On 25 December 1991, Gorbachev resigned as the President of the USSR, declaring the office extinct."
He turned the powers that had been vested in the presidency over to Yeltsin.
"That night, the Soviet flag was lowered for the last time, and the Russian tricolor was raised in its place."
"The following day, the Supreme Soviet, the highest governmental body, voted both itself and the country out of existence."
"This is generally recognized as marking the official, final dissolution of the Soviet Union as a functioning state, and the end of the Cold War."
The Soviet Army initially remained under overall CIS command but was soon absorbed into the different military forces of the newly independent states.
The few remaining Soviet institutions that had not been taken over by Russia ceased to function by the end of 1991.
"Following the dissolution, Russia was internationally recognized as its legal successor on the international stage."
"To that end, Russia voluntarily accepted all Soviet foreign debt and claimed Soviet overseas properties as its own."
"Under the 1992 Lisbon Protocol, Russia also agreed to receive all nuclear weapons remaining in the territory of other former Soviet republics."
"Since then, the Russian Federation has assumed the Soviet Union's rights and obligations."
"Ukraine has refused to recognize exclusive Russian claims to succession of the USSR and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was codified in Articles 7 and 8 of its 1991 law On Legal Succession of Ukraine."
"Since its independence in 1991, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against Russia in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was owned by the USSR."
"The dissolution was followed by a severe drop in economic and social conditions in post-Soviet states, including a rapid increase in poverty, crime, corruption, unemployment, homelessness, rates of disease, infant mortality and domestic violence, as well as demographic losses and income inequality and the rise of an oligarchical class, along with decreases in calorie intake, life expectancy, adult literacy, and income."
"Between 1988/1989 and 1993/1995, the Gini ratio increased by an average of 9 points for all former socialist countries."
The economic shocks that accompanied wholesale privatization were associated with sharp increases in mortality.
"Data shows Russia, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia saw a tripling of unemployment and a 42% increase in male death rates between 1991 and 1994."
"Before the dissolution, the country had maintained its status as one of the world's two superpowers for four decades after World War II through its hegemony in Eastern Europe, military strength, economic strength, aid to developing countries, and scientific research, especially in space technology and weaponry."
The Russian Federation is seen as the legal continuator state and is for most purposes the heir to the Soviet Union.
"It retained ownership of all former Soviet embassy properties, as well as the old Soviet UN membership and permanent membership on the Security Council."
"Of the two other co-founding states of the USSR at the time of the dissolution, Ukraine was the only one that had passed laws, similar to Russia, that it is a state-successor of both the Ukrainian SSR and the USSR."
"Although it had a tough position at the time, due to Russia's position as a ""single continuation of the USSR"" that became widely accepted in the West as well as a constant pressure from the Western countries, allowed Russia to dispose state property of USSR abroad and conceal information about it."
"Due to that Ukraine never ratified ""zero option"" agreement that Russian Federation had signed with other former Soviet republics, as it denied disclosing of information about Soviet Gold Reserves and its Diamond Fund."
"We can continue to poke Kiev handouts in the calculation of ""solve the problem"", only it won't be solved."
"Going to a trial is also pointless: for a number of European countries this is a political issue, and they will make a decision clearly in whose favor."
What to do in this situation is an open question.
Search for non-trivial solutions.
"But we must remember that in 2014, with the filing of the then Ukrainian Prime Minister Yatsenyuk, litigation with Russia resumed in 32 countries."
Similar situation occurred with restitution of cultural property.
The Chechen separatist movement of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria lacks any international recognition.
"Otherwise, Soviet foreign policy was set by the commission on the Foreign Policy of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or by the party's highest body the Politburo."
Operations were handled by the separate Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
"It was known as the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs (or Narkomindel), until 1946."
Intellectuals were based in the Moscow State Institute of International Relations.
"The Comintern intended to ""struggle by all available means, including armed force, for the overthrow of the international bourgeoisie and the creation of an international Soviet republic as a transition stage to the complete abolition of the state""."
It was abolished as a conciliatory measure toward Britain and the United States.
"Moscow was concerned about the Marshall Plan, and Comecon was meant to prevent countries in the Soviets' sphere of influence from moving towards that of the Americans and Southeast Asia."
"The Warsaw Pact was the military complement to the Comecon, the regional economic organization for the socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe."
The Warsaw Pact was created in reaction to the integration of West Germany into NATO.
Its role was to coordinate actions between Marxist-Leninist parties under Soviet direction.
Stalin used it to order Western European communist parties to abandon their exclusively parliamentarian line and instead concentrate on politically impeding the operations of the Marshall Plan.
It expelled Yugoslavia in 1948 after Josip Broz Tito insisted on an independent program.
"Its newspaper, For a Lasting Peace, for a People's Democracy!, promoted Stalin's positions."
The Cominform's concentration on Europe meant a deemphasis on world revolution in Soviet foreign policy.
"By enunciating a uniform ideology, it allowed the constituent parties to focus on personalities rather than issues."
The Comintern was the weapon of choice.
"A few revolutions did break out, but they were quickly suppressed (the longest lasting one was in Hungary)—the Hungarian Soviet Republic—lasted only from 21 March 1919 to 1 August 1919."
The Russian Bolsheviks were in no position to give any help.
"By 1921, Lenin, Trotsky, and Stalin realized that capitalism had stabilized itself in Europe and there would not be any widespread revolutions anytime soon."
"It became the duty of the Russian Bolsheviks to protect what they had in Russia, and avoid military confrontations that might destroy their bridgehead."
"Russia was now a pariah state, along with Germany."
The two came to terms in 1922 with the Treaty of Rapallo that settled long-standing grievances.
"The United Kingdom dismissed the warnings of Winston Churchill and a few others about a continuing Marxist-Leninist threat, and opened trade relations and de facto diplomatic recognition in 1922."
"There was hope for a settlement of the pre-war Tsarist debts, but it was repeatedly postponed."
Formal recognition came when the new Labour Party came to power in 1924.
All the other countries followed suit in opening trade relations.
"Henry Ford opened large-scale business relations with the Soviets in the late 1920s, hoping that it would lead to long-term peace."
"Adolf Hitler proposed a better deal, which would give the USSR control over much of Eastern Europe through the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact."
"In September, Germany invaded Poland, and the USSR also invaded later that month, resulting in the partition of Poland."
"In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany, marking the beginning of World War II."
"In turn, the Central Committee voted for a Politburo (called the Presidium between 1952 and 1966), Secretariat and the General Secretary (First Secretary from 1953 to 1966), the de facto highest office in the Soviet Union."
"Depending on the degree of power consolidation, it was either the Politburo as a collective body or the General Secretary, who always was one of the Politburo members, that effectively led the party and the country (except for the period of the highly personalized authority of Stalin, exercised directly through his position in the Council of Ministers rather than the Politburo after 1941)."
All senior government officials and most deputies of the Supreme Soviet were members of the CPSU.
"Upon the forced retirement of Khrushchev, the party leader was prohibited from this kind of double membership, but the later General Secretaries for at least some part of their tenure occupied the mostly ceremonial position of Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, the nominal head of state."
"Nor was the party itself monolithic from top to bottom, although factions were officially banned."
"However, its powers and functions were extended in the late 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, including the creation of new state commissions and committees."
It gained additional powers relating to the approval of the Five-Year Plans and the government budget.
"The Supreme Soviet elected a Presidium (successor of the Central Executive Committee) to wield its power between plenary sessions, ordinarily held twice a year, and appointed the Supreme Court, the Procurator General and the Council of Ministers (known before 1946 as the Council of People's Commissars), headed by the Chairman (Premier) and managing an enormous bureaucracy responsible for the administration of the economy and society."
"State and party structures of the constituent republics largely emulated the structure of the central institutions, although the Russian SFSR, unlike the other constituent republics, for most of its history had no republican branch of the CPSU, being ruled directly by the union-wide party until 1990."
"Local authorities were organized likewise into party committees, local Soviets and executive committees."
"It was instrumental in the Great Purge, but was brought under strict party control after Stalin's death."
"Under Yuri Andropov, the KGB engaged in the suppression of political dissent and maintained an extensive network of informers, reasserting itself as a political actor to some extent independent of the party-state structure, culminating in the anti-corruption campaign targeting high-ranking party officials in the late 1970s and early 1980s."
"No formal separation of powers existed between the Party, Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers that represented executive and legislative branches of the government."
"The system was governed less by statute than by informal conventions, and no settled mechanism of leadership succession existed."
"Bitter and at times deadly power struggles took place in the Politburo after the deaths of Lenin and Stalin, as well as after Khrushchev's dismissal, itself due to a decision by both the Politburo and the Central Committee."
"The Congress of People's Deputies was established, the majority of whose members were directly elected in competitive elections held in March 1989."
"The Congress now elected the Supreme Soviet, which became a full-time parliament, and much stronger than before."
"For the first time since the 1920s, it refused to rubber stamp proposals from the party and Council of Ministers."
"The coup failed, and the State Council of the Soviet Union became the highest organ of state power ""in the period of transition""."
"Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary, only remaining President for the final months of the existence of the USSR."
The Supreme Court supervised the lower courts (People's Court) and applied the law as established by the constitution or as interpreted by the Supreme Soviet.
The Constitutional Oversight Committee reviewed the constitutionality of laws and acts.
"The Soviet Union used the inquisitorial system of Roman law, where the judge, procurator, and defence attorney collaborate to establish the truth."
"With the constitution of 1936, the Transcaucasian SFSR was dissolved, resulting in its constituent republics of Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan being elevated to Union Republics, while Kazakhstan and Kirghizia were split off from Russian SFSR, resulting in the same status."
"In August 1940, Moldavia was formed from parts of Ukraine and Bessarabia and northern Bukovina."
"Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania (SSRs) were also admitted into the union which was not recognized by most of the international community and was considered an illegal occupation."
Karelia was split off from Russia as a Union Republic in March 1940 and was reabsorbed in 1956.
"The domination was so absolute that for most of its existence, the country was commonly (but incorrectly) referred to as ""Russia""."
"While the RSFSR was technically only one republic within the larger union, it was by far the largest (both in terms of population and area), most powerful, most developed, and the industrial center of the Soviet Union."
"Historian Matthew White wrote that it was an open secret that the country's federal structure was ""window dressing"" for Russian dominance."
"For that reason, the people of the USSR were usually called ""Russians"", not ""Soviets"", since ""everyone knew who really ran the show""."
"The OGPU later became independent and in 1934 joined the NKVD, and so its internal troops were under the joint leadership of the defense and internal commissariats."
"After World War II, Strategic Missile Forces (1959), Air Defense Forces (1948) and National Civil Defense Forces (1970) were formed, which ranked first, third, and sixth in the official Soviet system of importance (ground forces were second, Air Force Fourth, and Navy Fifth)."
The army had the greatest political influence.
"In 1989, there served two million soldiers divided between 150 motorized and 52 armored divisions."
"Until the early 1960s, the Soviet navy was a rather small military branch, but after the Caribbean crisis, under the leadership of Sergei Gorshkov, it expanded significantly."
It became known for battlecruisers and submarines.
The Soviet Air Force focused on a fleet of strategic bombers and during war situation was to eradicate enemy infrastructure and nuclear capacity.
The air force also had a number of fighters and tactical bombers to support the army in the war.
"Strategic missile forces had more than 1,400 intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), deployed between 28 bases and 300 command centers."
"In the post-war period, the Soviet Army was directly involved in several military operations abroad."
"These included the suppression of the uprising in East Germany (1953), Hungarian revolution (1956) and the invasion of Czechoslovakia (1968)."
The Soviet Union also participated in the war in Afghanistan between 1979 and 1989.
"In the Soviet Union, general conscription applied."
This was followed by other successful satellites and experimental dogs were sent.
He once flew around the Earth and successfully landed in the Kazakh steppe.
"At that time, the first plans for space shuttles and orbital stations were drawn up in Soviet design offices, but in the end personal disputes between designers and management prevented this."
"The first big fiasco for the USSR was the landing on the moon by the Americans, when the Russians were not able to respond to the Americans in time with the same project."
"In the 1970s, more specific proposals for the design of the space shuttle began to emerge, but shortcomings, especially in the electronics industry (rapid overheating of electronics), postponed the program until the end of the 1980s."
"The first shuttle, the Buran, flew in 1988, but without a human crew."
"Another shuttle, Ptichka, eventually ended up under construction, as the shuttle project was canceled in 1991."
"For their launch into space, there is today an unused superpower rocket, Energia, which is the most powerful in the world."
"In the late 1980s, the Soviet Union managed to build the Mir orbital station."
It was built on the construction of Salyut stations and its tasks were purely civilian and research.
"In the 1990s, when the US Skylab was shut down due to lack of funds, it was the only orbital station in operation."
"Gradually, other modules were added to it, including American ones."
"However, the technical condition of the station deteriorated rapidly, especially after the fire, so in 2001 it was decided to bring it into the atmosphere where it burned down."
"The first Bolshevik experience with a command economy was the policy of War communism, which involved the nationalization of industry, centralized distribution of output, coercive requisition of agricultural production, and attempts to eliminate money circulation, private enterprises and free trade."
"After the severe economic collapse, Lenin replaced war communism by the New Economic Policy (NEP) in 1921, legalizing free trade and private ownership of small businesses."
"Resources were mobilized for rapid industrialization, which significantly expanded Soviet capacity in heavy industry and capital goods during the 1930s."
"The primary motivation for industrialization was preparation for war, mostly due to distrust of the outside capitalist world."
"As a result, the USSR was transformed from a largely agrarian economy into a great industrial power, leading the way for its emergence as a superpower after World War II."
"The war caused extensive devastation of the Soviet economy and infrastructure, which required massive reconstruction."
"By the early 1940s, the Soviet economy had become relatively self-sufficient; for most of the period until the creation of Comecon, only a tiny share of domestic products was traded internationally."
"After the creation of the Eastern Bloc, external trade rose rapidly."
"However, the influence of the world economy on the USSR was limited by fixed domestic prices and a state monopoly on foreign trade."
Grain and sophisticated consumer manufactures became major import articles from around the 1960s.
"During the arms race of the Cold War, the Soviet economy was burdened by military expenditures, heavily lobbied for by a powerful bureaucracy dependent on the arms industry."
"At the same time, the USSR became the largest arms exporter to the Third World."
Significant amounts of Soviet resources during the Cold War were allocated in aid to the other socialist states.
"From the 1930s until its dissolution in late 1991, the way the Soviet economy operated remained essentially unchanged."
"The economy was formally directed by central planning, carried out by Gosplan and organized in five-year plans."
"However, in practice, the plans were highly aggregated and provisional, subject to ad hoc intervention by superiors."
All critical economic decisions were taken by the political leadership.
Allocated resources and plan targets were usually denominated in rubles rather than in physical goods.
"Credit was discouraged, but widespread."
"The final allocation of output was achieved through relatively decentralized, unplanned contracting."
"In the manufacturing sector, heavy industry and defence were prioritized over consumer goods."
"Consumer goods, particularly outside large cities, were often scarce, of poor quality and limited variety."
"Under the command economy, consumers had almost no influence on production, and the changing demands of a population with growing incomes could not be satisfied by supplies at rigidly fixed prices."
"A massive unplanned second economy grew up at low levels alongside the planned one, providing some of the goods and services that the planners could not."
The legalization of some elements of the decentralized economy was attempted with the reform of 1965.
"Although statistics of the Soviet economy are notoriously unreliable and its economic growth difficult to estimate precisely, by most accounts, the economy continued to expand until the mid-1980s."
"During the 1950s and 1960s, it had comparatively high growth and was catching up to the West."
"However, after 1970, the growth, while still positive, steadily declined much more quickly and consistently than in other countries, despite a rapid increase in the capital stock (the rate of capital increase was only surpassed by Japan)."
"Overall, the growth rate of per capita income in the Soviet Union between 1960 and 1989 was slightly above the world average (based on 102 countries)."
"According to Stanley Fischer and William Easterly, growth could have been faster."
"By their calculation, per capita income in 1989 should have been twice higher than it was, considering the amount of investment, education and population."
The authors attribute this poor performance to the low productivity of capital.
Steven Rosenfielde states that the standard of living declined due to Stalin's despotism.
"His policies relaxed state control over enterprises but did not replace it by market incentives, resulting in a sharp decline in output."
"The economy, already suffering from reduced petroleum export revenues, started to collapse."
"Prices were still fixed, and the property was still largely state-owned until after the country's dissolution."
"For most of the period after World War II until its collapse, Soviet GDP (PPP) was the second-largest in the world, and third during the second half of the 1980s, although on a per-capita basis, it was behind that of First World countries."
"It was the third-highest in the Eastern Bloc, behind Czechoslovakia and East Germany, and the 25th in the world of 130 countries."
"At the start, this decline grew very rapidly but gradually slowed down between 1970 and 1975."
"David Wilson, a historian, believed that the gas industry would account for 40% of Soviet fuel production by the end of the century."
His theory did not come to fruition because of the USSR's collapse.
"Petroleum and petroleum-based products, natural gas, metals, wood, agricultural products, and a variety of manufactured goods, primarily machinery, arms and military equipment, were exported."
"In the 1970s and 1980s, the USSR heavily relied on fossil fuel exports to earn hard currency."
"At its peak in 1988, it was the largest producer and second-largest exporter of crude oil, surpassed only by Saudi Arabia."
Lenin believed that the USSR would never overtake the developed world if it remained as technologically backward as it was upon its founding.
"Soviet authorities proved their commitment to Lenin's belief by developing massive networks, research and development organizations."
"Due to rigid state planning and bureaucracy, the Soviets remained far behind technologically in chemistry, biology, and computers when compared to the First World."
"Under the Reagan administration, Project Socrates determined that the Soviet Union addressed the acquisition of science and technology in a manner that was radically different from what the US was using."
"In the case of the US, economic prioritization was being used for indigenous research and development as the means to acquire science and technology in both the private and public sectors."
"In contrast, the USSR was offensively and defensively maneuvering in the acquisition and utilization of the worldwide technology, to increase the competitive advantage that they acquired from the technology while preventing the US from acquiring a competitive advantage."
"However, technology-based planning was executed in a centralized, government-centric manner that greatly hindered its flexibility."
This was exploited by the US to undermine the strength of the Soviet Union and thus foster its reform.
"The economic centralization of the late 1920s and 1930s led to the development of infrastructure on a massive scale, most notably the establishment of Aeroflot, an aviation enterprise."
"The country had a wide variety of modes of transport by land, water and air."
"The street network and automotive industry remained underdeveloped, and dirt roads were common outside major cities."
Soviet maintenance projects proved unable to take care of even the few roads the country had.
"By the early-to-mid-1980s, the Soviet authorities tried to solve the road problem by ordering the construction of new ones."
"Meanwhile, the automobile industry was growing at a faster rate than road construction."
Soviet authorities were unable to meet the growing demand for transport infrastructure and services.
The Soviet merchant navy was one of the largest in the world.
The postwar Soviet population was 45 to 50 million smaller than it would have been if pre-war demographic growth had continued.
"In general, the birth rates of the southern republics in Transcaucasia and Central Asia were considerably higher than those in the northern parts of the Soviet Union, and in some cases even increased in the post–World War II period, a phenomenon partly attributed to slower rates of urbanistion and traditionally earlier marriages in the southern republics."
"An analysis of the official data from the late 1980s showed that after worsening in the late-1970s and the early 1980s, adult mortality began to improve again."
"Some researchers regarded the rise as mostly real, a consequence of worsening health conditions and services."
"The rises in both adult and infant mortality were not explained or defended by Soviet officials, and the Soviet government stopped publishing all mortality statistics for ten years."
"Soviet demographers and health specialists remained silent about the mortality increases until the late-1980s, when the publication of mortality data resumed, and researchers could delve into the real causes."
"Many early Russian feminists and ordinary Russian working women actively participated in the Revolution, and many more were affected by the events of that period and the new policies."
"Beginning in October 1918,  Lenin's government liberalized divorce and abortion laws, decriminalized homosexuality (re-criminalized in the 1930s), permitted cohabitation, and ushered in a host of reforms."
"However, without birth control, the new system produced many broken marriages, as well as countless out-of-wedlock children."
The epidemic of divorces and extramarital affairs created social hardships when Soviet leaders wanted people to concentrate their efforts on growing the economy.
"Giving women control over their fertility also led to a precipitous decline in the birth rate, perceived as a threat to their country's military power."
"After heavy casualties in World War I and II, women outnumbered men in Russia by a 4:3 ratio."
This contributed to the larger role women played in Russian society compared to other great powers at the time.
"In the beginning, the Soviet authorities placed great emphasis on the elimination of illiteracy."
All left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand in the Soviet school system.
Literate people were automatically hired as teachers.
"For a short period, quality was sacrificed for quantity."
"In the aftermath of World War II, the country's educational system expanded dramatically, which had a tremendous effect."
"Nikita Khrushchev tried to make education more accessible, making it clear to children that education was closely linked to the needs of society."
Education also became important in giving rise to the New Man.
Citizens directly entering the workforce had the constitutional right to a job and to free vocational training.
"The education system was highly centralized and universally accessible to all citizens, with affirmative action for applicants from nations associated with cultural backwardness."
"However, as part of the general antisemitic policy, an unofficial Jewish quota was applied in the leading institutions of higher education by subjecting Jewish applicants to harsher entrance examinations."
The Brezhnev era also introduced a rule that required all university applicants to present a reference from the local Komsomol party secretary.
"According to statistics from 1986, the number of higher education students per the population of 10,000 was 181 for the USSR, compared to 517 for the US."
The ethnicity of a person was chosen at the age of sixteen by the child's parents.
"If the parents did not agree, the child was automatically assigned the ethnicity of the father."
"Partly due to Soviet policies, some of the smaller minority ethnic groups were considered part of larger ones, such as the Mingrelians of Georgia, who were classified with the linguistically related Georgians."
"Some ethnic groups voluntarily assimilated, while others were brought in by force."
"Russians, Belarusians, and Ukrainians shared close cultural ties, while other groups did not."
"During the Soviet era, a significant number of ethnic Russians and Ukrainians migrated to other Soviet republics, and many of them settled there."
"According to the last census in 1989, the Russian ""diaspora"" in the Soviet republics had reached 25 million."
"As Lenin later noted, ""Either the lice will defeat socialism, or socialism will defeat the lice""."
The Soviet principle of health care was conceived by the People's Commissariat for Health in 1918.
"Health care was to be controlled by the state and would be provided to its citizens free of charge, a revolutionary concept at the time."
"Before Leonid Brezhnev became General Secretary, the Soviet healthcare system was held in high esteem by many foreign specialists."
"This changed, however, from Brezhnev's accession and Mikhail Gorbachev's tenure as leader, during which the health care system was heavily criticized for many basic faults, such as the quality of service and the unevenness in its provision."
This statistic in itself was seen by some that the socialist system was superior to the capitalist system.
These improvements continued into the 1960s when statistics indicated that the life expectancy briefly surpassed that of the United States.
"Life expectancy started to decline in the 1970s, possibly because of alcohol abuse."
"At the same time, infant mortality began to rise."
"After 1974, the government stopped publishing statistics on the matter."
This trend can be partly explained by the number of pregnancies rising drastically in the Asian part of the country where infant mortality was the highest while declining markedly in the more developed European part of the Soviet Union.
"The development of these writing systems was highly successful, even though some flaws were detected."
"During the later days of the USSR, countries with the same multilingual situation implemented similar policies."
A serious problem when creating these writing systems was that the languages differed dialectally greatly from each other.
"When a language had been given a writing system and appeared in a notable publication, it would attain ""official language"" status."
"There were many minority languages which never received their own writing system; therefore, their speakers were forced to have a second language."
"There are examples where the government retreated from this policy, most notably under Stalin where education was discontinued in languages that were not widespread."
"These languages were then assimilated into another language, mostly Russian."
"Eastern Christianity predominated among Christians, with Russia's traditional Russian Orthodox Church being the largest Christian denomination."
"About 90% of the Soviet Union's Muslims were Sunnis, with Shias being concentrated in the Azerbaijan SSR."
The Russian Orthodox Church enjoyed a privileged status as the church of the monarchy and took part in carrying out official state functions.
"Citizens may teach and may be taught religion privately."""
"Among further restrictions, those adopted in 1929 included express prohibitions on a range of church activities, including meetings for organized Bible study."
Both Christian and non-Christian establishments were shut down by the thousands in the 1920s and 1930s.
"The government targeted religions based on state interests, and while most organized religions were never outlawed, religious property was confiscated, believers were harassed, and religion was ridiculed while atheism was propagated in schools."
"In 1925, the government founded the League of Militant Atheists to intensify the propaganda campaign."
"Accordingly, although personal expressions of religious faith were not explicitly banned, a strong sense of social stigma was imposed on them by the formal structures and mass media, and it was generally considered unacceptable for members of certain professions (teachers, state bureaucrats, soldiers) to be openly religious."
"While persecution accelerated following Stalin's rise to power, a revival of Orthodoxy was fostered by the government during World War II and the Soviet authorities sought to control the Russian Orthodox Church rather than liquidate it."
"During the first five years of Soviet power, the Bolsheviks executed 28 Russian Orthodox bishops and over 1,200 Russian Orthodox priests."
Many others were imprisoned or exiled.
Believers were harassed and persecuted.
"Most seminaries were closed, and the publication of most religious material was prohibited."
"Convinced that religious anti-Sovietism had become a thing of the past, and with the looming threat of war, the Stalin regime began shifting to a more moderate religion policy in the late 1930s."
Soviet religious establishments overwhelmingly rallied to support the war effort during World War II.
"Amid other accommodations to religious faith after the German invasion, churches were reopened."
"Radio Moscow began broadcasting a religious hour, and a historic meeting between Stalin and Orthodox Church leader Patriarch Sergius of Moscow was held in 1943."
Stalin had the support of the majority of the religious people in the USSR even through the late 1980s.
"During this period, the number of churches fell from 20,000 to 10,000 from 1959 to 1965, and the number of synagogues dropped from 500 to 97."
Official relations between the Orthodox Church and the government again warmed to the point that the Brezhnev government twice honored Orthodox Patriarch Alexy I with the Order of the Red Banner of Labour.
"A poll conducted by Soviet authorities in 1982 recorded 20% of the Soviet population as ""active religious believers."""
"The socio-economic nature of communist states such as the USSR, especially under Stalin, has also been much debated, varyingly being labelled a form of bureaucratic collectivism, state capitalism, state socialism, or a totally unique mode of production."
"The USSR implemented a broad range of policies over a long period of time, with a large amount of conflicting policies being implemented by different leaders."
"Some have a positive view of it whilst others are critical towards the country, calling it a repressive oligarchy."
"The opinions on the USSR are complex and have changed over time, with different generations having different views on the matter as well as on Soviet policies corresponding to separate time periods during its history."
Leftists have largely varying views on the USSR.
"Whilst some leftists such as anarchists and other libertarian socialists, agree it did not give the workers control over the means of production and was a centralized oligarchy, others have more positive opinions as to the Bolshevik policies and Vladimir Lenin."
Many anti-Stalinist leftists such as anarchists are extremely critical of Soviet authoritarianism and repression.
"Much of the criticism it receives is centered around massacres in the Soviet Union, the centralized hierarchy present in the USSR and mass political repression as well as violence towards government critics and political dissidents such as other leftists."
Critics also point towards its failure to implement any substantial worker cooperatives or implementing worker liberation as well as corruption and the Soviet authoritarian nature.
"Many Russians and other former Soviet citizens have nostalgia for the USSR, pointing towards most infrastructure being built during Soviet times, increased job security, increased literacy rate, increased caloric intake and supposed ethnic pluralism enacted in the Soviet Union as well as political stability."
"The Russian Revolution is also seen in a positive light as well as the leadership of Lenin, Nikita Khrushchev and the later USSR, although many view Joseph Stalin's rule as positive for the country."
"In Armenia, 12% of respondents said the USSR collapse did good, while 66% said it did harm."
"In Kyrgyzstan, 16% of respondents said the collapse of the USSR did good, while 61% said it did harm."
"In a 2018 Rating Sociological Group poll, 47% of Ukrainian respondents had a positive opinion of Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev, who ruled the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982."
"The war became a topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts."
"As a result of the massive losses suffered by the military and civilians during the conflict, Victory Day celebrated on 9 May is still one of the most important and emotional dates in Russia."
"In large part due to the Holodomor, ethnic Ukrainians have a negative view of it."
Russian-speaking Ukrainians of Ukraine's southern and eastern regions have a more positive view of the USSR.
"In some countries with internal conflict, there is also nostalgia for the USSR, especially for refugees of the post-Soviet conflicts who have been forced to flee their homes and have been displaced."
This nostalgia is less an admiration for the country or its policies than it is a longing to return to their homes and not to live in poverty.
The many Russian enclaves in the former USSR republics such as Transnistria have in a general a positive remembrance of it.
"Anarchists are critical of the country, labeling the Soviet system as red fascism."
"Soviets actively destroyed anarchist organizations and anarchist communities, labeling anarchists as ""enemies of the people""."
"The Soviet invasion of the anarchist Free Territory and suppression of the anarchist Kronstadt rebellion and the Norilsk uprising, in which prisoners created a radical system of government based on cooperatives and direct democracy in the Gulag, led to animosity and hatred towards the USSR."
Anarchist organizations and unions were also banned during the Spanish Civil War under the Republican government by orders from the Soviet government.
"Due to this, anarchists generally hold a large animosity towards the USSR."
"During the first decade following the revolution, there was relative freedom and artists experimented with several different styles to find a distinctive Soviet style of art."
Lenin wanted art to be accessible to the Russian people.
"In art and literature, numerous schools, some traditional and others radically experimental, proliferated."
Communist writers Maxim Gorky and Vladimir Mayakovsky were active during this time.
"As a means of influencing a largely illiterate society, films received encouragement from the state, and much of director Sergei Eisenstein's best work dates from this period."
"During Stalin's rule, the Soviet culture was characterized by the rise and domination of the government-imposed style of socialist realism, with all other trends being severely repressed, with rare exceptions, such as Mikhail Bulgakov's works."
"During this time, a distinctive period of Soviet culture developed, characterized by conformist public life and an intense focus on personal life."
"Greater experimentation in art forms was again permissible, resulting in the production of more sophisticated and subtly critical work."
"The regime loosened its emphasis on socialist realism; thus, for instance, many protagonists of the novels of author Yury Trifonov concerned themselves with problems of daily life rather than with building socialism."
"Underground dissident literature, known as samizdat, developed during this late period."
"In architecture, the Khrushchev era mostly focused on functional design as opposed to the highly decorated style of Stalin's epoch."
"In music, in response to the increasing popularity of forms of popular music like jazz in the West, many jazz orchestras were permitted throughout the USSR, notably the Melodiya Ensemble, named after the principle record label in the USSR."
"In the second half of the 1980s, Gorbachev's policies of perestroika and glasnost significantly expanded freedom of expression throughout the country in the media and the press."
"The Soviet Olympic Committee formed on 21 April 1951, and the IOC recognized the new body in its 45th session."
"In the same year, when the Soviet representative Konstantin Andrianov became an IOC member, the USSR officially joined the Olympic Movement."
The 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki thus became first Olympic Games for Soviet athletes.
The Soviet Union national ice hockey team won nearly every world championship and Olympic tournament between 1954 and 1991 and never failed to medal in any International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) tournament in which they competed.
"The advent of the state-sponsored ""full-time amateur athlete"" of the Eastern Bloc countries further eroded the ideology of the pure amateur, as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage."
"The Soviet Union entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession – in reality, the state paid many of these competitors to train on a full-time basis."
"Twenty percent of the specimens he tested, including those from sixteen gold medalists, would have resulted in disciplinary proceedings had the tests been official."
The results of Donike's unofficial tests later convinced the IOC to add his new technique to their testing protocols.
"Dated before the decision to boycott the 1984 Games, the document detailed the existing steroids operations of the program, along with suggestions for further enhancements."
Portugalov later became one of the leading figures involved in the implementation of Russian doping before the 2016 Summer Olympics.
"Lenin's quote ""Communism is Soviet power and electrification of the country!"""
in many respects summarizes the focus on modernization and industrial development.
"During the first five-year plan in 1928, Stalin proceeded to industrialize the country at all costs."
Values such as environmental and nature protection have been completely ignored in the struggle to create a modern industrial society.
"After Stalin's death, they focused more on environmental issues, but the basic perception of the value of environmental protection remained the same."
The Soviet media has always focused on the vast expanse of land and the virtually indestructible natural resources.
This made it feel that contamination and uncontrolled exploitation of nature were not a problem.
The Soviet state also firmly believed that scientific and technological progress would solve all the problems.
"Official ideology said that under socialism environmental problems could easily be overcome, unlike capitalist countries, where they seemingly could not be solved."
The Soviet authorities had an almost unwavering belief that man could transcend nature.
"Unparalleled in the world, it resulted in a large number of radioactive isotopes being released into the atmosphere."
Radioactive doses have scattered relatively far.
"4,000 new cases of thyroid cancer were reported after the incident, but this led to a relatively low number of deaths (WHO data, 2005)."
"However, the long-term effects of the accident are unknown."
The Kola Peninsula was one of the places with clear problems.
"Around the industrial cities of Monchegorsk and Norilsk, where nickel, for example, is mined, all forests have been destroyed by contamination, while the northern and other parts of Russia have been affected by emissions."
"During the 1990s, people in the West were also interested in the radioactive hazards of nuclear facilities, decommissioned nuclear submarines, and the processing of nuclear waste or spent nuclear fuel."
"It was also known in the early 1990s that the USSR had transported radioactive material to the Barents Sea and Kara Sea, which was later confirmed by the Russian parliament."
"The crown's authority in The Indies was enlarged by the papal grant of powers of patronage, giving it power in the religious sphere."
"An important element in the formation of Spain's empire was the dynastic union between Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon, known as the Catholic Monarchs, which initiated political, religious and social cohesion but not political unification."
"Iberian kingdoms retained their political identities, with particular administration and juridical configurations."
"Although the power of the Spanish sovereign as monarch varied from one territory to another, the monarch acted as such in a unitary manner over all the ruler's territories through a system of councils: the unity did not mean uniformity."
"In 1580, when Philip II of Spain succeeded to the throne of Portugal (as Philip I), he established the Council of Portugal, which oversaw Portugal and its empire and ""preserv[ed] its own laws, institutions, and monetary system, and united only in sharing a common sovereign."""
"In the early 16th century, it conquered and incorporated the Aztec and Inca empires, retaining indigenous elites loyal to the Spanish crown and converts to Christianity as intermediaries between their communities and royal government."
"After a short period of delegation of authority by the crown in the Americas, the crown asserted control over those territories and established the Council of the Indies to oversee rule there."
"The crown then established viceroyalties in the two main areas of settlement, Mexico and Peru, both regions of dense indigenous populations and mineral wealth."
The Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation—the first circumnavigation of the Earth—laid the foundation for the Pacific oceanic empire of Spain and began the Spanish colonization of the Philippines.
The structure of governance of its overseas empire was significantly reformed in the late 18th century by the Bourbon monarchs.
"Although the crown attempted to keep its empire a closed economic system under Habsburg rule, Spain was unable to supply the Indies with sufficient consumer goods to meet demand, so that foreign merchants from Genoa, France, England, Germany, and the Netherlands dominated the trade, with silver from the mines of Peru and Mexico flowing to other parts of Europe."
The merchant guild of Seville (later Cadiz) served as middlemen in the trade.
"The crown's trade monopoly was broken early in the 17th century, with the crown colluding with the merchant guild for fiscal reasons in circumventing the supposedly closed system."
"Spain was largely able to defend its territories in the Americas, with the Dutch, the English, and the French only taking small Caribbean islands and outposts, using them to engage in contraband trade with the Spanish populace in the Indies."
"The Bourbon monarchy attempted to expand trade within the empire, by allowing commerce between all ports in the empire, and took other measures to revive economic activity to the benefit of Spain."
"In the process, they gained a revenue and lost an empire."
"Spain experienced its greatest territorial losses during the early 19th century, when its colonies in the Americas began fighting for independence."
"By the year 1900 Spain had also lost its colonies in the Caribbean and Pacific, and it was left with only its African possessions."
"In Spanish America among the legacies of its relationship with Iberia, Spanish is the dominant language, Catholicism the main religion, and political traditions of representative government can be traced to the Spanish Constitution of 1812."
"In conjunction with the Portuguese Empire, the Spanish Empire's establishment in the 15th century ushered in the modern global era and the rise of European dominance in global affairs."
The union of Castile and Aragon united the economic and military power of Iberia under one dynasty.
"Their dynastic alliance was important for a number of reasons, ruling jointly over a large aggregation of territories although not in a unitary fashion."
"They successfully pursued expansion in Iberia in the Christian conquest of the Muslim Kingdom of Granada, completed in 1492, for which Valencia-born Pope Alexander VI gave them the title of the Catholic Monarchs."
"The Kingdom of Portugal had an advantage over the Crown of Castile, having earlier retaken territory from the Muslims."
"Following Portugal's earlier completion of the reconquest and its establishment of settled boundaries, it began to seek overseas expansion, first to the port of Ceuta (1415) and then by colonizing the Atlantic islands of Madeira (1418) and the Azores (1427–1452); it also began voyages down the west coast of Africa in the fifteenth century."
Its rival Castile laid claim to the Canary Islands (1402) and retook territory from the Moors in 1462.
"The Christian rivals, Castile and Portugal, came to formal agreements over the division of new territories in the Treaty of Alcaçovas (1479), as well as securing the crown of Castile for Isabella, whose accession was challenged militarily by Portugal."
"Following the voyage of Christopher Columbus in 1492 and first major settlement in the New World in 1493, Portugal and Castile divided the world by the Treaty of Tordesillas (1494), which gave Portugal Africa and Asia and the Western Hemisphere to Spain."
"The voyage of Christopher Columbus, a Genoese mariner married to a Portuguese woman in Lisbon, obtained the support of Isabella of Castile, sailing west in 1492, seeking a route to the Indies."
"Columbus unexpectedly encountered the western hemisphere, populated by peoples he named ""Indians."""
"Subsequent voyages and full-scale settlements of Spaniards followed, with gold beginning to flow into Castile's coffers."
Managing the expanding empire became an administrative issue.
"The reign of Ferdinand and Isabella began the professionalization of the apparatus of government in Spain, which led to a demand for men of letters (letrados) who were university graduates (licenciados), of Salamanca, Valladolid, Complutense and Alcalá."
"These lawyer-bureaucrats staffed the various councils of state, eventually including the Council of the Indies and Casa de Contratación, the two highest bodies in metropolitan Spain for the government of the empire in the New World, as well as royal government in The Indies."
"To do so, the monarchy implemented a system of encomienda."
Encomienda was a method of land control and distribution based upon vassalic ties.
"Land would be granted to a noble family, who were then responsible for farming and defending it."
"This eventually led to a large land based aristocracy, a separate ruling class that the crown later tried to eliminate in its overseas colonies."
"By implementing this method of political organization, the crown was able to implement new forms of private property without completely replacing already existing systems, such as the communal use of resources."
"After the military and political conquest, there was an emphasis on religious conquest as well, leading to the creation of the Spanish Inquisition."
"Although the Inquisition was technically a part of the Catholic church, Ferdinand and Isabella formed a separate Spanish Inquisition, which led to mass expulsion of Muslims and Jews from the peninsula."
"This religious court system was later adopted and transported to the Americas, though they took a less effective role there due to limited jurisdiction and large territories."
"It had conquered Melilla in 1497, and further expansionism policy in North Africa was developed during the regency of Ferdinand the Catholic in Castile, stimulated by the Cardinal Cisneros."
"Several towns and outposts in the North African coast were conquered and occupied by Castile: Mazalquivir (1505), Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1508), Oran (1509), Algiers (1510), Bougie and Tripoli (1510)."
"On the Atlantic coast, Spain took possession of the outpost of Santa Cruz de la Mar Pequeña (1476) with support from the Canary Islands, and it was retained until 1525 with the consent of the treaty of Cintra (1509)."
"The Spanish princesses married the heirs of Portugal, England and the House of Habsburg."
"Following the same strategy, the Catholic Monarchs decided to support the Aragonese house of Naples against Charles VIII of France in the Italian Wars beginning in 1494."
Ferdinand's general Gonzalo Fernández de Córdoba took over Naples after defeating the French at the Battle of Cerignola and the Battle of Garigliano in 1503.
"In these battles, which established the supremacy of the Spanish Tercios in European battlefields, the forces of the kings of Spain acquired a reputation for invincibility that would last until the mid-17th century."
"After the death of Queen Isabella in 1504, and her exclusion of Ferdinand from a further role in Castile, Ferdinand married Germaine de Foix in 1505, cementing an alliance with France."
"Had that couple had a surviving heir, likely the Crown of Aragon would have been split from Castile, which was inherited by Charles, Ferdinand and Isabella's grandson."
Ferdinand joined the League of Cambrai against Venice in 1508.
"In 1511, he became part of the Holy League against France, seeing a chance at taking both Milan—to which he held a dynastic claim—and Navarre."
"In 1516, France agreed to a truce that left Milan in its control and recognized Spanish control of Upper Navarre, which had effectively been a Spanish protectorate following a series of treaties in 1488, 1491, 1493, and 1495."
"The conquest of the Canary Islands, inhabited by Guanche people, began in 1402 during the reign of Henry III of Castile, by Norman nobleman Jean de Béthencourt under a feudal agreement with the crown."
"The conquest was completed with the campaigns of the armies of the Crown of Castile between 1478 and 1496, when the islands of Gran Canaria (1478–1483), La Palma (1492–1493), and Tenerife (1494–1496) were subjugated."
"Chronicler Pulgar wrote that the fame of the treasures of Guinea ""spread around the ports of Andalusia in such way that everybody tried to go there""."
"Worthless trinkets, Moorish textiles, and above all, shells from the Canary and Cape Verde islands were exchanged for gold, slaves, ivory and Guinea pepper."
"The War of the Castilian Succession (1475–79) provided the Catholic Monarchs with the opportunity not only to attack the main source of the Portuguese power, but also to take possession of this lucrative commerce."
The Crown officially organized this trade with Guinea: every caravel had to secure a government license and to pay a tax on one-fifth of their profits (a receiver of the customs of Guinea was established in Seville in 1475—the ancestor of the future and famous Casa de Contratación).
"Castilian fleets fought in the Atlantic Ocean, temporarily occupying the Cape Verde islands (1476), conquering the city of Ceuta in the Tingitan Peninsula in 1476 (but retaken by the Portuguese), and even attacked the Azores islands, being defeated at Praia."
"As a result of this naval victory, at the Treaty of Alcáçovas in 1479 Castile, while retaining her rights in the Canaries, recognized the Portuguese monopoly of fishing and navigation along the whole west African coast and Portugal's rights over the Madeira, Azores and Cape Verde islands [plus the right to conquer the Kingdom of Fez ]."""
"The treaty delimited the spheres of influence of the two countries, establishing the principle of the Mare clausum."
"Thus, the limitations imposed by the Alcáçovas treaty were overcome and a new and more balanced division of the world would be reached in the Treaty of Tordesillas between both emerging maritime powers."
"The Catholic Monarchs then negotiated with Christopher Columbus, a Genoese sailor attempting to reach Cipangu (Japan) by sailing west."
Castile was already engaged in a race of exploration with Portugal to reach the Far East by sea when Columbus made his bold proposal to Isabella.
"In the Capitulations of Santa Fe, dated on 17 April 1492, Christopher Columbus obtained from the Catholic Monarchs his appointment as viceroy and governor in the lands already discovered and that he might discover thenceforth; thereby, it was the first document to establish an administrative organization in the Indies."
Columbus' discoveries inaugurated the Spanish colonization of the Americas.
"Spain's claim to these lands was solidified by the Inter caetera papal bull dated 4 May 1493, and Dudum siquidem on 26 September 1493, which vested the sovereignty of the territories discovered and to be discovered."
"Since the Portuguese wanted to keep the line of demarcation of Alcaçovas running east and west along a latitude south of Cape Bojador, a compromise was worked out and incorporated in the Treaty of Tordesillas, dated on 7 June 1494, in which the globe was split into two hemispheres dividing Spanish and Portuguese claims."
"These actions gave Spain exclusive rights to establish colonies in all of the New World from north to south (later with the exception of Brazil, which Portuguese commander Pedro Alvares Cabral encountered in 1500), as well as the easternmost parts of Asia."
The treaty of Tordesillas was confirmed by Pope Julius II in the bull Ea quae pro bono pacis on 24 January 1506.
Other European powers did not see the treaty between Castile and Portugal as binding on themselves.
"Francis I of France observed ""The sun shines for me as for others and I should very much like to see the clause in Adam's will that excludes me from a share of the world."""
"Since the defense of Catholicism and propagation of the faith was the papacy's primary responsibility, there were a number of papal bulls promulgated that affected the powers of the crowns of Spain and Portugal in the religious sphere."
"Converting the inhabitants of in the newly discovered lands was entrusted by the papacy to the rulers of Portugal and Spain, through a series of papal actions."
"The Patronato real, or power of royal patronage for ecclesiastical positions had precedents in Iberia during the reconquest."
"In 1493 Pope Alexander, from the Iberian Kingdom of Valencia, issued a series of bulls."
The papal bull of Inter caetera vested the government and jurisdiction of newly found lands in the kings of Castile and León and their successors.
The territories were incorporated by the Catholic Monarchs as jointly held assets.
"In the Treaty of Villafáfila of 1506, Ferdinand renounced not only the government of Castile in favor of his son-in-law Philip I of Castile but also the lordship of the Indies, withholding a half of the income of the kingdoms of the Indies."
"The political condition of the Indies were to transform from ""Lordship"" of the Catholic Monarchs to ""Kingdoms"" for the heirs of Castile."
"In general, Indians were exempt from the tithe."
"Although the crown received these revenues, they were to be used for the direct support of the ecclesiastical hierarchy and pious establishments, so that the crown itself did not benefit financially from this income."
"The experiment was deemed a failure, with the natives considered too new in the faith to be ordained."
"Pope Paul III did issue a bull, Sublimis Deus (1537), declaring that natives were capable of becoming Christians, but Mexican (1555) and Peruvian (1567–68) provincial councils banned natives from ordination."
"The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted on the assumption that Columbus's grandiose assessment of what he found was true, so Spain negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line."
The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges.
"With that lesson learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas."
"The pattern in the Caribbean that played out over the larger Spanish Indies was exploration of an unknown area and claim of sovereignty for the crown; conquest of indigenous peoples or assumption of control without direct violence; settlement by Spaniards who were awarded the labour of indigenous people via the encomienda; and the existing settlements becoming the launch point for further exploration, conquest, and settlement, followed by the establishment institutions with officials appointed by the crown."
"As a Genoese with the connections to Portugal, Columbus considered settlement to be on the pattern of trading forts and factories, with salaried employees to trade with locals and to identify exploitable resources."
"However, Spanish settlement in the New World was based on a pattern of a large, permanent settlements with the entire complex of institutions and material life to replicate Castilian life in a different venue."
Columbus's second voyage in 1493 had a large contingent of settlers and goods to accomplish that.
"On Hispaniola, the city of Santo Domingo was founded in 1496 by Christopher Columbus's brother Bartholomew Columbus and became a stone-built, permanent city."
"As the Caribbean became a draw for Spanish settlement and as Columbus and his extended Genoese family failed to be recognized as officials worthy of the titles they held, there was unrest among Spanish settlers."
"The crown began to curtail the expansive powers that they had granted Columbus, first by appointment of royal governors and then a high court or Audiencia in 1511."
"Columbus encountered the mainland in 1498, and the Catholic Monarchs learned of his discovery in May 1499."
"Taking advantage of a revolt against Columbus in Hispaniola, they appointed Francisco de Bobadilla as governor of the Indies with civil and criminal jurisdiction over the lands discovered by Columbus."
"Bobadilla, however, was soon replaced by Frey Nicolás de Ovando in September 1501."
"Henceforth, the Crown would authorize to individuals voyages to discover territories in the Indies only with previous royal license, and after 1503 the monopoly of the Crown was assured by the establishment of the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) at Seville."
"The successors of Columbus, however, litigated against the Crown until 1536 for the fulfillment of the Capitulations of Santa Fe in the pleitos colombinos."
"In metropolitan Spain, the direction of the Americas was taken over by the Bishop Fonseca between 1493 and 1516, and again between 1518 and 1524, after a brief period of rule by Jean le Sauvage."
"That same year, the crown established a permanent high court, or audiencia, in the most important city at the time, Santo Domingo, on the island of Hispaniola (now Haiti and the Dominican Republic)."
Now oversight of the Indies was based both in Castile and with officials of the new royal court in the colony.
Those from the less prosperous Hispaniola were eager to search for new success in a new settlement.
From there Juan Ponce de León conquered Puerto Rico (1508) and Diego Velázquez took Cuba.
"The crown separated the territories of the mainland, designated as Castilla de Oro, from the viceroy of Hispaniola, establishing Pedrarias Dávila as General Lieutenant in 1513 with functions similar to those of a viceroy, while Balboa remained but was subordinated as governor of Panama and Coiba on the Pacific Coast; after his death, they returned to Castilla de Oro."
"The territory of Castilla de Oro did not include Veragua (which was comprised approximately between the Chagres River and cape Gracias a Dios), as it was subject to a lawsuit between the Crown and Diego Columbus, or the region farther north, towards the Yucatán peninsula, explored by Yáñez Pinzón and Solís in 1508–1509, due to its remoteness."
"The conflicts of the viceroy Columbus with the royal officers and with the Audiencia, created in Santo Domingo in 1511, caused his return to the Peninsula in 1515."
"It did stimulate some trade and industry, but the trading opportunities encountered were limited."
"Therefore, Spain started to invest in America with the creation of cities, because Spain was in America due to religious reasons."
"Matters began to change in the 1520s with the large-scale extraction of silver from the rich deposits of Mexico's Guanajuato region, but it was the opening of the silver mines in Mexico's Zacatecas and Potosí in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia) in 1546 that became legendary."
These imports contributed to inflation in Spain and Europe from the last decades of the 16th century.
The vast imports of silver also made local manufactures uncompetitive and ultimately made Spain overly dependent on foreign sources of raw materials and manufactured goods.
"""I learnt a proverb here"", said a French traveler in 1603: ""Everything is dear in Spain except silver""."
The problems caused by inflation were discussed by scholars at the School of Salamanca and the arbitristas.
The natural resource abundance provoked a decline in entrepreneurship as profits from resource extraction are less risky.
The wealthy preferred to invest their fortunes in public debt (juros).
"The Habsburg dynasty spent the Castilian and American riches in wars across Europe on behalf of Habsburg interests, and declared moratoriums (bankruptcies) on their debt payments several times."
"These burdens led to a number of revolts across the Spanish Habsburg's domains, including their Spanish kingdoms, but the rebellions were put down."
"He was the first Habsburg monarch of Spain and co-ruler of Spain with his mother, Queen Juana."
Charles had been raised in Mechelen and his interests remained those of Christian Europe.
"While not directly an inheritance, Charles was elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire after the death of his grandfather Emperor Maximilian."
"Despite holding the imperial throne, Charles' real authority was limited by the German princes."
"They gained a strong foothold in the Empire's territories, and Charles was determined not to let this happen in the Netherlands."
"Political dissent was also firmly controlled, most notably in his place of birth, where Charles, assisted by the Duke of Alba, personally suppressed the Revolt of Ghent (1539–1540)."
"Charles abdicated as emperor in 1556 in favor of his brother Ferdinand; however, due to lengthy debate and bureaucratic procedure, the Imperial Diet did not accept the abdication (and thus make it legally valid) until 24 February 1558."
"Up to that date, Charles continued to use the title of emperor."
The overseas lands claimed by Spain in the New World proved to be a source of wealth and the crown was able to assert greater control over its overseas possessions in the political and religious spheres than was possible on Iberian peninsula or in Europe.
"The conquests of the Aztec Empire and the Inca Empire brought vast indigenous civilizations into the Spanish Empire and the mineral wealth, particularly silver, were identified and exploited, becoming the economic lifeblood of the crown."
"Under Charles, Spain and its overseas empire in the Americas became deeply entwined, with the crown enforcing Catholic exclusivity; exercising crown primacy in political rule, unencumbered by claims of an existing aristocracy; and defending its claims against other European powers."
Milan was administered by Castilian governors.
"Pope Clement VII joined forces with France and prominent Italian states against the Habsburg Emperor, resulting in the War of the League of Cognac (1526–30)."
"Charles's sack of Rome (1527) and virtual imprisonment of Pope Clement VII in 1527 prevented the Pope from annulling the marriage of Henry VIII of England and Charles's aunt Catherine of Aragon, so Henry eventually broke with Rome, thus leading to the English Reformation."
"In other respects, the war was inconclusive."
"A third war erupted in 1535, when, following the death of the last Sforza Duke of Milan, Charles installed his own son, Philip, in the duchy, despite Francis's claims on it."
"Francis failed to conquer Milan, but succeeded in conquering most of the lands of Charles's ally the Duke of Savoy, including his capital, Turin."
The crowns of Castile and Aragon depended on Genoese bankers for its finances and the Genoese fleet aided the Spanish in fighting the Ottomans in the Mediterranean.
"They had defeated the eastern Christian Byzantine empire and seized its capital, creating it as the Ottoman capital and the Ottomans controlled a rich area of the eastern Mediterranean, with links to Asia, Egypt, and India and in by the mid-sixteenth century, they ruled a third of Europe."
"The Ottomans had created an impressive land and maritime empire, with port cities and short and long range trade connections."
"Charles's great rival was Suleiman the Magnificent, whose rule almost exactly coincided with Charles's."
"A contemporary Spanish writer, Francisco López de Gómara, compared Charles unfavorably with Suleiman in the 1540s, saying that although both were wealthy and pursued war, ""the Turks succeeded better at fulfilling their projects than did the Spanish; they devoted themselves more fully to the order and discipline of war, they were better advised, they used their money more effectively."
"At the same time, Ottoman corsairs regularly devastated the Spanish and Italian coasts, crippling Spanish trade and chipping at the foundations of Habsburg power."
"Henry VIII of England, who bore a greater grudge against France than he held against Charles for standing in the way of his divorce, joined him in his invasion of France."
"Although the Spanish were defeated at the Battle of Ceresole in Savoy, the French army was unable to seriously threaten Spanish-controlled Milan, while suffering defeat in the north at the hands of Henry, thereby being forced to accept unfavorable terms."
"The Austrians, led by Charles's younger brother Ferdinand, continued to fight the Ottomans in the east."
"The presence of Spain in North Africa declined during Charles's reign, though Tunis and its port, La Goleta, were taken in 1535."
"One after another, most of the Spanish possessions were lost: Peñón de Vélez de la Gomera (1522), Santa Cruz de Mar Pequeña (1524), Algiers (1529), Tripoli (1551), and Bougie (1555)."
"Francis's defeat in 1544 led to the annulment of the alliance with the Protestants, and Charles took advantage of the opportunity."
"He first tried the path of negotiation at the Council of Trent in 1545, but the Protestant leadership, feeling betrayed by the stance taken by the Catholics at the council, went to war, led by the Saxon elector Maurice."
"In response, Charles invaded Germany at the head of a mixed Dutch–Spanish army, hoping to restore the Imperial authority."
The emperor personally inflicted a decisive defeat on the Protestants at the historic Battle of Mühlberg in 1547.
"Charles's involvement in Germany would establish a role for Spain as protector of the Catholic, Habsburg cause in the Holy Roman Empire; the precedent would lead, seven decades later, to involvement in the war that would decisively end Spain as Europe's leading power."
"The situation changed dramatically with the expedition of Hernán Cortés, who, with alliances with city-states hostile to the Aztecs and thousands of indigenous Mexican warriors, conquered the Aztec Empire (1519–1521)."
"Following the pattern established in Spain during the Reconquista and in the Caribbean, the first European settlements in the Americas, conquerors divided up the indigenous population in private holdings encomiendas and exploited their labor."
Central Mexico and later the Inca Empire of Peru gave Spain vast new indigenous populations to convert to Christianity and rule as vassals of the crown.
Charles established the Council of the Indies in 1524 to oversee all of Castile's overseas possessions.
"Charles appointed a viceroy in Mexico in 1535, capping the royal governance of the high court, Real Audiencia, and treasury officials with the highest royal official."
"Following the conquest of Peru, in 1542 Charles likewise appointed a viceroy."
Both officials were under the jurisdiction of the Council of the Indies.
Charles promulgated the New Laws of 1542 to limit the power of the conqueror group to form a hereditary aristocracy that might challenge the power of the crown.
"Philip was born in Valladolid on 21 May 1527, and was the only legitimate son of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, by his wife Isabella of Portugal."
"He did not become Holy Roman Emperor, but divided Habsburg possessions with his uncle Ferdinand."
"Philip treated Castile as the foundation of his empire, but the population of Castile was never great enough to provide the soldiers needed to defend the Empire or settlers to populate it."
"His father married him to Queen Mary I of England in 1554 to form an alliance with the English, and both Philip and Mary were Catholics, making them unpopular with the Church of England and the Protestant majority of England."
"He seized the throne of Portugal in 1580, creating the Iberian Union and bringing the entire Iberian peninsula under his personal rule."
"According to one of his biographers, it was entirely due to Philip that the Indies were brought under crown control, remaining Spanish until the wars of independence in the early nineteenth century and Catholic to the present era."
"His greatest failure was his inability to suppress the Dutch Revolt, which was aided by English and French rivals."
"His militant Catholicism also played a major role in his actions, as did his inability to understand imperial finances."
"He inherited his father's debts and incurred his own pursuing religious wars, resulting in recurring state bankruptcies and dependence on Genoese and German bankers."
"Although there was an enormous expansion of silver production in Peru and Mexico, it did not remain in the Indies or even in Spain itself, but rather much of it went to European merchant houses."
"Under Philip's rule, learned men, known as arbitristas began writing analyses of this paradox of Spain's impoverishment."
"The death of Suleiman the Magnificent the following year and his succession by his less capable son Selim the Sot emboldened Philip, who resolved to carry the war to the sultan himself."
The battle ended the threat of Ottoman naval hegemony in the Mediterranean.
The victory was aided by the participation of various military leaders and contingents from parts of Italy under Philip's rule.
"They reconquered Tunis in 1574, and they helped to restore an ally, Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik I Saadi, to the throne of Morocco, in 1576."
"The death of the Persian shah, Tahmasp I, was an opportunity for the Ottoman sultan to intervene in that country, so he agreed to a truce in the Mediterranean with Philip II in 1580."
"Larache and La Mamora, on the Moroccan Atlantic coast, and the island of Alhucemas, in the Mediterranean, were taken, but during the second half of the 17th century, Larache and La Mamora were also lost."
"The Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis, signed in 1559, permanently recognized Spanish claims in Italy."
"France was stricken for the next thirty years by chronic civil war and unrest and, during this period, removed it from effectively competing with Spain and the Habsburg family in European power games."
"Freed from effective French opposition, Spain attained the apogee of its might and territorial reach in the period 1559–1643."
These battles are generally considered to signal the start of the Eighty Years' War that ended with the independence of the United Provinces in 1648.
"The Spanish, who derived a great deal of wealth from the Netherlands and particularly from the vital port of Antwerp, were committed to restoring order and maintaining their hold on the provinces."
"According to Luc-Normand Tellier, ""It is estimated that the port of Antwerp was earning the Spanish crown seven times more revenues than the Americas."
The war dragged in the English and the French at times and expanded into the Rhineland with the Cologne War.
"Groningen, Breda, Campen, Dunkirk, Antwerp, and Brussels, among others, were put to siege."
Farnese eventually secured the Southern provinces for Spain.
The Queen of England began to aid the Northern provinces and sent troops there in 1585.
English forces under the Earl of Leicester and then Lord Willoughby faced the Spanish in the Netherlands under Farnese in a series of largely indecisive actions that tied down significant numbers of Spanish troops and bought time for the Dutch to reorganize their defenses.
The English fleet was at Plymouth and followed the Armada up the Channel.
"The first encounter was off Plymouth, 21 July, the second off Portland Bill, 23 July, the third off the Isle of Wight, 24 July."
"The fighting culminated in the Battle of Gravelines, off the coast of Flanders."
"After eight hours of intense fighting, the English ran low on ammunition and pulled back."
"Since the Spanish were trained to board enemy ships and fight hand-to-hand, their cannons were not designed to be fired repeatedly."
"While the Spanish fleet had sailed with 2,431 cannons, many were intended for a ground assault after landing and were useless for naval battles."
"Through a week of fighting the Spanish had expended upwards of 125,000 cannonballs, but no English ship was seriously damaged."
"However, typhus spread fast aboard the English vessels; large numbers of English sailors died of disease or hunger, and, of the few who did survive, some died even after landing at Margate."
"As the Channel was blocked off, the Spanish commander Medina Sidonia decided to circle around Scotland and Ireland and retreat back to Spain."
"By the time the fleet arrived in Ireland, many soldiers were dying of thirst and hunger, as they had run out of supplies."
"Many of the surviving ships were caught in fierce storms off the west coast of Ireland, and dozens of Spanish ships were wrecked and thousands drowned or were robbed and butchered by Irish locals or English soldiers when they reached the shore."
"Only the Spanish nobles were spared, kept prisoner for ransom."
"The defeat of the Armada saved Protestant England from a Catholic reconquest, and the situation in the Netherlands became increasingly difficult to manage."
"Maurice of Nassau, William's son, recaptured Deventer, Groningen, Nijmegen and Zutphen."
"The Spanish were on the defensive, mainly because they had wasted too much resources on the attempted invasion of England and on expeditions in northern France."
"In 1595, King Henry IV of France declared war on Spain, further reducing Spain's ability to launch offensive warfare on the United Provinces."
"Faced with wars against France, England and the United Provinces, each led by capable leaders, the bankrupted Spanish empire found itself competing against strong adversaries."
Continuing piracy against its shipping in the Atlantic and costly colonial enterprises forced Spain to renegotiate its debts in 1596.
"The crown attempted to reduce its exposure to the conflicts, first signing the Treaty of Vervins with France in 1598, restoring many of the stipulations of the previous Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis."
Philip ceded the Spanish Netherlands to his daughter Isabella.
"Although the Council of the Indies was tasked with oversight there, it acted without advice of high officials with direct colonial experience."
Another serious problem was that the crown did not know what Spanish laws were in force there.
"To remedy the situation, Philip appointed Juan de Ovando, who was named President of the council, to give advice."
"Ovando appointed a ""chronicler and cosmographer of the Indies,"" Juan López de Velasco, to gather information about the crown's holdings, which resulted in the Relaciones geográficas in the 1580s."
"The crown sought greater control over encomenderos, who had attempted to establish themselves as a local aristocracy; strengthened the power of the ecclesiastical hierarchy; shored up religious orthodoxy by the establishment of the Inquisition in Lima and Mexico City (1571); and increased revenues from silver mines in Peru and in Mexico, discovered in the 1540s."
"In Peru, after decades of political unrest, with ineffective viceroys and encomenderos wielding undue power, weak royal institutions, a renegade Inca state existing in Vilcabamba, and waning revenue from the silver mine of Potosí, Toledo's appointment was a major step forward for royal control."
"He built on reforms attempted under earlier viceroys, but he is often credited with a major transformation in crown rule in Peru."
"Toledo formalized the labor draft of Andean commoners, the mita, to guarantee a labor supply for both the silver mine at Potosí and the mercury mine at Huancavelica."
"He established administrative districts of corregimiento, and resettled native Andeans in reducciones to better rule them."
"Under Toledo, the last stronghold of the Inca state was destroyed and the last Inca emperor, Tupac Amaru I, was executed."
Silver from Potosí flowed to coffers in Spain and paid for Spain's wars in Europe.
"In Mexico, Viceroy Enríquez organized the defense of the northern frontier against nomadic and bellicose indigenous groups, who attacked the transport lines of silver from the northern mines."
"In the religious sphere, the crown sought to bring the power of the religious orders under control with the Ordenanza del Patronazgo, ordering friars to give up their Indian parishes and turn them over to the diocesan clergy, who were more closely controlled by the crown."
The crown expanded its global claims and defended existing ones in the Indies.
Transpacific explorations had resulted in Spain claiming the Philippines and the establishment of Spanish settlements and trade with Mexico.
"The viceroyalty of Mexico was given jurisdiction over the Philippines, which became the entrepôt for Asian trade."
"Philip's succession to the crown of Portugal in 1580 complicated the situation on the ground in the Indies between Spanish and Portuguese settlers, although Brazil and Spanish America were administered through separate councils in Spain."
"Spain dealt with English encroachment on Spain's maritime control in the Indies, particularly by Sir Francis Drake and his cousin John Hawkins."
Spain regained control in the Isthmus of Panama by relocating the main port there from Nombre de Dios to Portobelo.
"In 1564, Miguel López de Legazpi was commissioned by the viceroy of New Spain (Mexico), Don Luís de Velasco, to lead an expedition in the Pacific Ocean to find the Spice Islands, where earlier explorers Ferdinand Magellan and Ruy López de Villalobos had landed in 1521 and 1543, respectively."
The westward sailing to reach the sources of spices continued to be a necessity with the Ottomans still controlled major choke points in central Asia.
It was unclear how the agreement between Spain and Portugal dividing the Atlantic world affected finds on the other side of the Pacific.
"Spain had ceded its rights to the ""Spice Islands"" to Portugal in the Treaty of Saragossa in 1529, but the appellation was vague as was their exact delineation."
"The Legazpi expedition was ordered by King Philip II, after whom the Philippines had earlier been named by Ruy López de Villalobos, when Philip was heir to the throne."
"The king stated that ""the main purpose of this expediiton is to establish the return route from the western isles, since it is already known that the route to them is fairly short."""
"The viceroy died in July 1564, but the Audiencia and López de Legazpi completed the preparations for the expedition."
"On embarking on the expedition, Spain lacked maps or information to guide the king's decision to authorize the expedition."
"That realization subsequently led to the creation of reports from the various regions of the empire, the relaciones geográficas."
"The Philippines came under the jurisdiction of the viceroyalty of Mexico, and once the Manila Galleon sailings between Manila and Acapulco were established, Mexico became the Philippines' link to the larger Spanish Empire."
Spanish colonization began in earnest when López de Legazpi arrived from Mexico in 1565 and formed the first settlements in Cebu.
"Beginning with just five ships and five hundred men accompanied by Augustinian friars, and further strengthened in 1567 by two hundred soldiers, he was able to repel the Portuguese and create the foundations for the colonization of the archipelago."
The combined Spanish-Mexican-Filipino forces also built a Christian walled city over the burnt ruins of Muslim Maynila and made it as the new capital of the Spanish East Indies and renamed it Manila.
Spaniards were few and life was difficult and they were often outnumbered by their Latino recruits and Filipino allies.
They attempted to mobilize subordinated populations through the encomienda.
"Unlike in the Caribbean where the indigenous populations rapidly disappeared, the indigenous populations continued to be robust in the Philippines."
"Maynila's former ruler, the Muslim rajah, Rajah Sulayman, who was a vassal to the Sultan of Brunei, refused to submit to Legazpi but failed to get the support of Lakan Dula or of the Pampangan and Pangasinan settlements to the north."
"When Tarik Sulayman and a force of Kapampangan and Tagalog Muslim warriors attacked the Spaniards in the Battle of Bangkusay, he was finally defeated and killed."
The Spanish also repelled an attack by Chinese pirate warlord Limahong.
"Simultaneously, the establishment of a Christianized Philippines attracted Chinese traders who exchanged their silk for Mexican silver, Indian and Malay traders also settled in the Philippines too, to trade their spices and gems for the same Mexican silver."
The Philippines then became a center for Christian missionary activity that was also directed to Japan and the Philippines even accepted Christian converts from Japan after the Shogun persecuted them.
Most of the soldiers and settlers sent by the Spanish to the Philippines were either from Mexico or Peru and very little people directly came from Spain.
"The Spanish were joined by the newly Christianized Non-Muslim Visayans of the Kedatuan of Madja-as who were Animists and Rajahnate of Cebu who were Hindus, plus the Rajahnate of Butuan (who were from northern Mindanao and were Hindus with a Buddhist Monarchy), as well as the remnants of the Kedatuan of Dapitan who are also Animists and had previously waged war against the Islamic nations of the Sultanate of Sulu and Kingdom of Maynila."
"They fought against the Sultanate of Brunei and its allies, the Bruneian puppet-states of Maynila and Sulu, which had dynastic links with Brunei."
"The Spanish, its Mexican recruits and Filipino allies assaulted Brunei and seized its capital, Kota Batu."
"This was achieved partly as a result of the assistance of two noblemen, Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna."
"The former had traveled to Manila to offer Brunei as a tributary of Spain for help to recover the throne usurped by his brother, Saiful Rijal."
"The Spanish agreed that if they succeeded in conquering Brunei, Pengiran Seri Lela would indeed become the Sultan, while Pengiran Seri Ratna would be the new Bendahara."
"The expedition consisted of 400 Spaniards and Mexicans, 1,500 Filipino natives and 300 Borneans."
"The campaign was one of many, which also included action in Mindanao and Sulu."
"The Spanish succeeded in invading the capital on 16 April 1578, with the help of Pengiran Seri Lela and Pengiran Seri Ratna."
Sultan Saiful Rijal and Paduka Seri Begawan Sultan Abdul Kahar were forced to flee to Meragang then to Jerudong.
"In Jerudong, they made plans to chase the conquering army away from Brunei."
The Spanish suffered heavy losses due to a cholera or dysentery outbreak.
"They were so weakened by the illness that they decided to abandon Brunei to return to Manila on 26 June 1578, after just 72 days."
Its failure resulted in the hanging of Agustín de Legaspi and the execution of Magat Salamat (the crown-prince of Tondo).
"Thereafter, some of the conspirators were exiled to Guam or Guerrero, Mexico."
"The Spanish then conducted the centuries long Spanish–Moro conflict against the Sultanates of Maguindanao, Lanao and Sulu."
War was also waged against the Sultanate of Ternate and Tidore (in response to Ternatean slaving and piracy against Spain's allies: Bohol and Butuan).
"During the Spanish–Moro conflict, the Moros of Muslim Mindanao conducted piracy and slave-raids against Christian settlements in the Philippines."
The Spanish fought back by establishing Christian fort-cities such as Zamboanga City on Muslim Mindanao.
"The Spanish considered their war with the Muslims in Southeast Asia an extension of the Reconquista, a centuries-long campaign to retake and rechristianize the Spanish homeland which was invaded by the Muslims of the Umayyad Caliphate."
"Some 120 Spaniards, Japanese, and Filipinos, sailing aboard three junks, launched an expedition to Cambodia."
"After an altercation between the Spanish expedition members and some Chinese merchants at the port left a few Chinese dead, the Spanish were forced to confront the newly declared king Anacaparan, burning much of his capital while defeating him."
"Another expedition, one to conquer Mindanao, was also lacking in success."
Philip asserted his claim to the Portuguese throne and in June sent the Duke of Alba with an army to Lisbon to assure his succession.
"The Duke of Alba's Spanish army defeated the Portuguese at the Battle of Alcântara on 25 August 1580, and Alba conquered the capital of Lisbon two days later."
"Filippo di Piero Strozzi, a Florentine mercenary, clashed with Bazán at the Battle of Ponta Delgada, off the island of São Miguel, but was defeated and killed."
The combined Spanish and Portuguese empires placed into Philip's hands included almost the entirety of the explored New World along with a vast trading empire in Africa and Asia.
"""Sea power is more important to the ruler of Spain than any other prince"", wrote one commentator, ""for it is only by sea power that a single community can be created out of so many so far apart."""
"A writer on tactics in 1638 observed, ""The might most suited to the arms of Spain is that which is placed on the seas, but this matter of state is so well known that I should not discuss it, even if I thought it opportune to do so."""
"Portugal and her kingdoms, including Brazil and her African colonies, were under the dominion of the Spanish monarch."
"Portugal required an extensive occupation force to keep it under control, and Spain was still reeling from the 1576 bankruptcy."
Portugal was brought into Spain's conflicts with rivals.
"Parma had suggested transporting 30,000 troops in Flanders across the English Channel to invade England."
"Unfavorable weather, plus heavily armed and manœuvrable English ships, and the fact that the English had been warned by their spies in the Netherlands and were ready for the attack resulted in a defeat for the Spanish Armada."
"However, the failure of the Drake–Norris Expedition to Portugal and the Azores in 1589 marked a turning point in the on-off 1585–1604 Anglo–Spanish War."
"In 1591, Spain reasserted its naval superiority at the Battle of Flores, when an attempt to capture its treasure fleet was thwarted."
"The Spanish fleets became more effective in transporting greatly increased quantities of silver and gold from the Americas, while English attacks suffered costly failures."
"During the reign of Philip IV (Philip III of Portugal) in 1640, the Portuguese revolted and fought for their independence from the rest of Iberia."
The Council of Portugal was subsequently dissolved.
"Philip sought to reduce foreign conflicts, since even the vast revenues could not sustain the nearly bankrupted kingdom."
"The plague devastated Castilian lands between 1596 and 1602, causing the deaths of some 600,000 people."
A great number of Castilians went to America or died on Dutch and German battlefields.
"In 1609, the great majority of the Morisco population of Spain (much more numerous and unassimilated in the kingdoms of Valencia and Aragon, than in the Crown of Castile or the Principality of Catalonia) was expelled."
It is estimated that Castile lost about 25% of its population between 1600 and 1623.
"The Dutch, led by Maurice of Nassau, the son of William the Silent and perhaps the greatest strategist of his time, had succeeded in taking a number of border cities since 1590, including the fortress of Breda."
"However, the Genoese nobleman Ambrogio Spinola, commanding an army of mercenary Italian troops, fought in the name of Spain and repeatedly defeated the Dutchmen."
He was prevented from conquering the Netherlands only by Spain's latest bankruptcy in 1607.
"In 1609, the Twelve Years' Truce was signed between Spain and the United Provinces."
"Spain made a fair recovery during the truce, putting its finances in order and doing much to restore its prestige and stability in the run-up to the last truly great war in which she would play a leading part."
"The Duke of Lerma (and to a large extent Philip II) had been uninterested in the affairs of their ally, Austria."
"In 1618, the king replaced him with Don Baltasar de Zúñiga, a veteran ambassador to Vienna."
Don Balthasar believed that the key to restraining the resurgent French and eliminating the Dutch was a closer alliance with Habsburg Monarchy.
"In 1618, beginning with the Defenestration of Prague, Austria and the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, embarked on a campaign against the Protestant Union and Bohemia."
"Don Balthasar encouraged Philip to join the Austrian Habsburgs in the war, and Spinola, the rising star of the Spanish army in the Netherlands, was sent at the head of the Army of Flanders to intervene."
"Thus, Spain entered into the Thirty Years' War."
The learned arbitristas sent the king more analyses of Spain's problems and possible solutions.
"As an illustration of the precarious economic situation of Spain at the time, it was actually Dutch bankers who financed the East India merchants of Seville."
"At the same time, everywhere in the world Dutch entrepreneurship and settlements were undermining Spanish and Portuguese hegemony."
"The Dutch were religiously tolerant and not evangelical, focusing on trade, as opposed to Spain's longstanding defense of Catholicism."
Spain badly needed time and peace to repair its finances and to rebuild its economy.
"In 1622, Don Balthasar was replaced by Gaspar de Guzmán, Count-Duke of Olivares, a reasonably honest and able man."
"After certain initial setbacks, the Bohemians were defeated at White Mountain in 1621, and again at Stadtlohn in 1623."
The war with the Netherlands was renewed in 1621 with Spinola taking the fortress of Breda in 1625.
"The intervention of Christian IV of Denmark in the war threatened the Spanish position, but the victory of the Imperial general Albert of Wallenstein over the Danes at Dessau Bridge and again at Lutter (both in 1626), eliminated that threat."
"There was hope in Madrid that the Netherlands might finally be reincorporated into the Empire, and after the defeat of Denmark the Protestants in Germany seemed crushed."
"France was once again involved in its own instabilities, and Spain's eminence seemed clear."
"Olivares aimed for ""peace with honor"", however, which meant in practice a peace settlement that would have restored to Spain something of its predominant position in the Netherlands."
"This was unacceptable to the United Provinces, and the inevitable consequence was the constant hope that one more victory would finally lead to ""peace with honor"", perpetuating the ruinous war that Olivares had wanted to avoid to begin with."
"In 1625, Olivares proposed the Union of Arms, which aimed at raising revenues from the Indies and other kingdoms of Iberia for imperial defense, which met strong opposition."
The Union of Arms was the sparking point for a major revolt in Catalonia in 1640.
"This turmoil also seemed a propitious moment for the Portuguese to revolt against Habsburg rule, with the Duke of Braganza proclaimed as John IV of Portugal."
"While Spinola and the Spanish army were focused on the Netherlands, the war seemed to go in Spain's favor."
But in 1627 the Castilian economy collapsed.
"The Habsburg had been debasing their currency to pay for the war and prices exploded, just as they had in previous years in Austria."
"Until 1631, parts of Castile operated on a barter economy owing to the currency crisis, and the government was unable to collect any meaningful taxes from the peasantry and had to depend on revenue from its colonies."
"The Spanish armies, like others in German territories, resorted to ""paying themselves"" on the land."
"Olivares had backed certain taxation reforms in Spain pending the end of the war, but was blamed for another embarrassing and fruitless war in Italy."
"The Dutch, who during the Twelve Years' Truce had made increasing their navy a priority, (which showed its maturing potency at the Battle of Gibraltar 1607), managed to strike a great blow against Spanish maritime trade with the capture by captain Piet Hein of the Spanish treasure fleet on which Spain had become dependent after the economic collapse."
"Spanish military resources were stretched across Europe and also at sea as they sought to protect maritime trade against the greatly improved Dutch and French fleets, while still occupied with the Ottoman and associated Barbary pirate threat in the Mediterranean."
In the meantime the aim of choking Dutch shipping was carried out by the Dunkirkers with considerable success.
"In 1625 a Spanish-Portuguese fleet, under Admiral Fadrique de Toledo, regained the strategically vital Brazilian city of Salvador da Bahia from the Dutch."
"Elsewhere, the isolated and undermanned Portuguese forts in Africa and Asia proved vulnerable to Dutch and English raids and takeovers or simply being bypassed as important trading posts."
"In 1630, Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, one of history's most noted commanders, landed in Germany and relieved the port of Stralsund, the last continental stronghold of German forces belligerent to the Emperor."
"Gustavus then marched south and won notable victories at Breitenfeld and Lützen, attracting more Protestant support with every step he took."
By 1633 Spain was deeply involved in saving their Austrian allies from the Swedes who had continued to be wildly successful despite the death of Gustavus at Lützen in 1632.
"In early September 1634, a Spanish army that had marched from Italy linked with the Imperials at the town of Nördlingen, bringing their total to 33,000 troops."
"Having severely underestimated the number of experienced Spanish soldiers in the reinforcements, the commanders of the Protestant armies of the Heilbronn League decided to offer battle."
The seasoned Spanish infantry — which had not been present at any of the battles that had ended in Swedish victories — was mostly responsible for the complete rout of the enemy army.
"Alarmed by the Spanish success at the Battle of Nördlingen and the probable collapse of the Swedish military effort, Cardinal Richelieu, the chief minister of Louis XIII, realized that it would be necessary to turn the existing cold war into a hot one if Spain, in conjunction with the Austrian Habsburgs, was to be stopped from dominating Europe."
"The French won the Battle of Les Avins in Belgium on 20 May 1635, an early success, but the Spanish defeated a joint Franco-Dutch invasion of the Spanish Netherlands before Spanish and Imperial armies cut through Picardy, Burgundy, and Champagne."
"However, the Spanish offensive stalled before Paris could be targeted, and the French launched counterattacks that drove the Spanish back into Flanders."
"In February 1637, Admiral Miguel de Horna, commander of the Armada of Flanders, fought a bloody battle with a Dutch convoy met off the coast of Cornwall, capturing fourteen merchantmen and three warships."
"In August, Salvador Rodríguez led a raid on the Shetland fishing grounds, which took a toll of thirty-five herring busses."
"At the Battle of the Downs in 1639, a large Spanish fleet (100 ships; 2,000 guns; 20,000 men) was destroyed off the coast of Kent by the Dutch, and the Spanish found themselves unable to supply and reinforce their forces adequately in the Netherlands."
"According to Geoffrey Parker, the Army of Flanders received 8,000 Castilian reinforcements each year during the Eighty Years' War, and 30,000 Castilian soldiers were mobilized between 1631 and 1639."
"In 1643, the Army of Flanders, commanded by Francisco de Melo, suffered defeat in northern France at the Battle of Rocroi."
The battle was one of the few major battlefield defeats of a Spanish army in over a century.
"The Peace of Westphalia ended the Spanish-Dutch War in 1648, with Spain recognizing the independence of the Seven United Provinces of the Netherlands."
The Spanish had to be paid to leave positions they had seized on the Rhine.
"The Franco-Spanish War continued for eleven more years, in the course of which England joined in on the side of France."
"In 1640, Spain had already experienced the loss of Portugal, following its revolt against Spanish rule, and brought to an end the Iberian Union, and the establishment of the House of Braganzaunder king John IV of Portugal."
"He had received widespread support from the Portuguese people, and Spain was unable to respond, since it was at war with France and Catalonia revolted that year."
"When John died in 1656, the Spanish attempted to wrest Portugal from his son Alfonso VI of Portugal but were defeated at the Battle of Ameixial (1663) and the Battle of Montes Claros (1665), leading to Spain's recognition of Portugal's independence in 1668, during the regency of Philip IV's young heir, Charles II, who was seven at the time."
"Although France suffered from a civil war from 1648 to 1652, Spain had been exhausted by the Thirty Years' War and the ongoing revolts."
"With the war against the United Provinces at an end in 1648, the Spanish drove the French out of Naples and Catalonia in 1652, recaptured Dunkirk, and occupied several northern French forts that they held until peace was made."
"The war came to an end soon after the Battle of the Dunes (1658), where the French army under Viscount Turenne retook Dunkirk."
Spain agreed to the Peace of the Pyrenees in 1659 that ceded to France the Spanish Netherlands territory of Artois and the northern Catalan county of Roussillon.
"France was now the dominant power on continental Europe, and the United Provinces were dominant in the Atlantic."
"Sevilla, and indeed the economy of Andalucía, would never recover from such complete devastation."
"Although the islands' loss barely diminished its American territories, the islands were strategically located and held political, military, and economic advantages in the long run."
"Spain's main Caribbean strongholds of Cuba and Puerto Rico remained in crown hands, but Windward Islands and Leeward Islands which Spain claimed but did not occupy were vulnerable."
"The French settled in the West Indies in Martinique and Guadeloupe in 1635; and the Dutch acquired trading bases in Curaçao, St Eustace, and St Martin."
"Charles became monarch in 1665 when he was four years old, so a regency of his mother and a five-member government junta ruled in his name, headed by his natural half-brother John of Austria."
"French forces led by the Duke of Luxembourg defeated the Spanish at Fleurus (1690) and subsequently defeated Dutch forces under William III of Orange, who fought on Spain's side."
"The war ended with most of the Spanish Netherlands under French occupation, including the important cities of Ghent and Luxembourg."
The war revealed to Europe the vulnerability of the Spanish defenses and bureaucracy.
"Further, the ineffective Spanish Habsburg government took no action to improve them."
Spain suffered utter decay and stagnation during the final decades of the seventeenth century.
While the rest of Western Europe went through exciting changes in government and society – the Glorious Revolution in England and the reign of the Sun King in France – Spain remained adrift.
"The Spanish bureaucracy that had built up around the charismatic, industrious, and intelligent Charles I and Philip II demanded a strong and hardworking monarch; the weakness and lack of interest of Philip III and Philip IV contributed to Spain's decay."
"Charles II was childless and weak ruler, known as ""The Bewitched."""
"In his last will and testament he left his throne to a French prince, the Bourbon Philip of Anjou, rather than to another Habsburg."
"This resulted in the War of the Spanish Succession, with the Habsburg Monarchy, the Dutch and the English challenging Charles II's choice of a Bourbon prince to succeed him as king."
"When these territories reach a high level of importance, the crown established the Council of the Indies in 1524, following the conquest of the Aztec empire, asserting permanent royal control over its possessions."
"Regions with dense indigenous populations and sources of mineral wealth attracting Spanish settlers became colonial centers, while those without such resources were peripheral to crown interest."
"Once regions incorporated into the empire and their importance assessed, overseas possessions came under stronger or weaker crown control."
"The crown learned its lesson with the rule of Christopher Columbus and his heirs in the Caribbean, and they never subsequently gave authorization of sweeping powers to explorers and conquerors."
"The Catholic Monarchs' conquest of Granada in 1492 and their expulsion of the Jews ""were militant expressions of religious statehood at the moment of the beginning of the American colonization."""
"The crown's power in the religious sphere was absolute in its overseas possessions through the papacy's grant of the Patronato real, and ""Catholicism was indissolubly linked with royal authority."""
"Church-State relations were established in the conquest era and remained stable until the end of the Habsburg era in 1700, when the Bourbon monarchs implemented major reforms and changed the relationship between crown and altar."
"The crown's administration of its overseas empire was implemented by royal officials in both the civil and religious spheres, often with overlapping jurisdictions."
The crown could administer the empire in the Indies by using native elites as intermediaries with the large indigenous populations.
"Administrative costs of empire were kept low, with a small number of Spanish officials generally paid low salaries."
"Crown policy to maintain a closed commercial system limited to one port in Spain and only a few in the Indies was in practice not closed, with European merchant houses supplying Spanish merchants in the Spanish port of Seville with high quality textiles and other manufactured goods that Spain itself could not supply."
Much of the silver of the Indies was diverted into those European merchant houses.
Crown officials in the Indies enabled the creation of a whole commercial system in which they could coerce native populations to participate while reaping profits themselves in cooperation with merchants.
"This territory later became the Viceroyalty of New Spain, present day Mexico."
"Of equal importance was the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire by Francisco Pizarro, which would become the Viceroyalty of Peru."
"After the conquest of Mexico, rumors of golden cities (Quivira and Cíbola in North America and El Dorado in South America) motivated several other expeditions."
"Many of those returned without having found their goal, or finding it much less valuable than was hoped."
"Indeed, the New World colonies only began to yield a substantial part of the Crown's revenues with the establishment of mines such as that of Potosí (Bolivia) and Zacatecas (Mexico) both started in 1546."
"By the late 16th century, silver from the Americas accounted for one-fifth of Spain's total budget."
Eventually the world's stock of precious metal was doubled or even tripled by silver from the Americas.
Official records indicate that at least 75% of the silver was taken across the Atlantic to Spain and no more than 25% across the Pacific to China.
Some modern researchers argue that due to rampant smuggling about 50% went to China.
Saint Augustine quickly became a strategic defensive base for the Spanish ships full of gold and silver being sent to Spain from its New World dominions.
"The Portuguese mariner sailing for Castile, Ferdinand Magellan, died while in the Philippines commanding a Castilian expedition in 1522, which was the first to circumnavigate the globe."
The Basque commander Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition to success.
"Spain sought to enforce their rights in the Moluccan islands, which led a conflict with the Portuguese, but the issue was resolved with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1525), settling the location of the antimeridian of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres."
"From then on, maritime expeditions led to the discovery of several archipelagos in the South Pacific as the Pitcairn Islands, the Marquesas, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands or New Guinea, to which Spain laid claim."
"Most important in Pacific exploration was the claim on the Philippines, which was populous and strategically located for the Spanish settlement of Manila and entrepôt for trade with China."
The Manila Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to Acapulco on the coast of Mexico.
"From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the Spanish treasure fleets, for shipment to Spain."
The Spanish trading port of Manila facilitated this trade in 1572.
"Although Spain claimed islands in the Pacific, it did not encounter or claim the Hawaiian Islands."
"The control of Guam, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, and Palau came later, from the end of the 17th century, and remained under Spanish control until 1898."
"In the 18th century, Spain was concerned with increasing Russian and British influence in the Pacific Northwest of North America and sent several expeditions to explore and further shore up Spanish claims to the region."
"Royal law and Catholicism codified and maintained hierarchies of class and race , while all were subjects of the crown and mandated to be Catholic."
"The crown took active steps to establish and maintain Catholicism by evangelizing the pagan indigenous populations, as well as African slaves not previously Christian, and incorporating them into Christendom."
The Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spanish America.
"The crown also imposed restrictions on emigration to the Americas, excluding Jews and crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners, using the Casa de Contratación to vet potential emigres and issue licenses to travel."
The portrait to the right was most likely used as a souvenir.
For those who traveled to the New World and back it was common to bring back souvenirs as there were a great interest in what the New World meant.
The land would be significantly different but there was a special emphasis put on the emerging mixed races.
Not only was there whites mixing with blacks but there were natives mixing with both whites and blacks as well.
"From a Spanish viewpoint, the castas paintings would most-likely have provided a sort of sense to the madness that was mixed races."
There were political implications of this portrait as well.
"Once those issues were resolved theologically, in practice the crown sought to protect its new vassals."
"It did so by dividing peoples of the Americas into the República de Indios, the native populations, and the República de Españoles."
"The República de Españoles was the entire Hispanic sector, composed of Spaniards, but also Africans (enslaved and free), as well as mixed-race castas."
"Within the República de Indios, men were explicitly excluded from ordination to the Catholic priesthood and obligation for military service as well as the jurisdiction of the Inquisition."
Indians under colonial rule who lived in pueblos de indios had crown protections due to their statuses as legal minors.
"Due to the lack of prior exposure to the Catholic faith, Queen Isabella had declared all indigenous peoples her subjects."
This differed from people of the African continent because these populations had theoretically been exposed to Catholicism and chose not to follow it.
This religious differentiation is important because it gave indigenous communities legal protections from members of the Républica de Españoles.
"In fact, an often overlooked aspect of the colonial legal system was that members of the pueblos de indios could appeal to the crown and circumvent the legal system in the Républica de Españoles."
"The statuses of the indigenous populations as legal minors barred them from becoming priests, but the républica de indios operated with a fair amount of autonomy."
Missionaries also acted as guardians against encomendero exploitation.
"Indian communities had protections of traditional lands by the creation of community lands that could not be alienated, the fondo legal."
"They managed their own affairs internally through Indian town government under the supervision of royal officials, the corregidores and alcaldes mayores."
"Although indigenous men were barred from becoming priests, indigenous communities created religious confraternaties under priestly supervision, which functioned as burial societies for their individual members, but also organized community celebrations for their patron saint."
"The first order to make the trip to the Americas were the Franciscans, led by Pedro de Gante."
Franciscans believed that living a spiritual life of poverty and holiness was the best way to be an example that inspired others to convert.
The friars would walk into the towns barefoot as a display of their surrender to God in a sort of theater of conversion.
With this began the practice of evangelization of the peoples of the new world as supported by the Spanish government.
"Religious orders in Spanish America had their own internal structures and were organizationally autonomous, but nonetheless were very important to the structure of colonial society."
They had their own resources and hierarchies.
"Though some orders took vows of poverty, by the time the second wave of friars came to the Americas and as their numbers grew, the orders began amassing wealth and thus became key economic players."
"The church, as this wealthy power, had huge estates and built large constructions such as gilded monasteries and cathedrals."
Priests themselves also became wealthy landowners.
"Orders like the Franciscans also established schools for the indigenous elites as well as hired indigenous laborers, thereby shifting the dynamics in the indigenous communities and their relationship to the Spanish."
"After the fall of the Aztec and Inca empires, the rulers of the empires were replaced by the Spanish monarchy, while retaining much of the hierarchical indigenous structures."
"The crown recognized noble status of elite Indians, giving them exemption from the head-tax and the right to use the nobles title don and doña."
"Indigenous noblemen were a key group for the administration of the Spanish Empire, since they served as intermediaries between crown officials and indigenous communities."
"Indigenous noblemen could serve on cabildos, ride horses, and carry firearms."
The crown's recognition of indigenous elites as nobles meant that these men were incorporated into colonial system with privileges separating them from Indian commoners.
Indian noblemen were thus crucial to the governance of the huge indigenous population.
"Through their continued loyalty to the crown, they maintained their positions of power within their communities but also served as agents of colonial governance."
The Spanish Empire's utilization of local elites to rule large populations that are ethnically distinct from the rulers has long been practiced by earlier empires.
"Indian caciques were crucial in the early Spanish period, especially when the economy was still based on extracting tribute and labor from commoner Indians who had rendered goods and service to their overlords in the prehispanic period."
"Caciques mobilized their populations for encomenderos and, later, repartimiento recipients chosen by the crown."
"The noblemen became the officers of the cabildo in indigenous communities, regulating internal affairs, as well as defending the communities’ rights in court."
"In Mexico, this was facilitated by the 1599 establishment of the General Indian Court (Juzgado General de Indios), which heard legal disputes in which indigenous communities and individuals were engaged."
"With legal mechanisms for dispute-resolution, there were relatively few outbreaks of violence and rebellion against crown rule."
"Eighteenth-century rebellions in long-peaceful areas of Mexico, the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 and most spectacularly in Peru with the Tupac Amaru Rebellion (1780–81) saw indigenous noblemen leading uprisings against the Spanish state."
"In the República de Españoles, class and race hierarchies were codified in institutional structures."
"Spaniards emigrating to The Indies were to be Old Christians of pure Christian heritage, with the crown excluding New Christians, converts from Judaism and their descendants, because of their suspect religious status."
"The crown established the Inquisition in Mexico and Peru in 1571, and later Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), to guard Catholics from the influence of crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners."
"Church practices established and maintained racial hierarchies  by recording baptism, marriage, and burial were kept separate registers for different racial groups."
Churches were also physically divided by race.
"Race mixture (mestizaje) was a fact of colonial society, with the three racial groups, European whites (españoles), Africans (negros), and Indians (indios) producing mixed-race offspring, or castas."
"There was a pyramid of racial status  with the apex being the small number of European white (españoles), a slightly larger number of mixed-race castas, who, like the whites were mainly urban dwelling, and the largest populations were Indians living in communities in the countryside."
"Although Indians were classified as part of the Repúbica de Indios, their offspring of unions with Españoles and Africans were castas."
"White-Indian mixtures were more socially acceptable in the Hispanic sphere, with the possibility over generations of mixed-race offspring being classified as Español."
"Any offspring with African ancestry could never remove the ""stain"" of their racial heritage, since Africans were seen as ""natural slaves."""
"Non-whites (blacks and mixed-race castas) were far more often and more severely punished , while Indians, considered legal minors, were not expected to behave better and were more leniently punished."
"Royal and municipal legislation attempted to control the behavior of black slaves, who were subject to a curfew, could not carry arms, and were prohibited from running away from their masters."
"As the urban, white, lower-class (plebeian) population increased, they too were increasingly subject to criminal arrest and punishment."
"Capital punishment was seldom employed, with the exception of sodomy and recalcitrant prisoners of the Inquisition, whose deviation from Christian orthodoxy was considered extreme."
"However, only the civil sphere could exercise capital punishment and prisoners were ""relaxed,"" that is, released to civil authorities."
"Often criminals served sentences of hard labor in textile workshops (obrajes), presidio service on the frontier, and as sailors on royal ships."
One important privilege was their being judged by the court of their corporation.
"Members of the clergy held the fuero eclesiástico were judged by ecclesiastical courts, whether the offense was civil or criminal."
"In the eighteenth century the crown established a standing military and with it, special privileges (fuero militar)."
The privilege extended to the military was the first fuero extended to the non-whites who served the crown.
Indians had a form of corporate privilege through their membership in indigenous communities.
"In central Mexico, the crown established a special Indian court (Juzgado General de Indios), and legal fees, including access to lawyers, were funded by a special tax."
"The crown extended the peninsular institution of the merchant guild (consulado) first established in Spain, including Seville (1543), and later established in Mexico City and Peru."
"Consulado membership was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards, usually members of transatlantic commercial houses."
"The consulados’ tribunals heard disputes over contracts, bankruptcy, shipping, insurance and the like and became a wealthy and powerful economic institution and source of loans to the viceroyalties."
Transatlantic trade remained in the hands of mercantile families based in Spain and the Indies.
"The men in the Indies were often younger relatives of the merchants in Spain, who often married wealthy American-born women."
"American-born Spanish men (criollos) in general did not pursue commerce but instead owned landed estates, entered the priesthood, or became a professional."
"In the Bourbon era, for the first time there was a distinction made between Iberian-born and American-born Spaniards, In the Habsburg era, in law and ordinary speech they were grouped together without distinction."
"Increasingly American-born Spaniards developed a distinctly local focus, with peninsular-born (peninsulares) Spaniards increasingly seen as outsiders and resented, but this was a development in the late colonial period."
"Resentment against peninsulares was due to a deliberate change in crown policy, which systematically favored them over American-born criollos for high positions in the civil and religious hierarchies."
This left criollos only the membership in a city or town's cabildo.
"When the secularizing Bourbon monarchy pursued policies strengthening secular royal power over religious power, it attacked the fuero eclesiástico, which for many members of the lower clergy was a significant privilege."
Parish priests who had functioned as royal officials as well as clerics in Indian towns lost their privileged position.
"At the same time the crown established a standing army and promoted militias for the defense of empire, creating a new avenue of privilege for creole men and for castas, but excluding indigenous men from conscription or voluntary service."
"Given that, the crown attempted to create and maintain a classic, closed mercantile system, warding off competitors and keeping wealth within the empire."
"While the Habsburgs were committed to maintaining a state monopoly in theory, in reality the Empire was a porous economic realm and smuggling was widespread."
"In the 16th and 17th century under the Habsburgs, Spain experienced a gradual decline in economic conditions, especially relative to the industrial development of its French, Dutch, and English rivals."
"Many of the goods being exported to the Empire originated from manufacturers in northwest Europe, rather than in Spain."
But illicit commercial activities became a part of the Empire's administrative structure.
"Supported by large flows of silver from America, trade prohibited by Spanish mercantilist trade restrictions flourished, because it provided a source of income to both crown officials and private merchants."
"The local administrative structure in Buenos Aires, for example, was established through its oversight of both legal and illegal commerce."
In the eighteenth century the crown attempted to reverse course under the Bourbon monarchs.
"The crown's pursuit of wars to maintain and expand territory, defend the Catholic faith and stamp out Protestantism, and beat back Ottoman Turkish strength outstripped its ability to pay for it all, despite the huge production of silver in Peru and Mexico."
Most of that flow paid mercenary soldiers in the European religious wars in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and into foreign merchants’ hands to pay for the consumer goods manufactured in northern Europe.
Paradoxically the wealth of the Indies impoverished Spain and enriched northern Europe.
"According to these thinkers, ""Royal expenditure must be regulated, the sale of office halted, the growth of the church checked."
"The tax system must be overhauled, special concessions be made to agricultural laborers, rivers be made navigable and dry lands irrigated."
"In this way alone could Castile's productivity increased, its commerce restored, and its humiliating dependence on foreigners, on the Dutch and the Genoese, be brought to an end."
"Shipping was through particular ports in Spain (Seville, subsequently Cadiz), Spanish America (Veracruz, Acapulco, Havana, Cartagena de Indias, and Callao/Lima) and the Philippines (Manila)."
Spanish settlers in the Indies in the very early period were few and Spain could supply sufficient goods to them.
"But as the Aztec and Inca empires were conquered in the early sixteenth century and then large deposits of silver found in both Mexico and Peru, the regions of those major empires, Spanish immigration increased and demand for goods rose far beyond Spain's ability to supply it."
"Since Spain had little capital to invest in the expanding trade and no significant commercial group, bankers and commercial houses in Genoa, Germany, The Netherlands, France, and England supplied both investment capital and goods in a supposedly closed system."
"Even in the sixteenth century, Spain recognized that the idealized closed system did not function in reality."
"Despite that the crown did not alter its restrictive structure or advocacy of fiscal prudence, despite the pleas of the arbitristas, the Indies trade remained nominally in the hands of Spain, but in fact enriched the other European countries."
Merchants in Seville conveyed consumer goods that were registered and taxed by the House of Trade.
were sent to the Indies were produced in other European countries.
"Other European commercial interests came to dominate supply, with Spanish merchant houses and their guilds (consulados) in Spain and the Indies acting as mere middlemen, reaping profits a slice of the profits."
"However, those profits did not promote Spanish economic development of a manufacturing sector, with its economy continuing to be based on agriculture."
"The wealth of the Indies led to prosperity in northern Europe, particularly The Netherlands and England, both Protestant."
"As Spain's power weakened in the seventeenth century, England, The Netherlands, and the French took advantage overseas by seizing islands in the Caribbean, which became bases for a burgeoning contraband trade in Spanish America."
"Crown officials who were supposed to suppress contraband trade were quite often in cahoots with the foreigners, since it was a source of personal enrichment."
"In Spain, the crown itself participated in collusion with foreign merchant houses, since they paid fines, ""meant to establish a compensation to the state for losses through fraud."""
it became for merchant houses a calculated risk for doing business; for the crown it gained income it would have lost otherwise.
Foreigner merchants were part of the supposed monopoly system of trade.
"The mines in Peru and Mexico were in the hands of a few elite mining entrepreneurs, with access to capital and a stomach for the risk mining entailed."
"They operated under a system of royal licensing, since the crown held the rights to subsoil wealth."
"Mining entrepreneurs assumed all the risk of the enterprise, while the crown gained a 20% slice of the profits, the royal fifth (""Quinto"")."
"Further adding to the crown's revenues was mining was that it crown held a monopoly on the supply of mercury, used for separating pure silver from silver ore in the patio process."
"The crown kept the price high, thereby depressing the volume of silver production."
Protecting its flow from Mexico and Peru as it transited to ports for shipment to Spain resulted early on in a convoy system (the flota) sailing twice a year.
"Its success can be judged by the fact that the silver fleet was captured only once, in 1628 by Dutch privateer Piet Hein."
That loss resulted in the bankruptcy of the Spanish crown and an extended period of economic depression in Spain.
One practice used by the Spanish to gather workers for the mines was called repartimiento.
This was a rotational forced labor system where indigenous pueblos were obligated to send laborers to work in Spanish mines and plantations for a set number of days out of the year.
"Repartimiento was not implemented to replace slave labor but instead existed alongside free wage labor, slavery, and indentured labor."
"It was, however, a way for the Spanish to procure cheap labor thus boosting the mining-driven economy."
It is important to note that the men who worked as repartimiento laborers were not always resistant to the practice.
"Some were drawn to the labor as a way to supplement the wages they earned cultivating fields so as to support their families and, of course, pay tributes."
"At first, a Spaniard could get repartimiento laborers to work for them with permission from a crown official, such as a viceroy,  only on the basis that this labor was absolutely necessary to provide the country with important resources."
This condition became laxer as the years went on and various enterprises had repartimiento laborers where they would work in dangerous conditions for long hours and low wages.
"During the Bourbon era, economic reforms sought to reverse the pattern that left Spain impoverished with no manufacturing sector and its colonies’ need for manufactured goods supplied by other nations."
"It attempted to restructure to establish as closed trading system, but it was hampered by the terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht."
The treaty ending the War of the Spanish Succession with a victory for the Bourbon French candidate for the throne had a provision for the British to legally sell by a license (Asiento de Negros) slaves to Spanish America.
The provision undermined the possibility of a revamped Spanish monopoly system.
The merchants also used the opportunity to engage in contraband trade of their manufactured goods.
Crown policy sought to make legal trade more appealing than contraband by instituting free commerce (comercio libre) in 1778 whereby Spanish American ports could trade with each other and they could trade with any port in Spain.
It was aimed at revamping a closed Spanish system and outflanking the increasingly powerful British.
"Silver production revived in the eighteenth century, with production far surpassing the earlier output."
"The crown reducing the taxes on mercury, meaning that a greater volume of pure silver could be refined."
"Silver mining absorbed most available capital in Mexico and Peru, and the crown emphasized the production of precious metals that was sent to Spain."
"There was some economic development in the Indies to supply food, but a diversified economy did not emerge."
The economic reforms of the Bourbon era both shaped and were themselves impacted by geopolitical developments in Europe.
The Bourbon Reforms arose out of the War of the Spanish Succession.
"In turn, the crown's attempt to tighten its control over its colonial markets in the Americas led to further conflict with other European powers who were vying for access to them."
"In the Americas, meanwhile, economic policies enacted under the Bourbons had different impacts in different regions."
"On one hand, silver production in New Spain greatly increased and led to economic growth."
"But much of the profits of the revitalized mining sector went to mining elites and state officials, while in rural areas of New Spain conditions for rural workers deteriorated, contributing to social unrest that would impact subsequent revolts."
"The settlement gave spoils to those who had backed a Habsburg for the Spanish monarchy, ceding European territory of the Spanish Netherlands, Naples, Milan, and Sardinia to Austria; Sicily and parts of Milan to the Duchy of Savoy, and Gibraltar and Menorca to the Kingdom of Great Britain."
"However, this recovery was not then translated into institutional improvement, rather the ""proximate solutions to permanent problems."""
This legacy of neglect was reflected in the early years of Bourbon rule in which the military was ill-advisedly pitched into battle in the War of the Quadruple Alliance (1718–1720).
"The poor performance of the Spanish military is well illustrated by the Battle of Cape Passaro, off the coast of Sicily, where a Spanish fleet was destroyed by the British."
"Following the war, the new Bourbon monarchy took a much more cautious approach to international relations, relying on a family alliance with Bourbon France, and continuing to follow a program of institutional renewal."
The crown program to enact reforms that promoted administrative control and efficiency in the metropole to the detriment of interests in the colonies undermined creole elites' loyalty to the crown.
"When French forces of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded the Iberian peninsula in 1808, Napoleon ousted the Spanish Bourbon monarchy, placing his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Spanish throne."
"There was a crisis of legitimacy of crown rule in Spanish America, leading to the Spanish American wars of independence (1808–1826)."
"It sought to increase revenues and to assert greater crown control, including over the Catholic Church."
Centralization of power was to be for the benefit of the crown and the metropole and for the defense of its empire against foreign incursions.
"From the viewpoint of Spain, the structures of colonial rule under the Habsburgs were no longer functioning to the benefit of Spain, with much wealth being retained in Spanish America and going to other European powers."
Cadiz became the one port for all Indies trading (see flota system).
"Individual sailings at regular intervals were slow to displace the traditional armed convoys, but by the 1760s there were regular ships plying the Atlantic from Cadiz to Havana and Puerto Rico, and at longer intervals to the Río de la Plata, where an additional viceroyalty was created in 1776."
The contraband trade that was the lifeblood of the Habsburg empire declined in proportion to registered shipping (a shipping registry having been established in 1735).
"Two upheavals registered unease within Spanish America and at the same time demonstrated the renewed resiliency of the reformed system: the Tupac Amaru uprising in Peru in 1780 and the rebellion of the comuneros of New Granada, both in part reactions to tighter, more efficient control."
Spain's victory in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1741) against a British expedition in the Caribbean port of Cartagena de Indias helped Spain secure its dominance of its possessions in America until the 19th century.
"But different regions fared differently under Bourbon rule, and even while New Spain was particularly prosperous, it was also marked by steep wealth inequality."
"Silver production boomed in New Spain during the 18th century, with output more than tripling between the start of the century and the 1750s."
"The economy and the population both grew, both centered around Mexico City."
"But while mine owners and the crown benefited from the flourishing silver economy, most of the population in the rural Bajío faced rising land prices, falling wages."
"Shipping grew rapidly from the mid-1740s until the Seven Years' War (1756–1763), reflecting in part the success of the Bourbons in bringing illicit trade under control."
"With the loosening of trade controls after the Seven Years' War, shipping trade within the empire once again began to expand, reaching an extraordinary rate of growth in the 1780s."
The end of Cadiz's monopoly of trade with America brought about a rebirth of Spanish manufactures.
Most notable was the rapidly growing textile industry of Catalonia which by the mid-1780s saw the first signs of industrialization.
"This saw the emergence of a small, politically active commercial class in Barcelona."
This isolated pocket of advanced economic development stood in stark contrast to the relative backwardness of most of the country.
"Most of the improvements were in and around some major coastal cities and the major islands such as Cuba, with its tobacco plantations, and a renewed growth of precious metals mining in America."
"On the other hand, most of rural Spain and its empire, where the great bulk of the population lived, lived in relatively backward conditions by 18th-century West European standards, reinforced old customs and isolation."
"Agricultural productivity remained low despite efforts to introduce new techniques to what was for the most part an uninterested, exploited peasant and laboring groups."
Governments were inconsistent in their policies.
"Though there were substantial improvements by the late 18th century, Spain was still an economic backwater."
"Under the mercantile trading arrangements it had difficulty in providing the goods being demanded by the strongly growing markets of its empire, and providing adequate outlets for the return trade."
"From an opposing point of view according to the ""backwardness"" mentioned above the naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt traveled extensively throughout the Spanish Americas, exploring and describing it for the first time from a modern scientific point of view between 1799 and 1804."
In his work Political essay on the kingdom of New Spain containing researches relative to the geography of Mexico he says that the Indians of New Spain lived in better conditions than any Russian or German peasant in Europe.
"Mexico City consumed 189 pounds of meat per person per year, in comparison to 163 pounds consumed by the inhabitants of Paris, the Mexicans also consumed almost the same amount of bread as any European city, with 363 kilograms of bread per person per year in comparison to the 377 kilograms consumed in Paris."
Caracas consumed seven times more meat per person than in Paris.
Von Humboldt also said that the average income in that period was four times the European income and also that the cities of New Spain were richer than many European cities.
"The relatively more peaceful century under the new monarchy had allowed it to rebuild and start the long process of modernizing its institutions and economy, and the demographic decline of the 17th century had been reversed."
It was a middle-ranking power with great power pretensions that could not be ignored.
But time was to be against it.
"The British, also occupied with France, were unable to capture Spanish convoys, and Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes."
"In Europe, Spain had been trying to divest Maria Theresa of Lombardy in northern Italy since 1741, but faced the opposition of Charles Emmanuel III of Sardinia, and warfare in northern Italy remained indecisive throughout the period up to 1746."
Spain was defeated during the invasion of Portugal and lost both Havana and Manila to British forces towards the end of the Seven Years' War (1756–63).
"However, it promptly recovered these losses and seized the British naval base in the Bahamas during the American Revolutionary War (1775–83)."
"During most of the 18th century, Spanish privateers were the scourge of the Antilles, with Dutch, British, French and Danish vessels as their prizes."
In 1783 and 1784 the Spanish navy bombarded Algiers to end piracy in the Mediterranean.
The second bombardment under Admiral Antonio Barceló damaged the city so severely that the Dey of Algiers negotiated a peace treaty.
"Admiral Luis de Córdova y Córdova captured two British convoys totaling seventy-nine ships, including a fleet of fifty-five merchantmen and frigates in the Action of 9 August 1780."
"The Spanish governor of Louisiana Bernardo de Gálvez launched several successful offensives against British Florida, capturing the entirety of West Florida from Britain."
"Spain and France were allies because of the Bourbon ""Family Pact"" carried out by both countries against Britain."
Gálvez also conquered the island New Providence in the Bahamas.
Jamaica was the last British stronghold of importance in the Caribbean.
"Gálvez attempted to organize a expedition to capture the island; however, the 1783 Peace of Paris was concluded and the invasion cancelled."
Under royal order from Charles III of Spain Gálvez continued the aid operations to supply the American rebels.
"The British blockaded the colonial ports of the Thirteen Colonies, and the route from Spanish-controlled New Orleans up to the Mississippi river was an effective alternative to supply the American rebels."
"Spain actively supported the thirteen colonies throughout the American Revolutionary War, beginning in 1776 by jointly funding Roderigue Hortalez and Company, a trading company that provided critical military supplies, throughout financing the final Siege of Yorktown in 1781 with a collection of gold and silver from Havana."
"Spanish aid was supplied to the colonies via four main routes: from French ports with the funding of Roderigue Hortalez and Company; through the port of New Orleans and up the Mississippi river; from warehouses in Havana; and (4)from the northwestern Spanish port of Bilbao, through the Gardoqui family trading company which supplied significant war materiel."
"Many Spanish expeditions explored large parts of this vast region, especially those close to Spanish settlements."
"During the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish soldiers, missionaries and adventurers also established pioneering communities, primarily in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo, and forts on the northeastern coast threatened by the French and Dutch."
"As Portuguese-Brazilian settlement expanded, following in the trail of the Bandeirantes exploits, these isolated Spanish groups were eventually integrated into Brazilian society."
"Only some Castilians who were displaced from the disputed areas of the Pampas of Rio Grande do Sul have left a significant influence on the formation of the gaucho, when they mixed with Indian groups, Portuguese and blacks who arrived in the region during the 18th century."
"The Spanish were barred by their laws from slaving of indigenous people, leaving them without a commercial interest deep in the interior of the Amazon basin."
The Laws of Burgos (1512) and the New Laws (1542) had been intended to protect the interests of indigenous people.
"The Portuguese-Brazilian slavers, the Bandeirantes, had the advantage of access from the mouth of the Amazon River, which was on the Portuguese side of the line of Tordesillas."
"By the 18th century, much of the Spanish territory was under de facto control of Portuguese-Brazil."
This reality was recognized with the legal transfer of sovereignty in 1750 of most of the Amazon basin and surrounding areas to Portugal in the Treaty of Madrid.
This settlement sowed the seeds of the Guaraní War in 1756.
The French had established an empire in northern North America and took some islands in the Caribbean.
The English established colonies on the eastern seaboard of North America and in northern North America and some Caribbean islands as well.
"In the eighteenth century, the Spanish crown realized that its territorial claims needed to be defended, particularly in the wake of its visible weakness during the Seven Years' War when Britain captured the important Spanish ports of Havana and Manila."
"Another important factor was that the Russian empire had expanded into North America from the mid-eighteenth century, with fur trading settlements in what is now Alaska and forts as far south as Fort Ross, California."
Great Britain was also expanding into areas that Spain claimed as its territory on the Pacific coast.
"Taking steps to shore up its fragile claims to California, Spain began planning California missions in 1769."
"Spain also began a series of voyages to the Pacific Northwest, where Russia and Great Britain were encroaching on claimed territory."
"The Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest, with Alessandro Malaspina and others sailing for Spain, came too late for Spain to assert its sovereignty in the Pacific Northwest."
"It was a dispute over claims in the Pacific Northwest, where neither nation had established permanent settlements."
"The crisis could have led to war, but it was resolved in the Nootka Convention, in which Spain and Great Britain agreed to not establish settlements and allowed free access to Nootka Sound on the west coast of what is now Vancouver Island."
"In 1806 Baron Nikolai Rezanov attempted to negotiate a treaty between the Russian-American Company and the Viceroyalty of New Spain, but his unexpected death in 1807 ended any treaty hopes."
"When the negotiations between the two nations were taking place, Spain's resources were stretched due to the Spanish American wars of independence."
Alessandro Malaspina's recommendation to turn the empire into a looser confederation to help improve governance and trade so as to quell the growing political tensions between the élites of the empire's periphery and center was suppressed by a monarchy afraid of losing control.
All was to be swept away by the tumult that was to overtake Europe at the turn of the 19th century with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars.
"The first major territory Spain was to lose in the 19th century was the vast Louisiana Territory, which had few European settlers."
It stretched north to Canada and was ceded by France in 1763 under the terms of the Treaty of Fontainebleau.
"The French, under Napoleon, took back possession as part of the Treaty of San Ildefonso in 1800 and sold it to the United States in the Louisiana Purchase of 1803."
"Napoleon's sale of the Louisiana Territory to the United States in 1803 caused border disputes between the United States and Spain that, with rebellions in West Florida (1810) and in the remainder of Louisiana at the mouth of the Mississippi, led to their eventual cession to the United States."
"The Royal Navy's decisive defeat of the main Spanish fleet, under French command, at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805 undermined Spain's ability to defend and hold on to its empire."
The British attempted to seize the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1806.
The Spanish viceroy retreated hastily to the hills when defeated by a small British force.
"However, the Criollos' militias and colonial army eventually repulsed the British."
The later intrusion of Napoleonic forces into Spain in 1808 cut off the effective connection with the overseas components of the empire.
A combination of internal and external factors led to the unforeseen and not inevitable loss of most of Spain's empire in Spanish America during the Spanish American wars of independence.
"Spain was France's ally, but it had tried to avoid being drawn directly into the ongoing conflict between Napoleon's France and Britain."
The remnants managed to return to the port of Cádiz.
"Napoleon sought greater control of the peninsula and in October 1807, Napoleon's troops transited northern Spain with 28,000 men in the invasion of Portugal, Britain's ally."
"Charles IV's bargain with Napoleon soured, and the huge French army was now occupying Spain itself."
"Charles's son and legitimate heir Ferdinand led the opposition to his father, since he and his supporters believed that the dynasty was crumbling at the top."
"On 23 March, a large French force entered the capital Madrid."
"Ferdinand naively accepted Napoleon's invitation to Bayonne, France; Ferdinand left a small junta to rule in what he thought would be a short absence."
"Instead, Napoleon put Ferdinand under house arrest."
"There was some support for Joseph I by Spanish reformers, but the opposition to him included elite Spanish interest groups as well as provincial elites and ordinary Spaniards."
"Spanish provinces asserted local political and military power against Madrid, and set up juntas."
"In Spain, political uncertainty lasted over a decade and turmoil for several decades, civil wars on succession disputes, a republic, and finally a liberal democracy."
"Resistance coalesced around juntas, emergency ad hoc governments."
"A Supreme Central Junta, ruling in the name of Ferdinand VII, was created on 25 September 1808 to coordinate efforts among the various juntas."
"Subsequently, a cortes or parliament was called, with representatives not only from Spain, but also Spanish America and the Philippines."
"A military coup in 1820 led by Rafael del Riego forced Ferdinand to accept the constitution again, which went back into force until Ferdinand raised troops in 1823, and re-asserted absolutist rule again."
The reinstatement of the constitution was a major factor in propelling New Spain's elites to support independence in 1821.
"Historian Brian Hamnett argues that had the Spanish monarchy and Spanish liberals been more flexible regarding the place of the overseas components, that the empire would not have collapsed."
Juntas emerged in Spanish America as Spain faced a political crisis due to the invasion and occupation by Napoleon Bonaparte and abdication of Ferdinand VII.
"Spanish Americans reacted in much the same way the Peninsular Spanish did, legitimizing their actions through traditional law, which held that sovereignty reverted to the people in the absence of a legitimate king."
"The majority of Spanish Americans continued to support the idea of maintaining a monarchy, but did not support retaining absolute monarchy under Ferdinand VII."
Spanish Americans wanted self-government.
The juntas in the Americas did not accept the governments of the Europeans – neither the government set up for Spain by the French nor the various Spanish Governments set up in response to the French invasion.
The liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 recognized indigenous peoples of the Americas as Spanish citizens.
But the acquisition of citizenship for any casta of Afro-American peoples of the Americas was through naturalization – excluding slaves.
The conservative Catholic hierarchy in New Spain supported Mexican independence largely because it found the liberal Spanish Constitution of 1812 abhorrent.
"Central America provinces became independent via Mexico's independence in 1821 and joined Mexico for a brief time (1822–23), but they chose their own path when Mexico became a republic in 1824."
"The Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz, Callao and Chiloé were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively."
It was the only time that a Spanish colonial possession would return to Spain after having gained independence.
"By 1862, Spain was contending with a limited insurgency and losing hundreds of soldiers to guerrillas and the devastation of yellow fever."
"A major uprising began in earnest in August 1863, motivated by the Spanish government's attempts to impose strict Catholicism and the Castilianization of most government and military positions."
"In September 1863, the Spanish garrison of Santiago abandoned the city and marched to Puerto Plata, harassed by Dominicans all the way."
"There they joined the garrison in the fort, leaving the city to be pillaged by the rebels."
"Eventually 600 Spanish sallied out, and after a severe fight, drove off the rebels with help from the cannon of the fort, but by then the city had been plundered and burnt almost out of existence."
"Thus by the end of 1864, it could be said the Spanish were winning."
"However, military victory was trumped by political defeat."
"The price of war in terms of money and lives had been huge, disease and the hardy guerrilla fighters of the island causing many casualties that Spain could ill afford, and in 1865, the Bourbon Queen Isabella II signed a decree annulling the annexation."
"The following year, Spain then sold its remaining Pacific Ocean possessions to Germany in the German–Spanish Treaty, retaining only its African territories."
"On 2 June 1899, the second expeditionary battalion Cazadores of Philippines, the last Spanish garrison in the Philippines, which had been besieged in Baler, Aurora at war's end, was pulled out, effectively ending around 300 years of Spanish hegemony in the archipelago."
"The following decades of Franco-Spanish collaboration resulted in the establishment and extension of Spanish protectorates south of the city, and Spanish influence obtained international recognition in the Berlin Conference of 1884: Spain administered Sidi Ifni and Western Sahara jointly."
"Spain claimed a protectorate over the coast of Guinea from Cape Bojador to Cap Blanc, too, and even try to press a claim over the Adrar and Tiris regions in Mauritania."
"The Rif Berbers rebelled, led by Abdelkrim, a former officer for the Spanish administration."
"A leading Spanish politician emphatically declared: ""We are at the most acute period of Spanish decadence""."
"After the disaster of Annual, the Alhucemas landing took place in September 1925 at the bay of Alhucemas."
The Spanish Army and Navy with a small collaboration of an allied French contingent put an end to the Rif War.
"Five years later, Francisco Franco, a general of the Army of Africa, rebelled against the republican government and started the Spanish Civil War (1936–39)."
During the Second World War the Vichy French presence in Tangier was overcome by that of Francoist Spain.
Spain lacked the wealth and the interest to develop an extensive economic infrastructure in its African colonies during the first half of the 20th century.
"However, through a paternalistic system, particularly on Bioko Island, Spain developed large cocoa plantations for which thousands of Nigerian workers were imported as laborers."
"Moroccan Sultan (later King) Mohammed V was interested in these territories and invaded Spanish Sahara in 1957, in the Ifni War, or in Spain, the Forgotten War (la Guerra Olvidada)."
"As the Spanish Equatorial Region, it was ruled by a governor general exercising military and civilian powers."
The name of the country was changed to Equatorial Guinea.
"Spanish control of Spanish Sahara endured until the 1975 Green March prompted a withdrawal, under Moroccan military pressure."
The future of this former Spanish colony remains uncertain.
The Canary Islands and Spanish cities in the African mainland are considered an equal part of Spain and the European Union but have a different tax system.
"Morocco still claims Ceuta, Melilla, and plazas de soberanía even though they are internationally recognized as administrative divisions of Spain."
"""The Spanish Empire left a huge linguistic, religious, political, cultural, and urban architectural legacy in the Western Hemisphere."
"With over 470 million native speakers today, Spanish is the second most spoken native language in the world, as result of the introduction of the language of Castile—Castilian, ""Castellano"" —from Iberia to Spanish America, later expanded by the governments of successor independent republics."
"An important cultural legacy of the Spanish empire overseas is Roman Catholicism, which remains the main religious faith in Spanish America and the Philippines."
Christian evangelization of indigenous peoples was a key responsibility of the crown and a justification for its imperial expansion.
"Although indigenous were considered neophytes and insufficiently mature in their faith for indigenous men to be ordained to the priesthood, the indigenous were part of the Catholic community of faith."
"Catholic orthodoxy enforced by the Inquisition, particularly targeting crypto-Jews and Protestants."
Not until after their independence in the nineteenth century did Spanish American republics allow religious toleration of other faiths.
Observances of Catholic holidays often have strong regional expressions and remain important in many parts of Spanish America.
"Observances include Day of the Dead, Carnival, Holy Week, Corpus Christi, Epiphany, and national saints' days, such as the Virgin of Guadalupe in Mexico."
"Politically, the colonial era has strongly influenced modern Spanish America."
The territorial divisions of the empire in Spanish America became the basis for boundaries between new republics after independence and for state divisions within countries.
It is often argued that the rise of caudillismo during and after Latin American independence movements created a legacy of authoritarianism in the region.
"There was no significant development of representative institutions during the colonial era, and the executive power was often made stronger than the legislative power during the national period as a result."
"Unfortunately, this has led to a popular misconception that the colonial legacy has caused the region to have an extremely oppressed proletariat."
Revolts and riots are often seen as evidence of this supposed extreme oppression.
"However, the culture of revolting against an unpopular government is not simply a confirmation of widespread authoritarianism."
"The colonial legacy did leave a political culture of revolt, but not always as a desperate last act."
The civil unrest of the region is seen by some as a form of political involvement.
"While the political context of the political revolutions in Spanish America is understood to be one in which liberal elites competed to form new national political structures, so too were those elites responding to mass lower-class political mobilization and participation."
"Hundreds of towns and cities in the Americas were founded during the Spanish rule, with the colonial centers and buildings of many of them now designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites attracting tourists."
"The tangible heritage includes universities, forts, cities, cathedrals, schools, hospitals, missions, government buildings and colonial residences, many of which still stand today."
"A number of present-day roads, canals, ports or bridges sit where Spanish engineers built them centuries ago."
The oldest universities in the Americas were founded by Spanish scholars and Catholic missionaries.
The Spanish Empire also left a vast cultural and linguistic legacy.
"In concert with the Portuguese, the Spanish Empire laid the foundations of a truly global trade by opening up the great trans-oceanic trade routes and the exploration of unknown territories and oceans for the western knowledge."
"Some cultivars that were introduced to America included grapes, wheat, barley, apples and citrous fruits; animals that were introduced to the New World were horses, donkeys, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and chickens."
"The Old World received from America such things as maize, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, tobacco, beans, squash, cacao (chocolate), vanilla, avocados, pineapples, chewing gum, rubber, peanuts, cashews, Brazil nuts, pecans, blueberries, strawberries, quinoa, amaranth, chia, agave and others."
"The result of these exchanges was to significantly improve the agricultural potential of not only in America, but also that of Europe and Asia."
The complex origins and contacts of different peoples resulted in cultural influences coming together in the varied forms so evident today in the former colonial areas.
"Television (TV), sometimes shortened to tele or telly, is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black and white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound."
"The term can refer to a television set, a television show, or the medium of television transmission."
"Television is a mass medium for advertising, entertainment, news, and sports."
"Television became available in crude experimental forms in the late 1920s, but it would still be several years before the new technology would be marketed to consumers."
"After World War II, an improved form of black-and-white TV broadcasting became popular in the United Kingdom and United States, and television sets became commonplace in homes, businesses, and institutions."
"The availability of multiple types of archival storage media such as Betamax and VHS tapes, high-capacity hard disk drives, DVDs, flash drives, high-definition Blu-ray Discs, and cloud digital video recorders has enabled viewers to watch pre-recorded material—such as movies—at home on their own time schedule."
"For many reasons, especially the convenience of remote retrieval, the storage of television and video programming now also occurs on the cloud (such as the video on demand service by Netflix)."
"Another development was the move from standard-definition television (SDTV) (576i, with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i) to high-definition television (HDTV), which provides a resolution that is substantially higher."
"Major manufacturers announced the discontinuation of CRT, DLP, plasma, and even fluorescent-backlit LCDs by the mid-2010s."
"In the near future, LEDs are expected to be gradually replaced by OLEDs."
"Alternatively television signals are distributed by coaxial cable or optical fiber, satellite systems and, since the 2000s via the Internet."
"A standard television set is composed of multiple internal electronic circuits, including a tuner for receiving and decoding broadcast signals."
A visual display device which lacks a tuner is correctly called a video monitor rather than a television.
"The first documented usage of the term dates back to 1900, when the Russian scientist Constantin Perskyi used it in a paper that he presented in French at the 1st International Congress of Electricity, which ran from 18 to 25 August 1900 during the International World Fair in Paris."
"The use of the term to mean ""a television set"" dates from 1941."
"The slang term ""the tube"" or the ""boob tube"" derives from the bulky cathode ray tube used on most TVs until the advent of flat-screen TVs."
"The ""small screen"", as both a compound adjective and noun, became specific references to television, while the ""big screen"" was used to identify productions made for theatrical release."
Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851.
Willoughby Smith discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873.
"As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884."
"This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image."
"Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk ""image rasterizer"" became exceedingly common."
Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on 24 August 1900.
"Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others."
"A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina."
"In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen."
A separate circuit regulated synchronization.
The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet.
"By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems."
"On 25 March 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London."
"Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a ventriloquist's dummy named ""Stooky Bill"", whose painted face had higher contrast, talking and moving."
"By 26 January 1926, he had demonstrated the transmission of an image of a face in motion by radio."
This is widely regarded as the world's first public television demonstration.
Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it.
A brightly illuminated subject was placed in front of a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses which swept images across a static photocell.
"The thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the USA, detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal."
"This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first."
The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image.
"As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced."
"Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face."
"In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany."
"In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Pathé established France's first television company, Télévision-Baird-Natan."
"In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby."
"In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television."
"Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240-lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly."
Their reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens.
"Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic, moving images."
"Along with the pictures, the sets received synchronized sound."
"The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey."
"Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality."
Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover.
A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects.
"The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds."
"Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: ""It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time."
It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.
"It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY."
"This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum in Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus."
The advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television.
"Mechanical television, despite its inferior image quality and generally smaller picture, would remain the primary television technology until the 1930s."
The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States.
"The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the ""Braun"" tube."
"It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube, with a phosphor-coated screen."
They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam.
"Both teams succeeded in transmitting ""very faint"" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate."
"Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel."
"The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or ""camera"" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by Kálmán Tihanyi beginning in 1924."
"His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (""photoelectrons"") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle."
"The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed ""Radioskop""."
The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October.
Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval.
Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day.
This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver.
This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration.
"That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (""Pem"") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required)."
"Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images."
Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage.
Zworykin was unable or unwilling to introduce evidence of a working model of his tube that was based on his 1923 patent application.
"However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique ""multipactor"" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931."
This small tube could amplify a signal reportedly to the 60th power or better and showed great promise in all fields of electronics.
"However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film."
"Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on 25 August 1934, and for ten days afterwards."
Mexican inventor Guillermo González Camarena also played an important role in early TV.
"On 2 November 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers."
"It alternated for a short time with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior."
"The EMI team, under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg, analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum."
"They solved this problem by developing, and patenting in 1934, two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron."
"The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater."
"It was used for outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch on a television set as the King laid a wreath at the Cenotaph."
"This was the first time that anyone had broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighboring buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA would do the same until the 1939 New York World's Fair."
This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron.
"The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerröhre für Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States."
"The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes."
"Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon."
"RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco."
"With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems."
"Following the invention of the first working transistor at Bell Labs, Sony founder Masaru Ibuka predicted in 1952 that the transition to electronic circuits made of transistors would lead to smaller and more portable television sets."
"The first fully transistorized, portable solid-state television set was the 8-inch Sony TV8-301, developed in 1959 and released in 1960."
This began the transformation of television viewership from a communal viewing experience to a solitary viewing experience.
"Although he gave no practical details, among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc, in 1880, for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning."
"Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver."
"But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it."
"Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on 4 February 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre."
"Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes, and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green, and blue images into one full color image."
The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird.
"This device was very ""deep"", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console."
"The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set."
"These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and, as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press."
Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate.
The phosphor was patterned so the electrons from the guns only fell on one side of the patterning or the other.
"Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained."
He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image.
Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color.
"However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system."
"The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface."
The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors.
The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube.
"One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum."
"In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems Committee approved an all-electronic system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth."
"The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and-white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited-resolution color display."
The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high-resolution color image.
The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement.
"The first color broadcast (the first episode of the live program The Marriage) occurred on 8 July 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white."
The first all-color prime-time season came just one year later.
"Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place."
It used a transistor-based UHF tuner.
These developments made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition.
"Color broadcasting in Europe was not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s, and broadcasts did not start until 1967."
"By this point many of the technical problems in the early sets had been worked out, and the spread of color sets in Europe was fairly rapid."
"Due to data compression, digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth."
It is an innovative service that represents the most significant evolution in television broadcast technology since color television emerged in the 1950s.
"Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high performance computers."
Motion-compensated DCT video compression significantly reduced the amount of bandwidth required for a digital TV signal.
"Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal."
This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed.
"First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images."
"Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements."
"The final standards adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution."
This compromise resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes—interlaced or progressive—would be best suited for the newer digital HDTV compatible display devices.
"Interlaced scanning, which had been specifically designed for older analogue CRT display technologies, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones."
"In fact, interlaced scanning can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth."
Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.
"Progressive scanning in effect doubles the amount of data generated for every full screen displayed in comparison to interlaced scanning by painting the screen in one pass in 1/60-second, instead of two passes in 1/30-second."
"The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not ""flicker"" on the new standard of display devices in the manner of interlaced scanning."
"It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa."
The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offered a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats.
Broadcasters also favored interlaced scanning because their vast archive of interlaced programming is not readily compatible with a progressive format.
"Initially the adoption rate was low, as the first digital tuner-equipped TVs were costly."
"But soon, as the price of digital-capable TVs dropped, more and more households were converting to digital televisions."
"Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional Broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access."
"Internet television refers to the receiving of television content over the Internet instead of by traditional systems—terrestrial, cable and satellite (although internet itself is received by these methods)."
IPTV is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters.
Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.
"Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs."
"Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015."
"Most modern 3D television sets use an active shutter 3D system or a polarized 3D system, and some are autostereoscopic without the need of glasses."
"Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on 10 August 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London."
Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electromechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques.
"Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads with the public."
"By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter."
"WRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on 13 January 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB."
"It was popularly known as ""WGY Television"" after its sister radio station."
"The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company."
The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers.
It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today.
"With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna."
"A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offered pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to cable television (CATV) for cord cutters."
All other countries around the world are also in the process of either shutting down analog terrestrial television or switching over to digital terrestrial television.
"This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television."
"It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large ""community antennas"" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes."
The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924.
The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB).
A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television program for viewing on a television set.
"Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner."
"Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television."
"In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital."
Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only.
"These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes."
"Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription."
The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million.
"The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to ground downlink stations."
"The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972."
"Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows, and other video content, over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters."
"Internet television should not be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV."
Smart television refers to the TV set which has a built-in operating system.
Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV.
"The ubiquitous television set became the display device for recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax and VHS, which enabled viewers to record TV shows and watch prerecorded movies."
These usually had a low resolution and screen size and never became popular with the public.
It has a means to accelerate and deflect the electron beam(s) onto the screen to create the images.
"long from front screen face to rear end), fairly heavy, and relatively fragile."
"As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick lead glass so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most X-ray emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product."
"In television sets and computer monitors, the entire front area of the tube is scanned repetitively and systematically in a fixed pattern called a raster."
"An image is produced by controlling the intensity of each of the three electron beams, one for each additive primary color (red, green, and blue) with a video signal as a reference."
"In all modern CRT monitors and televisions, the beams are bent by magnetic deflection, a varying magnetic field generated by coils and driven by electronic circuits around the neck of the tube, although electrostatic deflection is commonly used in oscilloscopes, a type of diagnostic instrument."
"While the DLP imaging device was invented by Texas Instruments, the first DLP based projector was introduced by Digital Projection Ltd in 1997."
Digital Projection and Texas Instruments were both awarded Emmy Awards in 1998 for invention of the DLP projector technology.
It is also used in about 85% of digital cinema projection.
"They are called ""plasma"" displays because the technology utilizes small cells containing electrically charged ionized gases, or what are in essence chambers more commonly known as fluorescent lamps."
"When manufacturing costs fell, this combination of features made LCDs practical for television receivers."
"LCDs come in two types: those using cold cathode fluorescent lamps, simply called LCDs and those using LED as backlight called as LEDs."
This layer of organic semiconductor is situated between two electrodes.
"Generally, at least one of these electrodes is transparent."
"It is also used for computer monitors, portable systems such as mobile phones, handheld game consoles and PDAs."
There are two main families of OLED: those based on small molecules and those employing polymers.
"Adding mobile ions to an OLED creates a light-emitting electrochemical cell or LEC, which has a slightly different mode of operation."
"Active-matrix OLEDs require a thin-film transistor backplane to switch each individual pixel on or off, but allow for higher resolution and larger display sizes."
"Thus, it can display deep black levels and can be thinner and lighter than a liquid crystal display (LCD)."
"In low ambient light conditions such as a dark room an OLED screen can achieve a higher contrast ratio than an LCD, whether the LCD uses cold cathode fluorescent lamps or LED backlight."
It is used in handheld television.
"The most common source of LDTV programming is the Internet, where mass distribution of higher-resolution video files could overwhelm computer servers and take too long to download."
"Many mobile phones and portable devices such as Apple's iPod Nano, or Sony's PlayStation Portable use LDTV video, as higher-resolution files would be excessive to the needs of their small screens (320×240 and 480×272 pixels respectively)."
Broadcast syndication: this is the terminology rather broadly used to describe secondary programming usages (beyond original run).
"It includes secondary runs in the country of first issue, but also international usage which may not be managed by the originating producer."
"This practice is increasing, however, generally on digital-only FTA channels or with subscriber-only, first-run material appearing on FTA."
"Also, affiliates rarely buy or produce non-network programming that is not centered on local programming."
The most expensive entertainment genres to produce are usually dramas and dramatic miniseries.
"However, other genres, such as historical Western genres, may also have high production costs."
"Popular culture entertainment genres include action-oriented shows such as police, crime, detective dramas, horror, or thriller shows."
"As well, there are also other variants of the drama genre, such as medical dramas and daytime soap operas."
"Science fiction shows can fall into either the drama or action category, depending on whether they emphasize philosophical questions or high adventure."
Comedy is a popular genre which includes situation comedy (sitcom) and animated shows for the adult demographic such as South Park.
"The least expensive forms of entertainment programming genres are game shows, talk shows, variety shows, and reality television."
Game shows feature contestants answering questions and solving puzzles to win prizes.
"Talk shows contain interviews with film, television, music and sports celebrities and public figures."
"Variety shows feature a range of musical performers and other entertainers, such as comedians and magicians, introduced by a host or Master of Ceremonies."
"There is some crossover between some talk shows and variety shows because leading talk shows often feature performances by bands, singers, comedians, and other performers in between the interview segments."
"A variant version of reality shows depicts celebrities doing mundane activities such as going about their everyday life (The Osbournes, Snoop Dogg's Father Hood) or doing regular jobs (The Simple Life)."
"Fictional television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are ""quality television"", include series such as Twin Peaks and The Sopranos."
"Kristin Thompson argues that some of these television series exhibit traits also found in art films, such as psychological realism, narrative complexity, and ambiguous plotlines."
"Nonfiction television programs that some television scholars and broadcasting advocacy groups argue are ""quality television"", include a range of serious, noncommercial, programming aimed at a niche audience, such as documentaries and public affairs shows."
"To protect revenues, subscription TV channels are usually encrypted to ensure that only subscribers receive the decryption codes to see the signal."
Unencrypted channels are known as free to air or FTA.
"Many TV networks and stations sell blocks of broadcast time to advertisers (""sponsors"") to fund their programming."
"Television advertisements (variously called a television commercial, commercial or ad in American English, and known in British English as an advert) is a span of television programming produced and paid for by an organization, which conveys a message, typically to market a product or service."
Advertising revenue provides a significant portion of the funding for most privately owned television networks.
"The vast majority of television advertisements today consist of brief advertising spots, ranging in length from a few seconds to several minutes (as well as program-length infomercials)."
"Advertisements of this sort have been used to promote a wide variety of goods, services and ideas since the beginning of television."
The effects of television advertising upon the viewing public (and the effects of mass media in general) have been the subject of philosophical discourse by such luminaries as Marshall McLuhan.
"The viewership of television programming, as measured by companies such as Nielsen Media Research, is often used as a metric for television advertisement placement, and consequently, for the rates charged to advertisers to air within a given network, television program, or time of day (called a ""daypart"")."
"In many countries, including the United States, television campaign advertisements are considered indispensable for a political campaign."
"In other countries, such as France, political advertising on television is heavily restricted, while some countries, such as Norway, completely ban political advertisements."
"The first official, paid television advertisement was broadcast in the United States on 1 July 1941 over New York station WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies."
"The Bulova logo, with the phrase ""Bulova Watch Time"", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute."
"The first TV ad broadcast in Asia was on Nippon Television in Tokyo on 28 August 1953, advertising Seikosha (now Seiko), which also displayed a clock with the current time."
"This, in turn, gave great creative license to the advertisers over the content of the show."
US advertising rates are determined primarily by Nielsen ratings.
The time of the day and popularity of the channel determine how much a TV commercial can cost.
"Conversely, lesser-viewed time slots, such as early mornings and weekday afternoons, are often sold in bulk to producers of infomercials at far lower rates."
"In recent years, the paid program or infomercial has become common, usually in lengths of 30 minutes or one hour."
"For example, a character could be drinking a certain kind of soda, going to a particular chain restaurant, or driving a certain make of car."
"Sometimes, a specific brand or trade mark, or music from a certain artist or group, is used."
Its restrictions have applied since the early days of commercially funded TV.
"Despite this, an early TV mogul, Roy Thomson, likened the broadcasting licence as being a ""licence to print money""."
"Restrictions mean that the big three national commercial TV channels: ITV, Channel 4, and Channel 5 can show an average of only seven minutes of advertising per hour (eight minutes in the peak period)."
Other broadcasters must average no more than nine minutes (twelve in the peak).
This means that many imported TV shows from the US have unnatural pauses where the UK company does not utilize the narrative breaks intended for more frequent US advertising.
"Advertisements must not be inserted in the course of certain specific proscribed types of programs which last less than half an hour in scheduled duration; this list includes any news or current affairs programs, documentaries, and programs for children; additionally, advertisements may not be carried in a program designed and broadcast for reception in schools or in any religious broadcasting service or other devotional program or during a formal Royal ceremony or occasion."
There also must be clear demarcations in time between the programs and the advertisements.
"The BBC, being strictly non-commercial, is not allowed to show advertisements on television in the UK, although it has many advertising-funded channels abroad."
"The majority of its budget comes from television license fees (see below) and broadcast syndication, the sale of content to other broadcasters."
Most subscription services are also funded by advertising.
"This television license fee is set by the government, but the BBC is not answerable to or controlled by the government."
"When the same sporting event has been presented on both BBC and commercial channels, the BBC always attracts the lion's share of the audience, indicating that viewers prefer to watch TV uninterrupted by advertising."
"Other than internal promotional material, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) carries no advertising; it is banned under the ABC Act 1983."
The ABC receives its funding from the Australian government every three years.
"The funds provide for the ABC's television, radio, online, and international outputs."
The ABC also receives funds from its many ABC shops across Australia.
"Although funded by the Australian government, the editorial independence of the ABC is ensured through law."
The broadcast law that governs NHK's funding stipulates that any television equipped to receive NHK is required to pay.
"The fee is standardized, with discounts for office workers and students who commute, as well a general discount for residents of Okinawa prefecture."
"There are many aspects of television that can be addressed, including negative issues such as media violence."
Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation.
Several studies have found that educational television has many advantages.
"The article ""The Good Things about Television"" argues that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely."
"Newer flat-screen televisions are ""top-heavy and have narrow bases"", which means that a small child can easily pull one over."
This effect was stronger for boys from more educated families.
"Related occupational health concerns exist, as well, for disassemblers removing copper wiring and other materials from CRTs."
"A theory is a contemplative and rational type of abstract or generalizing thinking about a phenomenon, or the results of such thinking."
"The process of contemplative and rational thinking often is associated with such processes like observational study, research."
Theories may either be scientific or other than scientific (or scientific to less extent).
"Depending on the context, the results might, for example, include generalized explanations of how nature works."
"The word has its roots in ancient Greek, but in modern use it has taken on several related meanings."
"In modern science, the term ""theory"" refers to scientific theories, a well-confirmed type of explanation of nature, made in a way consistent with scientific method, and fulfilling the criteria required by modern science."
"Such theories are described in such a way that scientific tests should be able to provide empirical support for it, or empirical contradiction (""falsify"") of it."
"Scientific theories are the most reliable, rigorous, and comprehensive form of scientific knowledge, in contrast to more common uses of the word ""theory"" that imply that something is unproven or speculative (which in formal terms is better characterized by the word hypothesis)."
"Scientific theories are distinguished from hypotheses, which are individual empirically testable conjectures, and from scientific laws, which are descriptive accounts of the way nature behaves under certain conditions."
"Theories guide the enterprise of finding facts rather than of reaching goals, and are neutral concerning alternatives among values."
"A theory can be a body of knowledge, which may or may not be associated with particular explanatory models."
"In those instances, semantically, it is being substituted for another concept, a hypothesis."
"A ""classical example"" of the distinction between ""theoretical"" and ""practical"" uses the discipline of medicine: medical theory involves trying to understand the causes and nature of health and sickness, while the practical side of medicine is trying to make people healthy."
"These two things are related but can be independent, because it is possible to research health and sickness without curing specific patients, and it is possible to cure a patient without knowing how the cure worked."
"As an everyday word, theoria, θεωρία, meant ""looking at, viewing, beholding"", but in more technical contexts it came to refer to contemplative or speculative understandings of natural things, such as those of natural philosophers, as opposed to more practical ways of knowing things, like that of skilled orators or artisans."
English-speakers have used the word theory since at least the late 16th century.
"Modern uses of the word theory derive from the original definition, but have taken on new shades of meaning, still based on the idea of a theory as a thoughtful and rational explanation of the general nature of things."
"In the book From Religion to Philosophy, Francis Cornford suggests that the Orphics used the word theoria to mean ""passionate sympathetic contemplation""."
"Pythagoras changed the word to mean ""the passionless contemplation of rational, unchanging truth"" of mathematical knowledge, because he considered this intellectual pursuit the way to reach the highest plane of existence."
Pythagoras emphasized subduing emotions and bodily desires to help the intellect function at the higher plane of theory.
"For Aristotle, both practice and theory involve thinking, but the aims are different."
"Theoretical contemplation considers things humans do not move or change, such as nature, so it has no human aim apart from itself and the knowledge it helps create."
"On the other hand, praxis involves thinking, but always with an aim to desired actions, whereby humans cause change or movement themselves for their own ends."
Any human movement that involves no conscious choice and thinking could not be an example of praxis or doing.
"There are theories in many and varied fields of study, including the arts and sciences."
"Theories in various fields of study are expressed in natural language, but are always constructed in such a way that their general form is identical to a theory as it is expressed in the formal language of mathematical logic."
"Theories may be expressed mathematically, symbolically, or in common language, but are generally expected to follow principles of rational thought or logic."
Theory is constructed of a set of sentences that are entirely true statements about the subject under consideration.
"However, the truth of any one of these statements is always relative to the whole theory."
"Therefore, the same statement may be true with respect to one theory, and not true with respect to another."
"A pair of such theories is called indistinguishable or observationally equivalent, and the choice between them reduces to convenience or philosophical preference."
"The form of theories is studied formally in mathematical logic, especially in model theory."
"When theories are studied in mathematics, they are usually expressed in some formal language and their statements are closed under application of certain procedures called rules of inference."
"A special case of this, an axiomatic theory, consists of axioms (or axiom schemata) and rules of inference."
A theorem is a statement that can be derived from those axioms by application of these rules of inference.
Theories used in applications are abstractions of observed phenomena and the resulting theorems provide solutions to real-world problems.
"Obvious examples include arithmetic (abstracting concepts of number), geometry (concepts of space), and probability (concepts of randomness and likelihood)."
"As a result, some domains of knowledge cannot be formalized, accurately and completely, as mathematical theories."
"(Here, formalizing accurately and completely means that all true propositions—and only true propositions—are derivable within the mathematical system.)"
"This limitation, however, in no way precludes the construction of mathematical theories that formalize large bodies of scientific knowledge."
Underdetermination is an epistemological issue about the relation of evidence to conclusions.
"A theory that lacks supporting evidence is generally, more properly, referred to as a hypothesis."
This is called an intertheoretic reduction because the terms of the old theory can be reduced to the terms of the new one.
"For instance, our historical understanding about sound, ""light"" and heat have been reduced to wave compressions and rarefactions, electromagnetic waves, and molecular kinetic energy, respectively."
"These terms, which are identified with each other, are called intertheoretic identities."
"When an old and new theory are parallel in this way, we can conclude that the new one describes the same reality, only more completely."
"When a new theory uses new terms that do not reduce to terms of an older theory, but rather replace them because they misrepresent reality, it is called an intertheoretic elimination."
"For instance, the obsolete scientific theory that put forward an understanding of heat transfer in terms of the movement of caloric fluid was eliminated when a theory of heat as energy replaced it."
"Also, the theory that phlogiston is a substance released from burning and rusting material was eliminated with the new understanding of the reactivity of oxygen."
"A theorem is derived deductively from axioms (basic assumptions) according to a formal system of rules, sometimes as an end in itself and sometimes as a first step toward being tested or applied in a concrete situation; theorems are said to be true in the sense that the conclusions of a theorem are logical consequences of the axioms."
"Theories are abstract and conceptual, and are supported or challenged by observations in the world."
"They are 'rigorously tentative', meaning that they are proposed as true and expected to satisfy careful examination to account for the possibility of faulty inference or incorrect observation."
"Sometimes theories are incorrect, meaning that an explicit set of observations contradicts some fundamental objection or application of the theory, but more often theories are corrected to conform to new observations, by restricting the class of phenomena the theory applies to or changing the assertions made."
An example of the former is the restriction of classical mechanics to phenomena involving macroscopic length scales and particle speeds much lower than the speed of light.
"Theories must also meet further requirements, such as the ability to make falsifiable predictions with consistent accuracy across a broad area of scientific inquiry, and production of strong evidence in favor of the theory from multiple independent sources (consilience)."
"The strength of a scientific theory is related to the diversity of phenomena it can explain, which is measured by its ability to make falsifiable predictions with respect to those phenomena."
"Theories are improved (or replaced by better theories) as more evidence is gathered, so that accuracy in prediction improves over time; this increased accuracy corresponds to an increase in scientific knowledge."
"Scientists use theories as a foundation to gain further scientific knowledge, as well as to accomplish goals such as inventing technology or curing diseases."
It refers to a comprehensive explanation of some aspect of nature that is supported by a vast body of evidence.
Many scientific theories are so well established that no new evidence is likely to alter them substantially.
"Such fact-supported theories are not ""guesses"" but reliable accounts of the real world."
"The theory of biological evolution is more than ""just a theory."""
It is as factual an explanation of the universe as the atomic theory of matter or the germ theory of disease.
Our understanding of gravity is still a work in progress.
"But the phenomenon of gravity, like evolution, is an accepted fact."
"The term theory is not appropriate for describing scientific models or untested, but intricate hypotheses."
"In a deductive theory, any sentence which is a logical consequence of one or more of the axioms is also a sentence of that theory."
This is called the received view of theories.
"In the semantic view of theories,  which has largely replaced the received view, theories are viewed as scientific models."
"A model is a logical framework intended to represent reality (a ""model of reality""), similar to the way that a map is a graphical model that represents the territory of a city or country."
"In this approach, theories are a specific category of models that fulfill the necessary criteria."
"One good example is classical electromagnetism, which encompasses results derived from gauge symmetry (sometimes called gauge invariance) in a form of a few equations called Maxwell's equations."
"The specific mathematical aspects of classical electromagnetic theory are termed ""laws of electromagnetism"", reflecting the level of consistent and reproducible evidence that supports them."
"Within electromagnetic theory generally, there are numerous hypotheses about how electromagnetism applies to specific situations."
"Many of these hypotheses are already considered adequately tested, with new ones always in the making and perhaps untested."
"For example, certain tests may be infeasible or technically difficult."
"As a result, theories may make predictions that have not yet been confirmed or proven incorrect; in this case, the predicted results may be described informally using the term ""theoretical."""
"These predictions can be tested at a later time, and if they are incorrect, this may lead to revision, invalidation, or rejection of the theory."
"In the same sense, but more specifically, the word theory is an extensive, structured collection of theorems, organized so that the proof of each theorem only requires the theorems and axioms that preceded it (no circular proofs), occurs as early as feasible in sequence (no postponed proofs), and the whole is as succinct as possible (no redundant proofs)."
"Ideally, the sequence in which the theorems are presented is as easy to understand as possible, although illuminating a branch of mathematics is the purpose of textbooks, rather than the mathematical theory they might be written to cover."
"The latter are those whose subject matter consists not of empirical data, but rather of ideas."
At least some of the elementary theorems of a philosophical theory are statements whose truth cannot necessarily be scientifically tested through empirical observation.
"A field of study is sometimes named a ""theory"" because its basis is some initial set of assumptions describing the field's approach to the subject."
"These assumptions are the elementary theorems of the particular theory, and can be thought of as the axioms of that field."
"Some commonly known examples include set theory and number theory; however literary theory, critical theory, and music theory are also of the same form."
A metatheory is a theory whose subject matter is some other theory or set of theories.
"In other words, it is a theory about theories."
Statements made in the metatheory about the theory are called metatheorems.
"Often the term ""political theory"" refers to a general view, or specific ethic, political belief or attitude, about politics."
"Contemporary philosophy of law addresses problems internal to law and legal systems, and problems of law as a particular social institution."
A tradition is a belief or behavior (folk custom) passed down within a group or society with symbolic meaning or special significance with origins in the past.
"A component of folklore, common examples include holidays or impractical but socially meaningful clothes (like lawyers' wigs or military officers' spurs), but the idea has also been applied to social norms such as greetings."
"While it is commonly assumed that traditions have an ancient history, many traditions have been invented on purpose, whether that be political or cultural, over short periods of time."
Various academic disciplines also use the word in a variety of ways.
"The phrase ""according to tradition"", or ""by tradition"", usually means that whatever information follows is known only by oral tradition, but is not supported (and perhaps may be refuted) by physical documentation, by a physical artifact, or other quality evidence."
Tradition is used to indicate the quality of a piece of information being discussed.
"For example, ""According to tradition, Homer was born on Chios, but many other locales have historically claimed him as theirs."""
This tradition may never be proven or disproven.
"In another example, ""King Arthur, by tradition a true British king, has inspired many well loved stories."""
Whether they are documented fact or not does not decrease their value as cultural history and literature.
"Traditions are a subject of study in several academic fields, especially in social sciences such as folklore studies, anthropology, archaeology, and biology."
"The concept of tradition, as the notion of holding on to a previous time, is also found in political and philosophical discourse."
"For example, it is the basis of the political concept of traditionalism, and also strands of many world religions including traditional Catholicism."
"In artistic contexts, tradition is used to decide the correct display of an art form."
"For example, in the performance of traditional genres (such as traditional dance), adherence to guidelines dictating how an art form should be composed are given greater importance than the performer's own preferences."
"A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups."
"In response to this, tradition-preservation attempts have now been started in many countries around the world, focusing on aspects such as traditional languages."
"Tradition is usually contrasted with the goal of modernity and should be differentiated from customs, conventions, laws, norms, routines, rules and similar concepts."
"Originally, traditions were passed orally, without the need for a writing system."
Tools to aid this process include poetic devices such as rhyme and alliteration.
"The stories thus preserved are also referred to as tradition, or as part of an oral tradition."
"Even such traditions, however, are presumed to have originated (been ""invented"" by humans) at some point."
"Traditions are often presumed to be ancient, unalterable, and deeply important, though they may sometimes be much less ""natural"" than is presumed."
"It is presumed that at least two transmissions over three generations are required for a practice, belief or object to be seen as traditional."
"Some traditions were deliberately invented for one reason or another, often to highlight or enhance the importance of a certain institution."
"Traditions may also be adapted to suit the needs of the day, and the changes can become accepted as a part of the ancient tradition."
"Tradition changes slowly, with changes from one generation to the next being seen as significant."
"beliefs or customs instituted and maintained by societies and governments, such as national anthems and national holidays, such as Federal holidays in the United States."
"beliefs or customs maintained by religious denominations and Church bodies that share history, customs, culture, and, to some extent, body of teachings."
"Rituals of social interaction can be traditional, with phrases and gestures such as saying ""thank you"", sending birth announcements, greeting cards, etc."
"Tradition can also refer to larger concepts practiced by groups (family traditions at Christmas), organizations (company's picnic) or societies, such as the practice of national and public holidays."
Some of the oldest traditions include monotheism (three millennia) and citizenship (two millennia).
"In such constructions tradition refers to specific values and materials particular to the discussed context, passed through generations."
"Similarly, most of the traditions associated with monarchy of the United Kingdom, seen as rooted deep in history, actually date to 19th century."
Other examples include the invention of tradition in Africa and other colonial holdings by the occupying forces.
"Requiring legitimacy, the colonial power would often invent a ""tradition"" which they could use to legitimize their own position."
"For example, a certain succession to a chiefdom might be recognized by a colonial power as traditional in order to favour their own candidates for the job."
"Often these inventions were based in some form of tradition, but were exaggerated, distorted, or biased toward a particular interpretation."
"Invented traditions are a central component of modern national cultures, providing a commonality of experience and promoting the unified national identity espoused by nationalism."
"Common examples include public holidays (particularly those unique to a particular nation), the singing of national anthems, and traditional national cuisine (see national dish)."
Expatriate and immigrant communities may continue to practice the national traditions of their home nation.
"For Popper, each scientist who embarks on a certain research trend inherits the tradition of the scientists before them as he or she inherits their studies and any conclusions that superseded it."
"Unlike myth, which is a means of explaining the natural world through means other than logical criticism, scientific tradition was inherited from Socrates, who proposed critical discussion, according to Popper."
"It is also used in varying contexts in other fields, such as history, psychology and sociology."
Social scientists and others have worked to refine the commonsense concept of tradition to make it into a useful concept for scholarly analysis.
"Since then, a wide variety of social scientists have criticized traditional ideas about tradition; meanwhile, ""tradition"" has come into usage in biology as applied to nonhuman animals."
"Tradition as a concept variously defined in different disciplines should not be confused with various traditions (perspectives, approaches) in those disciplines."
"There is however no ""theory of tradition"", as for most anthropologists the need to discuss what tradition is seems unnecessary, as defining tradition is both unnecessary (everyone can be expected to know what it is) and unimportant (as small differences in definition would be just technical)."
There are however dissenting views; scholars such as Pascal Boyer argue that defining tradition and developing theories about it are important to the discipline.
The term is especially common in the study of American archaeology.
"Groups of orangutans and chimpanzees, in particular, may display large numbers of behavioral traditions, and in chimpanzees, transfer of traditional behavior from one group to another (not just within a group) has been observed."
"Such behavioral traditions may have evolutionary significance, allowing adaptation at a faster rate than genetic change."
Tradition in music suggests a historical context with which one can perceive distinguishable patterns.
"Along with a sense of history, traditions have a fluidity that cause them to evolve and adapt over time."
While both musicology and ethnomusicology are defined by being 'the scholarly study of music'  they differ in their methodology and subject of research.
"'Tradition, or traditions, can be presented as a context in which to study the work of a specific composer or as a part of a wide-ranging historical perspective.'"
This approach was most notably portrayed in Max Weber's concepts of traditional authority and modern rational-legal authority.
"It is also related to the works of Max Weber (see theories of rationality), and were popularized and redefined in 1992 by Raymond Boudon in his book Action."
"In this context tradition refers to the mode of thinking and action justified as ""it has always been that way""."
"This line of reasoning forms the basis of the logical flaw of the appeal to tradition (or argumentum ad antiquitatem), which takes the form ""this is right because we've always done it this way."""
"In most cases such an appeal can be refuted on the grounds that the ""tradition"" being advocated may no longer be desirable, or, indeed, may never have been despite its previous popularity."
"Twentieth century philosophy is often divided between an 'analytic' tradition, dominant in Anglophone and Scandinavian countries, and a 'continental' tradition, dominant in German and Romance speaking Europe."
"Increasingly central to continental philosophy is the project of deconstructing what its proponents, following Martin Heidegger, call 'the tradition', which began with Plato and Aristotle."
"In contrast, some continental philosophers - most notably, Hans-Georg Gadamer - have attempted to rehabilitate the tradition of Aristotelianism."
This move has been replicated within analytic philosophy by Alasdair MacIntyre.
"However, MacIntyre has himself deconstructed the idea of 'the tradition', instead posing Aristotelianism as one philosophical tradition in rivalry with others."
"In the United States in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, the concept of tradition has been used to argue for the centrality and legitimacy of conservative religious values."
"Similarly, strands of orthodox theological thought from a number of world religions openly identify themselves as wanting a return to tradition."
"For example, the term ""traditionalist Catholic"" refers to those, such as Archbishop Lefebvre, who want the worship and practices of the Church to be as they were before the Second Vatican Council of 1962–65."
"More generally, tradition has been used as a way of determining the political spectrum, with right-wing parties having a stronger affinity to the ways of the past than left-wing ones."
"Here, the concept of adherence tradition is embodied by the political philosophy of traditionalist conservatism (or simply traditionalism), which emphasizes the need for the principles of natural law and transcendent moral order, hierarchy and organic unity, agrarianism, classicism and high culture, and the intersecting spheres of loyalty."
"Traditionalists would therefore reject the notions of individualism, liberalism, modernity, and social progress, but promote cultural and educational renewal, and revive interest in the Church, the family, the State and local community."
"Defining and enacting traditions in some cases can be a means of building unity between subgroups in a diverse society; in other cases, tradition is a means of othering and keeping groups distinct from one another."
It is often the unchanging form of certain arts that leads to their perception as traditional.
"For artistic endeavors, tradition has been used as a contrast to creativity, with traditional and folk art associated with unoriginal imitation or repetition, in contrast to fine art, which is valued for being original and unique."
"More recent philosophy of art, however, considers interaction with tradition as integral to the development of new artistic expression."
"This dichotomy is generally associated with a linear model of social change, in which societies progress from being traditional to being modern."
"Tradition-oriented societies have been characterized as valuing filial piety, harmony and group welfare, stability, and interdependence, while a society exhibiting modernity would value ""individualism (with free will and choice), mobility, and progress."""
"Another author discussing tradition in relationship to modernity, Anthony Giddens, sees tradition as something bound to ritual, where ritual guarantees the continuation of tradition."
"Whereas tradition is supposed to be invariable, they are seen as more flexible and subject to innovation and change."
"Whereas justification for tradition is ideological, the justification for other similar concepts is more practical or technical."
"Over time, customs, routines, conventions, rules and such can evolve into traditions, but that usually requires that they stop having (primarily) a practical purpose."
"For example, wigs worn by lawyers were at first common and fashionable; spurs worn by military officials were at first practical but now are both impractical and traditional."
"In addition to the fundamental protection of cultural property, there is also cooperation between the United Nations, UNESCO and Blue Shield International in the protection or recording of traditions and customs."
The protection of culture and traditions is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally.
"It is also about preserving the cultural heritage of mankind, especially in the event of war and armed conflict."
"According to Karl von Habsburg, President Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets, traditions and languages is also part of psychological warfare."
The target of the attack is the opponent's identity.
"A number of factors can exacerbate the loss of tradition, including industrialization, globalization, and the assimilation or marginalization of specific cultural groups."
Customary celebrations and lifestyles are among the traditions that are sought to be preserved.
"Likewise, the concept of tradition has been used to defend the preservation and reintroduction of minority languages such as Cornish under the auspices of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages."
"Specifically, the charter holds that these languages ""contribute to the maintenance and development of Europe's cultural wealth and traditions""."
"Similarly, UNESCO includes both ""oral tradition"" and ""traditional manifestations"" in its definition of a country's cultural properties and heritage."
"The field can be divided into infrastructure, vehicles and operations."
"Transport enables trade between people, which is essential for the development of civilizations."
"Transport infrastructure consists of the fixed installations, including roads, railways, airways, waterways, canals and pipelines and terminals such as airports, railway stations, bus stations, warehouses, trucking terminals, refueling depots (including fueling docks and fuel stations) and seaports."
Terminals may be used both for interchange of passengers and cargo and for maintenance.
"Vehicles traveling on these networks may include automobiles, bicycles, buses, trains, trucks, helicopters, watercraft, spacecraft and aircraft."
"The transport of a person or of cargo may involve one mode or several of the modes, with the latter case being called inter-modal or multi-modal transport."
"Each mode has its own advantages and disadvantages, and will be chosen on the basis of cost, capability, and route."
"Governments deal with the way the vehicles are operated, and the procedures set for this purpose, including financing, legalities, and policies."
"In the transport industry, operations and ownership of infrastructure can be either public or private, depending on the country and mode."
"Passenger transport may be public, where operators provide scheduled services, or private."
"Freight transport has become focused on containerization, although bulk transport is used for large volumes of durable items."
"Transport plays an important part in economic growth and globalization, but most types cause air pollution and use large amounts of land."
"While it is heavily subsidized by governments, good planning of transport is essential to make traffic flow and restrain urban sprawl."
Modern technology has allowed machines to enhance human power.
"Human-powered transport remains popular for reasons of cost-saving, leisure, physical exercise, and environmentalism; it is sometimes the only type available, especially in underdeveloped or inaccessible regions."
"Although humans are able to walk without infrastructure, the transport can be enhanced through the use of roads, especially when using the human power with vehicles, such as bicycles and inline skates."
"Human-powered vehicles have also been developed for difficult environments, such as snow and water, by watercraft rowing and skiing; even the air can be entered with human-powered aircraft."
"Humans may ride some of the animals directly, use them as pack animals for carrying goods, or harness them, alone or in teams, to pull sleds or wheeled vehicles."
"The term is used to distinguish this from rotary-wing aircraft, where the movement of the lift surfaces relative to the air generates lift."
A gyroplane is both fixed-wing and rotary wing.
Fixed-wing aircraft range from small trainers and recreational aircraft to large airliners and military cargo aircraft.
Two things necessary for aircraft are air flow over the wings for lift and an area for landing.
"The majority of aircraft also need an airport with the infrastructure to receive maintenance, restocking, refueling and for the loading and unloading of crew, cargo, and passengers."
"While the vast majority of aircraft land and take off on land, some are capable of take-off and landing on ice, snow, and calm water."
"The aircraft is the second fastest method of transport, after the rocket."
"Aviation is able to quickly transport people and limited amounts of cargo over longer distances, but incurs high costs and energy use; for short distances or in inaccessible places, helicopters can be used."
Land transport plays a vital role in linking communities to each other.
Land transport is a key factor in urban planning.
"It consists of two kinds, rail and road."
"The rails are anchored perpendicular to ties (or sleepers) of timber, concrete or steel, to maintain a consistent distance apart, or gauge."
The rails and perpendicular beams are placed on a foundation made of concrete or compressed earth and gravel in a bed of ballast.
Alternative methods include monorail and maglev.
A train consists of one or more connected vehicles that operate on the rails.
"Propulsion is commonly provided by a locomotive, that hauls a series of unpowered cars, that can carry passengers or freight."
"The locomotive can be powered by steam, diesel or by electricity supplied by trackside systems."
"Alternatively, some or all the cars can be powered, known as a multiple unit."
"Also, a train can be powered by horses, cables, gravity, pneumatics and gas turbines."
"Railed vehicles move with much less friction than rubber tires on paved roads, making trains more energy efficient, though not as efficient as ships."
"Intercity trains are long-haul services connecting cities; modern high-speed rail is capable of speeds up to 350 km/h (220 mph), but this requires specially built track."
"Regional and commuter trains feed cities from suburbs and surrounding areas, while intra-urban transport is performed by high-capacity tramways and rapid transits, often making up the backbone of a city's public transport."
"Freight trains traditionally used box cars, requiring manual loading and unloading of the cargo."
"Since the 1960s, container trains have become the dominant solution for general freight, while large quantities of bulk are transported by dedicated trains."
"Roads are typically smoothed, paved, or otherwise prepared to allow easy travel; though they need not be, and historically many roads were simply recognizable routes without any formal construction or maintenance."
"Other users of roads include buses, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles and pedestrians."
Road transport offers complete freedom to road users to transfer the vehicle from one lane to the other and from one road to another according to the need and convenience.
"This flexibility of changes in location, direction, speed, and timings of travel is not available to other modes of transport."
It is possible to provide door-to-door service only by road transport.
"Automobiles provide high flexibility with low capacity, but require high energy and area use, and are the main source of harmful noise and air pollution in cities; buses allow for more efficient travel at the cost of reduced flexibility."
Road transport by truck is often the initial and final stage of freight transport.
"The need for buoyancy is common to watercraft, making the hull a dominant aspect of its construction, maintenance and appearance."
The steam was produced in a boiler using wood or coal and fed through a steam external combustion engine.
Now most ships have an internal combustion engine using a slightly refined type of petroleum called bunker fuel.
"Some ships, such as submarines, use nuclear power to produce the steam."
"Recreational or educational craft still use wind power, while some smaller craft use internal combustion engines to drive one or more propellers, or in the case of jet boats, an inboard water jet."
"In shallow draft areas, hovercraft are propelled by large pusher-prop fans."
"Although it is slow compared to other transport, modern sea transport is a highly efficient method of transporting large quantities of goods."
Transport by water is significantly less costly than air transport for transcontinental shipping; short sea shipping and ferries remain viable in coastal areas.
"Short-distance systems exist for sewage, slurry, water and beer, while long-distance networks are used for petroleum and natural gas."
Cable transport is a broad mode where vehicles are pulled by cables instead of an internal power source.
It is most commonly used at steep gradient.
"Typical solutions include aerial tramway, elevators, escalator and ski lifts; some of these are also categorized as conveyor transport."
Spaceflight is transport out of Earth's atmosphere into outer space by means of a spacecraft.
"While large amounts of research have gone into technology, it is rarely used except to put satellites into orbit, and conduct scientific experiments."
"However, man has landed on the moon, and probes have been sent to all the planets of the Solar System."
"Suborbital spaceflight is the fastest of the existing and planned transport systems from a place on Earth to a distant ""other place"" on Earth."
"Faster transport could be achieved through part of a low Earth orbit, or following that trajectory even faster using the propulsion of the rocket to steer it."
"It consists of a roadway, a terminal, and facilities for parking and maintenance."
"For rail, pipeline, road and cable transport, the entire way the vehicle travels must be constructed."
"Air and watercraft are able to avoid this, since the airway and seaway do not need to be constructed."
"However, they require fixed infrastructure at terminals."
"Terminals such as airports, ports, and stations, are locations where passengers and freight can be transferred from one vehicle or mode to another."
"For passenger transport, terminals are integrating different modes to allow riders, who are interchanging between modes, to take advantage of each mode's benefits."
"For instance, airport rail links connect airports to the city centres and suburbs."
"The terminals for automobiles are parking lots, while buses and coaches can operate from simple stops."
"For freight, terminals act as transshipment points, though some cargo is transported directly from the point of production to the point of use."
The financing of infrastructure can either be public or private.
"Transport is often a natural monopoly and a necessity for the public; roads, and in some countries railways and airports are funded through taxation."
New infrastructure projects can have high costs and are often financed through debt.
"Many infrastructure owners, therefore, impose usage fees, such as landing fees at airports, or toll plazas on roads."
"Independent of this, authorities may impose taxes on the purchase or use of vehicles."
"Because of poor forecasting and overestimation of passenger numbers by planners, there is frequently a benefits shortfall for transport infrastructure projects."
"Unlike the infrastructure, the vehicle moves along with the cargo and riders."
"Vehicles also need a system of converting the energy into movement; this is most commonly done through wheels, propellers and pressure."
Vehicles are most commonly staffed by a driver.
"However, some systems, such as people movers and some rapid transits, are fully automated."
"For passenger transport, the vehicle must have a compartment, seat, or platform for the passengers."
"Simple vehicles, such as automobiles, bicycles or simple aircraft, may have one of the passengers as a driver."
"For public transport and freight transport, operations are done through private enterprise or by governments."
"The infrastructure and vehicles may be owned and operated by the same company, or they may be operated by different entities."
"Traditionally, many countries have had a national airline and national railway."
"International shipping remains a highly competitive industry with little regulation, but ports can be public-owned."
Public transport policy must evolve to meet the changing priorities of the urban world.
"The institution of policy enforces order in transport, which is by nature chaotic as people attempt to travel from one place to another as fast as possible."
This policy helps to reduce accidents and save lives.
"However, other uses exist, such as the strategic and tactical relocation of armed forces during warfare, or the civilian mobility construction or emergency equipment."
"Public transport is scheduled services on fixed routes, while private is vehicles that provide ad hoc services at the riders desire."
"The latter offers better flexibility, but has lower capacity, and a higher environmental impact."
"Travel may be as part of daily commuting, for business, leisure or migration."
Short-haul transport is dominated by the automobile and mass transit.
"The latter consists of buses in rural and small cities, supplemented with commuter rail, trams and rapid transit in larger cities."
"Long-haul transport involves the use of the automobile, trains, coaches and aircraft, the last of which have become predominantly used for the longest, including intercontinental, travel."
"Intermodal passenger transport is where a journey is performed through the use of several modes of transport; since all human transport normally starts and ends with walking, all passenger transport can be considered intermodal."
"Public transport may also involve the intermediate change of vehicle, within or across modes, at a transport hub, such as a bus or railway station."
Taxis and buses can be found on both ends of the public transport spectrum.
"Buses are the cheapest mode of transport but are not necessarily flexible, and taxis are very flexible but more expensive."
"In the middle is demand-responsive transport, offering flexibility whilst remaining affordable."
International travel may be restricted for some individuals due to legislation and visa requirements.
"The word is often associated with road-going ""emergency ambulances"", which form part of emergency medical services, administering emergency care to those with acute medical problems."
Air medical services is a comprehensive term covering the use of air transport to move patients to and from healthcare facilities and accident scenes.
"Personnel provide comprehensive prehospital and emergency and critical care to all types of patients during aeromedical evacuation or rescue operations, aboard helicopters, propeller aircraft, or jet aircraft."
"With increased specialization and globalization, production is being located further away from consumption, rapidly increasing the demand for transport."
Transport creates place utility by moving the goods from the place of production to the place of consumption.
"While all modes of transport are used for cargo transport, there is high differentiation between the nature of the cargo transport, in which mode is chosen."
"Logistics refers to the entire process of transferring products from producer to consumer, including storage, transport, transshipment, warehousing, material-handling, and packaging, with associated exchange of information."
Incoterm deals with the handling of payment and responsibility of risk during transport.
"Containerization, with the standardization of ISO containers on all vehicles and at all ports, has revolutionized international and domestic trade, offering a huge reduction in transshipment costs."
"Traditionally, all cargo had to be manually loaded and unloaded into the haul of any ship or car; containerization allows for automated handling and transfer between modes, and the standardized sizes allow for gains in economy of scale in vehicle operation."
"Because of the uniformity of the product, mechanical handling can allow enormous quantities to be handled quickly and efficiently."
"The low value of the cargo combined with high volume also means that economies of scale become essential in transport, and gigantic ships and whole trains are commonly used to transport bulk."
Liquid products with sufficient volume may also be transported by pipeline.
"Air freight has become more common for products of high value; while less than one percent of world transport by volume is by airline, it amounts to forty percent of the value."
"Time has become especially important in regards to principles such as postponement and just-in-time within the value chain, resulting in a high willingness to pay for quick delivery of key components or items of high value-to-weight ratio."
"In addition to mail, common items sent by air include electronics and fashion clothing."
"Throughout history, transport has been a spur to expansion; better transport allows more trade and a greater spread of people."
Economic growth has always been dependent on increasing the capacity and rationality of transport.
"But the infrastructure and operation of transport have a great impact on the land, and transport is the largest drainer of energy, making transport sustainability a major issue."
"Due to the way modern cities and communities are planned and operated, a physical distinction between home and work is usually created, forcing people to transport themselves to places of work, study, or leisure, as well as to temporarily relocate for other daily activities."
"Passenger transport is also the essence of tourism, a major part of recreational transport."
"Commerce requires the transport of people to conduct business, either to allow face-to-face communication for important decisions or to move specialists from their regular place of work to sites where they are needed."
"Using models of transport forecasting, planners are able to predict future transport patterns."
"On the operative level, logistics allows owners of cargo to plan transport as part of the supply chain."
"Transport as a field is also studied through transport economics, a component for the creation of regulation policy by authorities."
"Transport engineering, a sub-discipline of civil engineering, must take into account trip generation, trip distribution, mode choice and route assignment, while the operative level is handled through traffic engineering."
"Because of the negative impacts incurred, transport often becomes the subject of controversy related to choice of mode, as well as increased capacity."
"Automotive transport can be seen as a tragedy of the commons, where the flexibility and comfort for the individual deteriorate the natural and urban environment for all."
"Density of development depends on mode of transport, with public transport allowing for better spatial utilization."
"Good land use keeps common activities close to people's homes and places higher-density development closer to transport lines and hubs, to minimize the need for transport."
There are economies of agglomeration.
"Beyond transport, some land uses are more efficient when clustered."
An efficient transport system can reduce land waste.
Too much infrastructure and too much smoothing for maximum vehicle throughput mean that in many cities there is too much traffic and many—if not all—of the negative impacts that come with it.
"It is only in recent years that traditional practices have started to be questioned in many places; as a result of new types of analysis which bring in a much broader range of skills than those traditionally relied on—spanning such areas as environmental impact analysis, public health, sociology and economics—the viability of the old mobility solutions is increasingly being questioned."
"This creates air pollution, including nitrous oxides and particulates, and is a significant contributor to global warming through emission of carbon dioxide, for which transport is the fastest-growing emission sector."
"By sub-sector, road transport is the largest contributor to global warming."
"Environmental regulations in developed countries have reduced individual vehicles' emissions; however, this has been offset by increases in the numbers of vehicles and in the use of each vehicle."
Some pathways to reduce the carbon emissions of road vehicles considerably have been studied.
"Energy use and emissions vary largely between modes, causing environmentalists to call for a transition from air and road to rail and human-powered transport, as well as increased transport electrification and energy efficiency."
"Other environmental impacts of transport systems include traffic congestion and automobile-oriented urban sprawl, which can consume natural habitat and agricultural lands."
Redirecting vehicle movement to create 20 minute neighbourhoods that promotes exercise while greatly reducing vehicle dependency and pollution.
Some policies are levying a congestion charge to cars for travelling within congested areas during peak time.
"In the 2012 United Nation's World Conference, global leaders unanimously recognized that transport and mobility are central to achieving the sustainability targets."
"In recent years, data has been collected to show that the transport sector contributes to a quarter of the global greenhouse gas emissions and thus, sustainable transport has been mainstreamed across several of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, especially those related to food, security, health, energy, economic growth, infrastructure, and cities and human settlements."
"The domestication of animals introduced a new way to lay the burden of transport on more powerful creatures, allowing the hauling of heavier loads, or humans riding animals for greater speed and duration."
"Water transport, including rowed and sailed vessels, dates back to time immemorial, and was the only efficient way to transport large quantities or over large distances prior to the Industrial Revolution."
"Many early civilizations, including those in Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley, constructed paved roads."
"In classical antiquity, the Persian and Roman empires built stone-paved roads to allow armies to travel quickly."
Deep roadbeds of crushed stone underneath kept such roads dry.
The medieval Caliphate later built tar-paved roads.
The first watercraft were canoes cut out from tree trunks.
"Early water transport was accomplished with ships that were either rowed or used the wind for propulsion, or a combination of the two."
"The importance of water has led to most cities that grew up as sites for trading being located on rivers or on the sea-shore, often at the intersection of two bodies of water."
"Until the Industrial Revolution, transport remained slow and costly, and production and consumption gravitated as close to each other as feasible."
"With telegraphy, communication became instant and independent of the transport of physical objects."
"The invention of the steam engine, closely followed by its application in rail transport, made land transport independent of human or animal muscles."
"Both speed and capacity increased, allowing specialization through manufacturing being located independently of natural resources."
"Later, tarmac and concrete became the dominant paving materials."
"In the 1950s the introduction of containerization gave massive efficiency gains in freight transport, fostering globalization."
"Along with the growth in automobiles and motorways, rail and water transport declined in relative importance."
"There was a strong religious drive for higher moral standards led by the nonconformist churches, such as the Methodists, and the Evangelical wing of the established Church of England."
"Ideologically, the Victorian era witnessed resistance to the rationalism that defined the Georgian period and an increasing turn towards romanticism and even mysticism with regard to religion, social values, and arts."
"Technologically, this era saw a staggering amount of innovations that proved key to Britain's power and prosperity."
Doctors started moving away from tradition and mysticism towards a science-based approach; modern medicine saw the light of day thanks to the adoption of the germ theory of disease and pioneering research in epidemiology.
"Between 1837 and 1901 about 15 million emigrated from Great Britain, mostly to the United States, Canada, South Africa, New Zealand, and Australia."
"Britain embarked on global imperial expansion, particularly in Asia and Africa, which made the British Empire the largest empire in history."
"Britain granted political autonomy to the more advanced colonies of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, and avoided war with the United States."
"These parties were led by such prominent statesmen as Lord Melbourne, Sir Robert Peel, Lord Derby, Lord Palmerston, Benjamin Disraeli, William Gladstone, and Lord Salisbury."
"The unsolved problems relating to Irish Home Rule played a great part in politics in the later Victorian era, particularly in view of Gladstone's determination to achieve a political settlement in Ireland."
"Her reign lasted for 63 years and seven months, a longer period than any of her predecessors."
The term 'Victorian' was in contemporaneous usage to describe the era.
"The era has also been understood in a more extensive sense as a period that possessed sensibilities and characteristics distinct from the periods adjacent to it, in which case it is sometimes dated to begin before Victoria's accession—typically from the passage of or agitation for (during the 1830s) the Reform Act 1832, which introduced a wide-ranging change to the electoral system of England and Wales."
"The Act abolished many borough seats and created others in their place, as well as expanding the franchise in England and Wales (a Scottish Reform Act and Irish Reform Act were passed separately)."
"Her government was led by the Whig prime minister Lord Melbourne, to whom she was close."
"But within two years he had resigned, and the Tory politician Sir Robert Peel attempted to form a new ministry."
Peel said he was willing to become prime minister provided the Queen replaced her Whig ladies-in-waiting with Tory ones.
"She refused and re-appointed Lord Melbourne, a decision criticised as unconstitutional."
"She regularly recorded the events of the rebellions on Upper and Lower Canada as these reminded her of the American Revolution, which took place during the reign of her grandfather King George III."
"It proved a passionate marriage, whose children were much sought after by royal families across Europe."
"An astute diplomat, the Queen was only too willing to arrange such marriages."
"Indeed, she became the ""Grandmother of Europe"" thanks to the nine children she had with Prince Albert in just sixteen years despite suffering from postnatal depression and her dislike of childbirth."
The focus shifted from transportation of criminals to voluntary immigration.
"However, a disastrous retreat from Kabul in the same year led to the annihilation of a British army column in Afghanistan."
"To allow more cheap food into Ireland, the Peel government repealed the Corn Laws."
"The goal was to ensure that Russia could not benefit from the declining status of the Ottoman Empire, a strategic consideration known as the Eastern Question."
"The conflict marked a rare breach in the Pax Britannica, the period of relative peace (1815–1914) that existed among the Great Powers of the time, and especially in Britain's interaction with them."
"On its conclusion in 1856 with the Treaty of Paris, Russia was prohibited from hosting a military presence in Crimea."
"In October of the same year, the Second Opium War saw Britain overpower the Qing dynasty in China."
The princely states were not affected and remained under British guidance.
English was imposed as the medium of education.
Queen Victoria went into mourning and withdrew from public life.
"Whilst the cabinet leaned toward recognition of the Confederacy during the American Civil War, public opinion was split."
Confederate foreign policy planners had hoped that the value of their cotton exports would encourage European powers to intervene in their favour.
"It was not to be, and the British attitude might have been decisive."
Being cut off from cotton did not affect the British economy as much as the Confederates had expected.
A considerable supply was available to Great Britain when the American Civil War erupted and she was able to turn to India and Egypt as alternatives when that ran out.
"In the end, the government decided to remain neutral upon realising that war with the United States would be highly dangerous, for that country provided much of Britain's food supply (especially wheat) and its navy could sink much of the merchant fleet."
"She also mentioned how her late husband Prince Albert had hoped that one day, their sons would rule over the British colonies."
"Victoria in British Columbia and Victoria County in Nova Scotia were named after her, Regina in Saskatchewan in her honour, Prince Edward Island her father, and Alberta her daughter."
"Her birthday, Victoria Day, is an official public holiday in Canada."
"After Prince Edward recovered from typhoid, the Queen decided to give a public thanksgiving service and appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace."
They introduced various reforms aimed at strengthening the political autonomy of large industrial cities and increasing British involvement in the international stage.
Labour movements were recognised and integrated in order to combat extremism.
Both Queen Victoria and Prince Albert favoured moderate improvements to conditions of workers.
Queen Victoria found in Disraeli a trustworthy adviser.
She approved of his policies which helped elevated Britain's status to global superpower.
"In her later years, her popularity soared as she became a symbol of the British Empire."
"There were numerous revolts and violent conflicts in the British Empire, but there were no wars with other major nations."
"In South Africa tensions escalated, especially with the discovery of gold."
By her bedside were her son and heir Edward VII and grandson Kaiser Wilhelm II.
Australia received dominion status in the same year.
"Despite their difficult relations, Edward VII never severed ties with the Queen."
"Like her, he modernised the British monarchy and ensured its survival when so many European royal families collapsed as a result of the First World War."
"The Victorian frame of mind is largely composed of their characteristic modes of thought and feeling""."
"Industrialisation brought with it a rapidly growing middle class whose increase in numbers had a significant effect on the social strata itself: cultural norms, lifestyle, values and morality."
Identifiable characteristics came to define the middle-class home and lifestyle.
"Previously, in town and city, residential space was adjacent to or incorporated into the work site, virtually occupying the same geographical space."
The difference between private life and commerce was a fluid one distinguished by an informal demarcation of function.
"In the Victorian era, English family life increasingly became compartmentalised, the home a self-contained structure housing a nuclear family extended according to need and circumstance to include blood relations."
"The concept of ""privacy"" became a hallmark of the middle-class life."
"Bourgeois existence was a world of interior space, heavily curtained off and wary of intrusion, and opened only by invitation for viewing on occasions such as parties or teas."
"""The essential, unknowability of each individual, and society's collaboration in the maintenance of a façade behind which lurked innumerable mysteries, were the themes which preoccupied many mid-century novelists."""
Three powerful forces were at work.
"First was the rapid rise of the middle class, in large part displacing the complete control long exercised by the aristocracy."
Respectability was their code—a businessman had to be trusted and must avoid reckless gambling and heavy drinking.
"Second, the spiritual reform closely linked to evangelical Christianity, including both the Nonconformist sects, such as the Methodists, and especially the evangelical or Low Church element in the established Church of England, typified by Lord Shaftesbury (1801–1885)."
"It imposed fresh moralistic values on society, such as Sabbath observance, responsibility, widespread charity, discipline in the home, and self-examination for the smallest faults and needs of improvement."
"Starting with the anti-slavery movement of the 1790s, the evangelical moralizers developed highly effective techniques of enhancing the moral sensibilities of all family members and reaching the public at large through intense, very well organized agitation and propaganda."
They focused on exciting a personal revulsion against social evils and personal misbehavior.
"Asa Briggs points out, ""There were as many treatises on 'domestic economy' in mid-Victorian England as on political economy""The third effect came from the liberalism of philosophical utilitarians, led by intellectuals Jeremy Bentham (1748–1832), James Mill (1773–1836) and his son John Stuart Mill (1806–1873)."
They were not moralistic but scientific.
"Their movement, often called ""Philosophic Radicalism,"" fashioned a formula for promoting the goal of ""progress"" using scientific rationality, and businesslike efficiency, to identify, measure, and discover solutions to social problems."
"The formula was an inquiry, legislation, execution, inspection, and report."
Evangelicals and utilitarians shared a basic middle-class ethic of responsibility and formed a political alliance.
"The dissenters gave significant support to moralistic issues, such as temperance and sabbath enforcement."
"The nonconformist conscience, as it was called, was repeatedly called upon by Gladstone for support for his moralistic foreign policy."
"In election after election, Protestant ministers rallied their congregations to the Liberal ticket."
"In Scotland, the Presbyterians played a similar role to the Nonconformist Methodists, Baptists and other groups in England and Wales."
The political strength of Dissent faded sharply after 1920 with the secularization of British society in the 20th century.
Penalties on Roman Catholics were mostly removed.
The Vatican restored the English Catholic bishoprics in 1850 and numbers grew through conversions and immigration from Ireland.
"The Oxford Movement was also occurring around this time, which would draw in new converts to the Catholic Church; among these was John Henry Newman."
Secularism and doubts about the accuracy of the Old Testament grew as the scientific outlooked rapidly gained ground among the better educated.
"""During the mid-nineteenth century, there were two distinct religious mentalities among British academics."
The North British school was religiously conservative and commercially engaged thanks to the influence of Presbyterianism and Calvinism.
"Northern English and Scottish researchers played a key role in the development of thermodynamics, which was motivated by the desire to design ever more efficient engines."
"By contrast, in the South, mentalities of Anglicanism, agnosticism, and even atheism were more common."
"Academics such as the biologist Thomas Huxley promoted ""scientific naturalism."""
"In the 1851 census of church attendance, non-conformists who went to chapel comprised half the attendance of Sunday services."
Nonconformists were focused in the fast-growing urban middle class.
"The two categories of this group were in addition to the evangelicals or ""Low Church"" element in the Church of England: ""Old Dissenters,"" dating from the 16th and 17th centuries, included Baptists, Congregationalists, Quakers, Unitarians, and Presbyterians outside Scotland; ""New Dissenters"" emerged in the 18th century and were mainly Methodists."
"The ""Nonconformist conscience"" of the Old group emphasized religious freedom and equality, the pursuit of justice, and opposition to discrimination, compulsion, and coercion."
"The New Dissenters (and also the Anglican evangelicals) stressed personal morality issues, including sexuality, temperance, family values, and Sabbath-keeping."
"Both factions were politically active, but until the mid-19th century, the Old group supported mostly Whigs and Liberals in politics, while the New—like most Anglicans—generally supported Conservatives."
"In the late 19th century, the New Dissenters mostly switched to the Liberal Party."
"The result was a merging of the two groups, strengthening their great weight as a political pressure group."
"They joined together on new issues especially regarding schools and temperance, with the latter of special interest to Methodists."
"They could not hold most public offices, they had to pay local taxes to the Anglican church, be married by Anglican ministers, and be denied attendance at Oxford or degrees at Cambridge."
Dissenters demanded the removal of political and civil disabilities that applied to them (especially those in the Test and Corporation Acts).
The Anglican establishment strongly resisted until 1828.
Dissenters organized into a political pressure group and succeeded in 1828 in the repeal of some restrictions.
"It was a major achievement for an outside group, but the Dissenters were not finished and the early Victorian period saw them even more active and successful in eliminating their grievances."
"Next on the agenda was the matter of church rates, which were local taxes at the parish level for the support of the parish church building in England and Wales."
Only buildings of the established church received the tax money.
Civil disobedience was attempted but was met with the seizure of personal property and even imprisonment.
"The compulsory factor was finally abolished in 1868 by William Ewart Gladstone, and payment was made voluntary."
"While Gladstone was a moralistic evangelical inside the Church of England, he had strong support in the Nonconformist community."
The Marriage Act 1836 allowed local government registrars to handle marriages.
Nonconformist ministers in their chapels were allowed to marry couples if a registrar was present.
"Also in 1836, civil registration of births, deaths, and marriages was taken from the hands of local parish officials and given to local government registrars."
"Burial of the dead was a more troubling problem, for urban chapels had no graveyards, and Nonconformists sought to use the traditional graveyards controlled by the established church."
Cambridge required that for a diploma.
The two ancient universities opposed giving a charter to the new University of London in the 1830s because it had no such restriction.
"The university, nevertheless, was established in 1837, and by the 1850s Oxford dropped its restrictions."
In 1871 Gladstone sponsored the Universities Tests Act 1871 that provided full access to degrees and fellowships.
"Nonconformists (especially Unitarians and Presbyterians) played major roles in founding new universities in the late 19th century at Manchester, as well as Birmingham, Liverpool and Leeds."
"It was much discussed for several decades, and had its journal edited by William Stewart Ross (1844–1906) the Agnostic Journal and Eclectic Review."
"Interest petered out by the 1890s, and when Ross died the Journal soon closed."
"Ross championed agnosticism in opposition not so much to Christianity, but to atheism, as expounded by Charles Bradlaugh The term ""atheism"" never became popular."
Blasphemy laws meant that promoting atheism could be a crime and was vigorously prosecuted.
"They included John Stuart Mill, Thomas Carlyle, George Eliot and Matthew Arnold."
"They were not necessarily hostile to Christianity, as Huxley repeatedly emphasized."
The literary figures were caught in something of a trap – their business was writing and their theology said there was nothing for certain to write.
They instead concentrated on the argument that it was not necessary to believe in God to behave in moral fashion.
"The scientists, on the other hand, paid less attention to theology and more attention to the exciting issues raised by Charles Darwin in terms of evolution."
The proof of God's existence that said he had to exist to have a marvelously complex world was no longer satisfactory when biology demonstrated that complexity could arise through evolution.
"Worriers repeatedly detected threats that had to be dealt with: working wives, overpaid youths, harsh factory conditions, bad housing, poor sanitation, excessive drinking, and religious decline."
The licentiousness so characteristic of the upper class of the late 18th and early 19th centuries dissipated.
The home became a refuge from the harsh world; middle-class wives sheltered their husbands from the tedium of domestic affairs.
"The number of children shrank, allowing much more attention to be paid to each child."
"Instead, they should dominate in the realm of domestic life, focused on the care of the family, the husband, the children, the household, religion, and moral behavior."
"Religiosity was in the female sphere, and the Nonconformist churches offered new roles that women eagerly entered."
"The poem was not a pure invention but reflected the emerging legal economic social, cultural, religious and moral values of the Victorian middle-class."
"Legally women had limited rights to their bodies, the family property, or their children."
"The recognized identities were those of daughter, wife, mother, and widow."
"Rapid growth and prosperity meant that fewer women had to find paid employment, and even when the husband owned a shop or small business, the wife's participation was less necessary."
"Meanwhile, the home sphere grew dramatically in size; women spent the money and decided on the furniture, clothing, food, schooling, and outward appearance the family would make."
"Patmore's model was widely copied – by Charles Dickens, for example."
"Literary critics of the time suggested that superior feminine qualities of delicacy, sensitivity, sympathy, and sharp observation gave women novelists a superior insight into stories about home family and love."
This made their work highly attractive to the middle-class women who bought the novels and the serialized versions that appeared in many magazines.
"However, a few early feminists called for aspirations beyond the home."
"Cheaper paper and printing technology made it easier for humans to attract mates this way, hence the birth of the Valentine card."
"As a result, cognitive abilities were pushed to their genetic limits, making people more intelligent and innovative than their predecessors."
Formal education thus became vital.
The public school became a model for gentlemen and public service.
Sunday schools and charity schools helped reduce illiteracy.
"In fact, throughout the course of the nineteenth century, there was a clear movement towards universal literacy, culminating in the Elementary Education Act of 1870."
One way to determine the literacy rate is to count those who could sign their names on their marriage registers.
"Using this method, it was established that literacy in England and Wales reached roughly 90% by the late nineteenth century."
"Statistics of literacy from this era are likely underestimates because they were based on the number of people who could write, but throughout most of the nineteenth century, people were typically taught to read before they were taught to write."
Literacy rates were higher in urban than rural areas.
"Named after the three-legged stool students had been sitting on since the fifteenth century, the Tripos included extremely challenging and highly prestigious exams whose most successful candidate for a given year was called the ""Senior Wrangler."""
Below the Senior and Second Wranglers were the Optimes.
"The exams concerned not just pure but also ""mixed"" or applied mathematics."
"Topics ranged widely, from number theory to mathematical physics."
"Candidates needed to have a firm grasp of the works of Sir Isaac Newton and Euclid of Alexandria, trigonometric identities, conic sections, compounded interest, eclipses and more."
"They were marked and scored separately, however, and the results of female candidates were enunciated in comparison to men's, for instance, ""between the 20th and 21st Optimes."""
"At that time, it was commonly thought that women were emotional creatures lacking the mental faculty to master mathematics."
"Thus it was big news when Philippa Fawcett was ranked ""above the Senior Wranger"" in 1890, scoring thirteen percent higher than the top male that year, Geoffrey Thomas Bennett."
"In fact, nursing became even more respected after the brilliant exploits of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War."
Her nursing school at St Thomas' Hospital became a model for others.
"Consequently, for many middle-class young women, the prospects of being a nurse, one of the few career options open to them at the time, became much more appealing."
"It benefited from the introduction of electrical power, rail transport, and telegraphy."
"But as free-to-use libraries sprang up all around the country, people started flocking to them."
Authors and publishers looked for ways to cut prices and increase sales.
"Serialisation in periodicals, especially literary magazines though not newspapers, became popular."
Quality illustrations were commissioned from the reputable artists of the time as an incentive to purchase.
Stories from this period often included strong a moral message.
But it showed signs of growth and some writers decided to seize the opportunity.
"By the middle of the century, commercial publishers came to recognise the great potential of this market and signed deals with gifted authors to provide a plethora of reading materials to children."
They also took advantage of innovations such as those that enable the printing of coloured illustrations.
"As the middle class boomed, people had more money to spend on entertaining their children."
Moral messaging was de-emphasised in favor of fun.
Classics like the tales of the Brothers Grimm and the fairy tales of Hans Christian Andersen made their way to the printing press.
"But it was Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll that proved to be the most popular, alongside the works of William Makepeace Thackeray, Charles Kingsley, Jean Ingelow, and George Macdonald."
"By the 1880s, juvenile fiction packed with action and adventure became commonplace."
"Fantasy did not have a monopoly on the market for children's literature, however."
"As a matter of fact, the market grew so large that most of the top writers of the era wrote at least one book for children."
"Though it remained influential throughout the period, there was a notable resurgence of Gothic fiction in the fin de siècle, such as in Robert Louis Stevenson's novella Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde (1886) and Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray (1891)."
"Following the bicentenary of William Shakespeare in 1769, the popularity of his works steadily grew, reaching a peak in the nineteenth century."
Charles and Mary Lamb appeared to have anticipated this with their Tales from Shakespeare (1807).
"Indeed, as the British population became not just increasingly literate but also well-educated, there was growing demand for science titles."
Mary Somerville became an early and highly successful science writer of the nineteenth century.
"Arguably one of the first books in the genre of popular science, it contained few diagrams and very little mathematics."
It had ten editions and was translated to multiple languages.
"As its name suggests, it offered readers a broad overview of the physical sciences at a time when these studies were becoming increasingly distinct and specialised."
It was the most popular science title from the publisher John Murray until Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species (1859).
"Indeed, the late nineteenth century saw a tremendous amount of technological progress, which inspired authors to write in the genre of science fiction."
"In some instances, science fiction inspired new technology and scientific research."
The researchers found that the more difficult of words were in declining usage and a negative correlation between the use of such words and completed fertility.
"On the other hand, simpler words entered increasingly common use, an effect of rising literacy."
"In another study, from 2017, researchers employed Google's Ngram Viewer, an enormous archive of scanned books, periodicals, and other printed materials dating back to the sixteenth century."
They found that the use of difficult vocabulary increased substantially between the mid-1700s and mid-1800s before declining steadily till the present day.
"Victorian Britain, like the periods before it, was interested in literature, theatre and the arts (see Aesthetic movement and Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood), and music, drama, and opera were widely attended."
"Michael Balfe was the most popular British grand opera composer of the period, while the most popular musical theatre was a series of fourteen comic operas by Gilbert and Sullivan, although there was also musical burlesque and the beginning of Edwardian musical comedy in the 1890s."
Drama ranged from low comedy to Shakespeare (see Henry Irving).
Melodrama—literally 'musical drama'—was introduced in Revolutionary France and reached Great Britain from there during the Victorian era.
It was a particularly widespread and influential theatrical genre thanks to its appeal to the working-class and artisans.
"However, its popularity decline in the late nineteenth century."
The bandstand was a simple construction that not only created an ornamental focal point but also served acoustic requirements whilst providing shelter from the changeable British weather.
It was common to hear the sound of a brass band whilst strolling through parklands.
"Astley's Amphitheatre in Lambeth, London, featuring equestrian acts in a 42-foot wide circus ring, was the center of the 19th-century circus."
"The permanent structure sustained three fires but as an institution lasted a full century, with Andrew Ducrow and William Batty managing the theatre in the middle part of the century."
Fanque also stands out as a black man who achieved great success and enjoyed great admiration among the British public only a few decades after Britain had abolished slavery.
"Another form of entertainment involved ""spectacles"" where paranormal events, such as mesmerism, communication with the dead (by way of mediumship or channeling), ghost conjuring and the like, were carried out to the delight of crowds and participants."
"Particularly in Britain and the United States, this grew into specialist hobbies such as the study of birds, butterflies, seashells (malacology/conchology), beetles and wildflowers."
"Large numbers traveling to quiet fishing villages such as Worthing, Morecambe and Scarborough began turning them into major tourist centers, and people like Thomas Cook saw tourism and even overseas travel as viable businesses."
"Often originating in the public schools, they exemplified new ideals of manliness."
"Charles Barry's architecture for the new Palace of Westminster, which had been badly damaged in an 1834 fire, was built in the medieval style of Westminster Hall, the surviving part of the building."
"It constructed a narrative of cultural continuity, set in opposition to the violent disjunctions of Revolutionary France, a comparison common to the period, as expressed in Thomas Carlyle's The French Revolution: A History and Charles Dickens' Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities."
"At its centre was the Crystal Palace, a modular glass and iron structure – the first of its kind."
It was condemned by Ruskin as the very model of mechanical dehumanisation in design but later came to be presented as the prototype of Modern architecture.
"The emergence of photography, showcased at the Great Exhibition, resulted in significant changes in Victorian art with Queen Victoria being the first British monarch to be photographed."
"In general, various styles of painting were popular during the Victorian period, Classicism, Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Impressionism, and Post-impressionism."
"In 1848, Dante Rossetti and William Holman Hunt created the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood whose stated aim was to produce paintings of photographic quality, taking inspiration from a variety of sources, from the works of William Shakespeare to Mother Nature herself."
The growing popularity of romantic love spilled over into literature and fine arts.
The Times originated the practice of sending war correspondents to cover particular conflicts.
"Russell wrote one dispatch that highlighted the surgeons' ""inhumane barbarity"" and the lack of ambulance care for wounded troops."
"Its most famous editor, Charles Prestwich Scott, made the Guardian into a world-famous newspaper in the 1890s."
The Daily Telegraph in 1856 became the first penny newspaper in London.
It was funded by advertising revenue based on a large audience.
"By 1857, Cole planned to build one with ""due regard to the principles of sound."""
"Furthermore, a system of routine annual holidays came into play, starting with white-collar workers and moving into the working-class."
It provided scheduled entertainment of suitable length at convenient locales at inexpensive prices.
"These included sporting events, music halls, and popular theatre."
"By 1880 football was no longer the preserve of the social elite, as it attracted large working-class audiences."
"Professional sports were the norm, although some new activities reached an upscale amateur audience, such as lawn tennis and golf."
"Women were now allowed in some sports, such as archery, tennis, badminton and gymnastics."
"At the time, Thomas Malthus believed this lack of growth outside Britain was due the carrying capacity of their local environments."
"That is, the tendency of a population to expand geometrically while resources grew more slowly, reaching a crisis (such as famine, war, or epidemic) which would reduce the population to a more sustainable size."
Two major contributory factors were fertility rates and mortality rates.
Britain was the first country to undergo the demographic transition and the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions.
"Economist Gary Becker argued that at first, falling fertility is due to urbanisation and lower infant mortality rates, which diminished the benefits and increased the costs of raising children."
"In other words, it became more economically sensible to invest more in fewer children."
This is known as the first demographic transition.
"Initially, child mortality rates dropped significantly due to improved healthcare and sanitation and better nutrition, yet fertility rates remained high, leading to a population boom."
"Gradually, fertility rates fell as people became more affluent and had better access to contraception."
There were several reasons for this.
"One is biological: with improving living standards, a higher proportion of women were biologically able to have children."
Another possible explanation is social.
"In the 19th century, the marriage rate increased, and people were getting married at a very young age until the end of the century, when the average age of marriage started to increase again slowly."
The reasons why people got married younger and more frequently are uncertain.
One theory is that greater prosperity allowed people to finance marriage and new households earlier than previously possible.
"With more births within marriage, it seems inevitable that marriage rates and birth rates would rise together."
Birth rates were originally measured by the 'crude birth rate' – births per year divided by total population.
"This is indeed a crude measure, as key groups and their fertility rates are not clear."
It is likely to be affected mainly by changes in the age distribution of the population.
The Net Reproduction Rate was then introduced as an alternative measure: it measures the average fertility rate of women of child-bearing ages.
High rates of birth also occurred because of a lack of birth control.
Mainly because women lacked knowledge of birth control methods and the practice was seen as unrespectable.
"Moreover, it was the poor who had had an incentive to curb their fertility whereas the rich had lacked such a need due to greater wealth and lower child mortality rates."
This changed due to the Industrial Revolution.
Standards of living improved and mortality rates fell.
People no longer needed to have as many children as before to ensure the propagation of their genes.
The link between poverty and child mortality weakened.
"In addition, societal attitude towards contraception warmed, leading to the negative correlation between intelligence and fertility."
"Improvements in nutrition may also have played a role, though its importance is still debated."
But the nineteenth century saw dramatic technological development.
"Engineering prowess, especially in communication and transportation, made Great Britain the leading industrial powerhouse and trading nation of the world at that time."
"Excelling in the bulk movement of coal, they provided the fuel for the furnaces of industry and for domestic fireplaces."
Millions of people were able to travel who had scarcely ever travelled before.
"Railways enabled mail, newspapers, periodicals and cheap literature to be distributed easily, quickly and cheaply allowing a much wider and faster dissemination of ideas and information."
It was not till the two to three decades following the Second World War that substantial economic growth was seen again.
"In the long-term view, the mid-Victorian boom was one upswing in the Kondratiev cycle (see figure)."
"There was prosperity, as the national income per person grew by half."
"Much of the prosperity was due to the increasing industrialisation, especially in textiles and machinery, as well as to the worldwide network of exports that produced profits for British merchants."
British entrepreneurs built railways in India and many independent nations.
"Opposition to the new order melted away, says Porter."
"The Chartist movement peaked as a democratic movement among the working class in 1848; its leaders moved to other pursuits, such as trade unions and cooperative societies."
"The working class ignored foreign agitators like Karl Marx in their midst, and joined in celebrating the new prosperity."
Employers typically were paternalistic and generally recognised the trade unions.
"Companies provided their employees with welfare services ranging from housing, schools and churches, to libraries, baths, and gymnasia."
"Middle-class reformers did their best to assist the working classes' aspirations to middle-class norms of ""respectability""."
"There was a spirit of libertarianism, says Porter, as people felt they were free."
"Taxes were very low, and government restrictions were minimal."
"There were still problem areas, such as occasional riots, especially those motivated by anti-Catholicism."
"Society was still ruled by the aristocracy and the gentry, who controlled high government offices, both houses of Parliament, the church, and the military."
Becoming a rich businessman was not as prestigious as inheriting a title and owning a landed estate.
"Literature was doing well, but the fine arts languished as the Great Exhibition of 1851 showcased Britain's industrial prowess rather than its sculpture, painting or music."
The educational system was mediocre; the main universities (outside Scotland) were likewise mediocre.
"The scales were less weighted against the weak, against women and children, and against the poor."
"There was greater movement, and less of the fatalism of an earlier age."
Yet England in 1871 was by no means an earthly paradise.
The housing and conditions of life of the working class in town & country were still a disgrace to an age of plenty.
"In December 1844, Rochdale Society of Equitable Pioneers founded what is considered the first cooperative in the world."
"The founding members were a group of 28, around half of which were weavers, who decided to band together to open a store owned and managed democratically by the members, selling food items they could not otherwise afford."
"Ten years later, the British co-operative movement had grown to nearly 1,000 co-operatives."
"The movement also spread across the world, with the first cooperative financial institution founded in 1850 in Germany."
"The critical factor was financing, which was handled by building societies that dealt directly with large contracting firms."
Private renting from housing landlords was the dominant tenure.
"People moved in so rapidly that there was not enough capital to build adequate housing for everyone, so low income newcomers squeezed into increasingly overcrowded slums."
"Clean water, sanitation, and public health facilities were inadequate; the death rate was high, especially infant mortality, and tuberculosis among young adults."
"Wage rates improved steadily; real wages (after taking inflation into account) were 65 percent higher in 1901, compared to 1871."
"People flooded into industrial areas and commercial cities faster than housing could be built, resulting in overcrowding and lagging sanitation facilities such as fresh water and sewage."
"These problems were magnified in London, where the population grew at record rates."
"Large houses were turned into flats and tenements, and as landlords failed to maintain these dwellings, slum housing developed."
"In big, once handsome houses, thirty or more people of all ages may inhabit a single room."""
"Significant changes happened in the British Poor Law system in England and Wales, Scotland, and Ireland."
"These included a large expansion in workhouses (or poorhouses in Scotland), although with changing populations during the era."
"Child labour played an important role in the Industrial Revolution from its outset: novelist Charles Dickens, for example, worked at the age of 12 in a blacking factory, with his family in a debtors' prison."
Reformers wanted the children in school: in 1840 only about 20 percent of the children in London had any schooling.
"Agile boys were employed by the chimney sweeps; small children were employed to scramble under machinery to retrieve cotton bobbins; and children were also employed to work in coal mines, crawling through tunnels too narrow and low for adults."
"Children also worked as errand boys, crossing sweepers, shoe blacks, or sold matches, flowers, and other cheap goods."
"Some children undertook work as apprentices to respectable trades, such as building, or as domestic servants (there were over 120,000 domestic servants in London in the mid 19th century)."
"Working hours were long: builders might work 64 hours a week in summer and 52 in winter, while domestic servants were theoretically on duty 80-hours a week."
"Mother bides at home, she is troubled with bad breath, and is sair weak in her body from early labour."
"I am wrought with sister and brother, it is very sore work; cannot say how many rakes or journeys I make from pit's bottom to wall face and back, thinks about 30 or 25 on the average; the distance varies from 100 to 250 fathom."
"In its first years, the Institution was dedicated to the improvement of agriculture using chemistry, prompted by trade restrictions with Europe."
Such practical concerns continued through the next two centuries.
"However, it soon became apparent that additional funding was required in order for the Institution to continue."
Some well-known experts were hired as lecturers and researchers.
"The most successful of them all was Sir Humphry Davy, whose lectures concerned a myriad of topics and were so popular that the original practical purpose of the Institution faded away."
"It was slow to reach Britain, however."
Master of Trinity College William Whewell coined the term scientist in 1833 to describe the new professional breed specialists and experts studying what was still commonly known as natural philosophy.
I should incline to call him a Scientist.
The new term signaled the recognition of the importance of empiricism and inductive reasoning.
But this term was slow to catch on.
"It was possible for a scientist to ""earn praise but not pudding,"" he wrote."
"Since its birth, the Royal Society of London had been a club of gentlemanly amateurs, though some of whom were the very best in their fields, people like Charles Darwin and James Prescott Joule."
Britain was the leading world centre for advanced engineering and technology.
Its engineering firms were in worldwide demand for designing and constructing railways.
"In many cases, from planetary science to mammalian biology, the ease of discovery since the 1700s and 1800s can be fitted to an exponentially decaying curve."
"But the rate of progress is also dependent on other factors, such as the number of researchers, the level of funding, and advances in technology."
Thus the number of new species of mammals discovered between the late 1700s and late 1800s followed grew exponentially before leveling off in the 1900s; the general shape is known as the logistic curve.
"In other cases, a branch of study reached the point of saturation."
"Despite the despondency of many Victorian-era scientists, who thought that all that remained was measuring quantities to the next decimal place and that new discoveries would not change the contemporary scientific paradigm, as the nineteenth century became the twentieth, science witnessed truly revolutionary discoveries, such as radioactivity, and basic science continued its advance, though a number of twentieth-century scientists shared the same pessimism as their late-Victorian counterparts."
"William Playfair, who created charts of all sorts, justified it thus, ""a man who has carefully investigated a printed table, finds, when done, that he has only a very faint and partial idea of what he has read; and that like a figure imprinted on sand, is soon totally erased and defaced."""
"For example, in a chart showing the relationship between population and government revenue of some European nations, he used the areas of circles to represent the geographical sizes of those nations."
In the same graph he used the slopes of lines to indicate the tax burden of a given population.
"While serving as nurse during the Crimean War, Florence Nightingale drew the first pie charts representing the monthly fatality rates of the conflict, distinguishing deaths due to battle wounds (innermost section), those due to infectious disease (outer section), and to other causes (middle section)."
"Her charts clearly showed that most deaths resulted from disease, which led the general public to demand improved sanitation at field hospitals."
Belgian sociologist and statistician Adolphe Quetelet discovered that its extremely wide applicability in his analysis of vast amounts of statistics of human physical characteristics such as height and other traits such as criminality and alcoholism.
"Queletet derived the concept of the ""average man"" from his studies."
Sir Francis Galton employed Quetelet's ideas in his research on mathematical biology.
"He invented what he called the ""quincunx"" to demonstrate why mixtures of normal distributions were normal."
"Galton noticed that the means of a particular trait in the offspring generation differed from those of the parent generation, a phenomenon now known as regression to the mean."
"Francis Edgeworth developed a test for statistical significance that estimated the ""fluctuations""—twice the variance in modern language—from two given means."
"By modern standards, however, he was extremely conservative when it comes to drawing conclusions about the significance of an observation."
"But this paper fell on deaf ears until William Thomson read it, realised its significance, and had it re-printed in 1850."
"Green's work became a source of inspiration for the Cambridge school of mathematical physicists, which included Thomson himself, George Gabriel Stokes, and James Clerk Maxwell."
"Green's Essay contained what became known as Green's theorem, a basic result in vector calculus, Green's identities, and the notion of Green's functions, which appears in the study of differential equations."
"Thomson went on to prove Stokes' theorem, which earned that name after Stokes asked students to prove in the Smith's Prize exam in 1854."
"Stokes' theorem generalises Green's theorem, which itself is a higher-dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus."
"The term matrix was coined by James Joseph Sylvester, a major contributor to the theory of determinants."
It is difficult to overestimate the value of matrix theory to modern theoretical physics.
"Peter Tait wrote, prophetically, that Cayley was ""forging the weapons for future generations of physicists."""
It was during the nineteenth century that scientists began to work out a thorough theory.
"In 1821, using an analogy with elastic bodies, French professor of mechanics Claude-Louis Navier arrived at the basic equations of motion for viscous fluids."
"In it, Stokes sought to develop a mathematical description for all known fluids that take into account viscosity, or internal friction."
Scientific problems thus became the impetus for the development of the subject.
William Rowan Hamilton advanced it in his course to construct a deductive framework for optics; he then applied the same ideas to mechanics.
"With an appropriate variational principle, one could deduce the equations of motion for a given mechanical or optical system."
"Soon, scientists worked out the variational principles for the theory of elasticity, electromagnetism, and fluid mechanics (and, in the future, relativity and quantum theory)."
"Whilst variational principles did not necessarily provide a simpler way to solve problems, they were of interest for philosophical or aesthetic reasons, though scientists at this time were not as motivated by religion in their work as their predecessors."
Hamilton's work in physics was great achievement; he was able to provide a unifying mathematical framework for wave propagation and particle motion.
"In light of this description, it becomes clear why the wave and corpuscle theories of light were equally able to account for the phenomena of reflection and refraction."
"Although the paper was read before the Society and its abstract published, Waterson's paper faced antipathy."
"At this time, the kinetic theory of gases was considered highly speculative as it was based on the then not-accepted atomic hypothesis."
"In the 1860s, James Clerk Maxwell published a series of papers on the subject."
"Unlike those of his predecessors, who were only using averages, Maxwell's papers were explicitly statistical in nature."
He proposed that the speeds of molecules in a gas followed a distribution.
"Although the speeds would cluster around the average, some molecules were moving faster or slower than this average."
"He showed that this distribution is a function of temperature and mathematically described various properties of gases, such as diffusion and viscosity."
"He predicted, surprisingly, that the viscosity of a gas is independent of its density."
"This was verified at once by a series of experiments Maxwell conducted with his wife, Katherine."
"Experimental verification of the Maxwell distribution was not obtained till 60 years later, however."
Such coordinates are associated with conserved momenta and as such are useful in problem solving.
Routh also devised a new method for solving problems in mechanics.
"At that time, classical mechanics in general and the three-body problem in particular captured the imagination of many talented mathematicians, whose contributions Whittaker covered in his Report."
It helped provide the scientific basis for the aerospace industry in the twentieth century.
"Despite its age, it remains in print in the early twenty-first century."
Brewer and amateur scientist James Prescott Joule was one of the proponents of the latter.
"Joule's intricate experiments—the most successful of which involved heating water with paddle wheels—making full use of his skill in temperature control as a brewer, demonstrated decisively the reality of the ""mechanical equivalent of heat."""
"What would later become known as the ""conservation of energy"" was pursued by many other workers approaching the subject from a variety of backgrounds, from medicine and physiology to physics and engineering."
"Another notable contributor to this development was the German researcher Hermann von Helmholtz, who gave an essentially Newtonian, that is, mechanical, account."
"William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) received the works of Joule and Helmholtz positively, embracing them as providing support for the emerging ""science of energy."""
"Indeed, the commercial value of new science had already become apparent by this time; some businessmen were quite willing to offer generous financial support for researchers."
"Rankine spoke confidently of the new science of thermodynamics, a term Kelvin coined in 1854, whose fundamental principles came to be known as the First and Second Laws and whose core concepts were ""energy"" and ""entropy."""
Kelvin and Peter Guthrie Tait's Treatise on Natural Philosophy (1867) was an attempt to reformulate physics in terms of energy.
"Here, Kelvin and Tait introduced the phrase kinetic energy (instead of 'actual'), now in standard usage."
"Natural ice was vigorously traded in the early nineteenth century, but it was inevitably in short supply, especially in Australia."
"During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, there was considerable commercial incentive to develop ever more effective refrigerators thanks to the expansion of agriculture in the Americas, Australia, and New Zealand and rapid urbanization in Western Europe."
"From the 1830s onward, refrigerators relied on the expansion of compressed air or the evaporation of a volatile liquid; evaporation became the basis of all modern refrigerator designs."
Scientists began trying to reach ever lower temperatures and to liquefy every gas they encountered.
This paved the way for the development of low-temperature physics and the Third Law of Thermodynamics.
Research in geology and evolutionary biology naturally led to the question of how old the Earth was.
"With the advent of thermodynamics, it became clear that the Earth and the Sun must have an old but finite age."
"Whatever the energy source of the Sun, it must be finite, and since it is constantly dissipating, there must be a day when the Sun runs out of energy."
He reached comparable figures for the Earth.
"The missing ingredient here was radioactivity, which was not known to science till the end of the nineteenth century."
Michael Faraday set himself to the task of clarifying the nature of electricity and magnetism by experiments.
"In doing so, he devised what could be described as the first electric motor (though it does not resemble a modern one), a transformer (now used to step up the voltage and step down the current or vice versa), and a dynamo (which contains the basics of all electric turbine generators)."
The practical value of Faraday's research on electricity and magnetism was nothing short of revolutionary.
A dynamo converts mechanical energy into an electrical current whilst a motor does the reverse.
"The world's first power plants entered service in 1883, and by the following year, people realized the possibility of using electricity to power a variety of household appliances."
"Drawing on the work of his predecessors, especially the experimental research of Michael Faraday, the analogy with heat flow by Lord Kelvin, and the mathematical analysis of George Green, James Clerk Maxwell synthesized all that was known about electricity and magnetism into a single mathematical framework, Maxwell's equations."
"Maxwell used his equations to predict the existence of electromagnetic waves, which travel at the speed of light."
"In other words, light is but one kind of electromagnetic wave."
"Maxwell's theory predicted there ought to be other types, with different frequencies."
"After some ingenious experiments, Maxwell's prediction was confirmed by German physicist Heinrich Hertz."
"In the process, Hertz generated and detected what are now called radio waves and built crude radio antennas and the predecessors of satellite dishes."
"Dutch physicist Hendrik Lorentz derived, using suitable boundary conditions, Fresnel's equations for the reflection and transmission of light in different media from Maxwell's equations."
He also showed that Maxwell's theory succeeded in illuminating the phenomenon of light dispersion where other models failed.
"John William Strutt (Lord Rayleigh) and the American Josiah Willard Gibbs then proved that the optical equations derived from Maxwell's theory are the only self-consistent description of the reflection, refraction, and dispersion of light consistent with experimental results."
"Maxwell originally wrote down a grand total of 20 equations for the electromagnetic field, which he later reduced to eight."
"Heaviside rewrote them in the form commonly used today, just four expressions."
"In addition, Heaviside was responsible for considerable progress in electrical telegraphy, telephony, and the study of the propagation of electromagnetic waves."
"Independent of Gibbs, Heaviside assembled a set of mathematical tools known as vector calculus to replace the quaternions, which were in vogue at the time but which Heaviside dismissed as ""antiphysical and unnatural."
"""Faraday also investigated how electrical currents affected chemical solutions."
His experiments led him to the two laws of electrochemistry.
"Together with Whewell, Faraday introduced the basic vocabulary for the subject, the words electrode, anode, cathode, electrolysis, electrolyte, ion, anion, and cation."
They remain in standard usage.
But Faraday's work was of value to more than just chemists.
"In his Faraday Memorial Lecture in 1881, the German Hermann von Helmholtz asserted that Faraday's laws of electrochemistry hinted at the atomic structure of matter."
"While the Germans thought cathode rays were waves, the British and the French believed they were particles."
"In addition, because the ratio was the same regardless of the metal used, Thompson concluded that electrons must be a constituent of all atoms."
"Although the atoms of each chemical elements have different numbers of electrons, all electrons are identical."
"His stated goal was to ""investigate the fundamental laws of those operations of the mind by which reasoning is performed; to give expression to them in the symbolical language of a Calculus, and upon this foundation to establish the science of logical and construct its methods."""
"In fact, it can be traced all the way back to the Hellenistic Civilization."
"While people have devised such machines over the centuries, mathematicians continued to perform calculations by hand, as machines offered little advantage in speed."
"For complicated calculations, they employed tables, especially of logarithmic and trigonometric functions, which were computed by hand."
"But right in the middle of the Industrial Revolution in England, Charles Babbage thought of using the all-important steam engine to power a mechanical computer, the Difference Engine."
"Unfortunately, whilst Babbage managed to secure government funds for the construction of the machine, the government subsequently lost and interest and Babbage faced considerable troubles developing the necessary machine components."
"He abandoned the project to pursue a new one, his Analytical Engine."
"Like a modern computer, it consisted of two basic parts, one that stores the numbers to be processed (the store), and one that performed the operations (the mill)."
"Babbage adopted the concept of punch cards from the French engineer Joseph Jacquard, who had used it to automate the textile industry in France, to control the operations of his Analytical Engine."
"Unfortunately, he again lacked the financial resources to build it, and so it remained a theoretical construct."
Ada Lovelace translated the notes published by one of the attendees into English and heavily annotated it.
"She wrote down the very first computer program, in her case one for computing the Bernoulli numbers."
It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform.
It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.
But it is likely to exert an indirect and reciprocal influence on science itself in another manner.
"It is however pretty evident, on general principles, that in devising for mathematical truths a new form in which to record and throw themselves out for actual use, views are likely to be induced, which should again react on the more theoretical phase of the subject."
"This technology, which predates the Victorian era, had a long a rich history."
"International trade and travel boosted demand, and there was intense competition among the shipping companies."
"Steam ships such as the SS Great Britain and SS Great Western made international travel more common but also advanced trade, so that in Britain it was not just the luxury goods of earlier times that were imported into the country but essentials and raw materials such as corn and cotton from the United States and meat and wool from Australia."
"Even when she was finally broken up for scraps in 1888, she was still the largest ship in the world."
"Her record was not broken till the Edwardian era with super liners like the Lusitania in 1907, the Titanic in 1912."
"Yet despite being a remarkable feat of engineering, the Great Eastern became more and more of a white elephant as smaller and faster ships were in greater demand."
"Nevertheless, she gained a new lease of life when she was chartered to lay telegraphic cables across the Atlantic, and then to India."
"For that reason, it deployed the Royal Navy to protect maritime trade routes and financed the construction of many steam ships."
"In 1837, William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone invented a telegraphic system that used electrical currents to deflect magnetic needles, thus transmitting coded messages."
"This design soon made its way all across Britain, appearing in every town and post office."
"In 1866, the SS Great Eastern successfully laid the transatlantic telegraphic cable."
"Like the telegraph, the telephone enabled rapid personal communication."
"Receiving little support in his native Italy, Guglielmo Marconi moved to England and adapted Hertz's equipment for this purpose in the 1890s."
"He achieved the first international wireless transmission between England and France in 1900 and by the following year, he succeeded in sending messages in Morse code across the Atlantic."
"Seeing its value, the shipping industry adopted this technology at once."
Radio broadcasting became extremely popular in the twentieth century and remains in common use in the early twenty-first.
"The new railways all allowed goods, raw materials, and people to be moved about, rapidly facilitating trade and industry."
The financing of railways became an important specialty of London's financiers.
They retained an ownership share even while turning over management to locals; that ownership was largely liquidated in 1914–1916 to pay for the World War.
"Railroads originated in England because industrialists had already discovered the need for inexpensive transportation to haul coal for the new steam engines, to supply parts to specialized factories, and to take products to market."
The existing system of canals was inexpensive but was too slow and too limited in geography.
"The engineers and businessmen needed to create and finance a railway system were available; they knew how to invent, to build, and to finance a large complex system."
The first quarter of the 19th century involved numerous experiments with locomotives and rail technology.
"On his first run, his locomotive pulled 38 freight and passenger cars at speeds as high as 12 miles per hour."
Brassey took thousands of British engineers and mechanics across the globe to build new lines.
"They invented and improved thousands of mechanical devices, and developed the science of civil engineering to build roadways, tunnels and bridges."
"Britain had a superior financial system based in London that funded both the railways in Britain and also in many other parts of the world, including the United States, up until 1914."
"The canal companies, unable or unwilling to upgrade their facilities to compete with railways, used political power to try to stop them."
"The railways responded by purchasing about a fourth of the canal system, in part to get the right of way, and in part to buy off critics."
"By 1850, rates had fallen to a penny a ton mile for coal, at speeds of up to fifty miles an hour."
"Britain now had had the model for the world in a well integrated, well-engineered system that allowed fast, cheap movement of freight and people, and which could be replicated in other major nations."
"The railways directly or indirectly employed tens of thousands of engineers, mechanics, repairmen and technicians, as well as statisticians and financial planners."
They developed new and more efficient and less expensive techniques.
"Most important, they created a mindset of how technology could be used in many different forms of business."
Railways had a major impact on industrialization.
"By lowering transportation costs, they reduced costs for all industries moving supplies and finished goods, and they increased demand for the production of all the inputs needed for the railroad system itself."
"Parts of the first such railway, the Metropolitan Line, opened to the public in 1863, thereby becoming the first subway line in the world."
"That same year, the whole system became officially known as the Tube after the shape of the rail tunnels."
The system was overbuilt and much too elaborate and expensive for the small amount of freight traffic it carried.
"However, it did capture the imagination of the Indians, who saw their railways as the symbol of an industrial modernity—but one that was not realized until a century or so later."
"The model town of Saltaire was founded, along with others, as a planned environment with good sanitation and many civic, educational and recreational facilities, although it lacked a pub, which was regarded as a focus of dissent."
"Although initially developed in the early years of the 19th century, gas lighting became widespread during the Victorian era in industry, homes, public buildings and the streets."
The invention of the incandescent gas mantle in the 1890s greatly improved light output and ensured its survival as late as the 1960s.
Hundreds of gasworks were constructed in cities and towns across the country.
Medicine progressed during Queen Victoria's reign.
"In fact, medicine at the start of the nineteenth century was little different from that in the medieval era whereas by the end of the century, it became a lot closer to twenty-first century practice thanks to advances in science, especially microbiology, paving the way for the germ theory of disease."
"This was during the height of the Industrial Revolution, and urbanisation occurred at a frantic pace."
"He asked that the pump's handle be replaced, after which the epidemic petered out."
"Snow also discovered that households whose water supplies came from companies that used the Thames downstream, after many sewers had flown into the river, were fourteen times more likely to die from cholera."
A great engineering feat in the Victorian Era was the sewage system in London.
Many problems were encountered but the sewers were completed.
"After this, Bazalgette designed the Thames Embankment which housed sewers, water pipes and the London Underground."
"Using his political influence, he garnered support for the Public Health Act of 1875, which focused on preventative measures in housing, the water supply, sewage and drainage, providing Britain with an extensive public health system."
"By mid-century, the stethoscope became an oft-used device and designs of the microscope had advanced enough for scientists to closely examine pathogens."
The pioneering work of French microbiologist Louis Pasteur from the 1850s earned widespread acceptance for the germ theory of disease.
It led to the introduction antiseptics by Joseph Lister in 1867 in the form of carbolic acid (phenol).
"He instructed the hospital staff to wear gloves and wash their hands, instruments, and dressings with a phenol solution and in 1869, he invented a machine that would spray carbolic acid in the operating theatre during surgery."
"Chloroform was favoured by doctors and hospital staff because it is much less flammable than ether, but critics complained that it could cause the patient to have a heart attack."
Chloroform gained in popularity in England and Germany after John Snow gave Queen Victoria chloroform for the birth of her eighth child (Prince Leopold).
"At the same time sugar consumption in the British diet increased, greatly increasing instances of tooth decay."
"As a result, more and more people were having teeth extracted and needing dentures."
"This gave rise to ""Waterloo Teeth"", which were real human teeth set into hand-carved pieces of ivory from hippopotamus or walrus jaws."
"Its medical value was realised immediately, and within a year, doctors were prescribing X-rays for diagnosis, in particular to locate bone fractures and foreign objects inside the patient's body."
Urbanisation aided the spread of diseases and squalid living conditions in many places exacerbated the problem.
"Moreover, while some diseases, such as cholera, were being driven out, others, such as sexually transmitted diseases, made themselves felt."
The changes in moral standards and actual behaviour across the British were profound.
Historians continue to debate the various causes of this dramatic change.
"Asa Briggs emphasizes the strong reaction against the French Revolution, and the need to focus British efforts on its defeat and not be diverged by pleasurable sins."
"Briggs also stresses the powerful role of the evangelical movement among the Nonconformists, as well as the Evangelical faction inside the established Church of England."
There is a debate whether the working classes followed suit.
Moralists in the late 19th century such as Henry Mayhew decried the slums for their supposed high levels of cohabitation without marriage and illegitimate births.
"Slowly capital punishment was replaced by transportation, first to the American colonies and then to Australia, and, especially, by long-term incarceration in newly built prisons."
"As one historian points out, ""Public and violent punishment which attacked the body by branding, whipping, and hanging was giving way to reformation of the mind of the criminal by breaking his spirit, and encouraging him to reflect on his shame, before labour and religion transformed his character."""
"Crime rates went up, leading to calls for harsher measures to stop the 'flood of criminals' released under the penal servitude system."
"The reaction from the committee set up under the commissioner of prisons, Colonel Edmund Frederick du Cane, was to increase minimum sentences for many offences with deterrent principles of 'hard labour, hard fare, and a hard bed'."
"As the prisons grew more numerous, they became more depraved."
"By the Victorian era, penal transportation to Australia was falling out of use since it did not reduce crime rates."
"The British penal system underwent a transition from harsh punishment to reform, education, and training for post-prison livelihoods."
The reforms were controversial and contested.
Previously tens of thousands of prisoners had been sentenced solely for that reason.
"The principal reformer was Sir Evelyn Ruggles-Brise, the chair of the Prison Commission."
"Estimates of the number of prostitutes in London in the 1850s vary widely, but in his landmark study, Prostitution, William Acton reported an estimation of 8,600 prostitutes in London alone in 1857."
The differing views on prostitution have made it difficult to understand its history.
Judith Walkowitz has multiple works focusing on the feminist point of view on the topic of prostitution.
"Many sources blame economic disparities as leading factors in the rise of prostitution, and Walkowitz writes that the demographic within prostitution varied greatly."
"However, women who struggled financially were much more likely to be prostitutes than those with a secure source of income."
Orphaned or half-orphaned women were more likely to turn to prostitution as a means of income.
"While overcrowding in urban cities and the amount of job opportunities for females were limited, Walkowitz argues that there were other variables that lead women to prostitution."
Walkowitz acknowledges that prostitution allowed for women to feel a sense of independence and self-respect.
"Although many assume that pimps controlled and exploited these prostitutes, some women managed their own clientele and pricing."
"It is evident that women were exploited by this system, yet Walkowitz says that prostitution was often their opportunity to gain social and economic independence."
"While there were plenty of people publicly denouncing prostitution in England, there were also others who took opposition to them."
One event that sparked a lot of controversy was the implementation of the Contagious Diseases Acts.
"If the suspected woman was found with a venereal disease, they placed the woman into a Lock Hospital."
Arguments made against the acts claimed that the regulations were unconstitutional and that they only targeted women.
"Because women were excluded from the first National Association, the Ladies National Association was formed."
The leader of that organization was Josephine Butler.
Butler was an outspoken feminist during this time who fought for many social reforms.
It involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis.
"Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), premeditated death from starvation, massacres, and disease."
"Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, including in strategic bombing of population centres, the development of nuclear weapons, and the only two uses of such in war."
"Following a US declaration of war against Japan, which followed one from the UK, the European Axis powers declared war on the United States in solidarity with their ally."
"Japan soon captured much of the Western Pacific, but its advances were halted in 1942 after losing the critical Battle of Midway; later, Germany and Italy were defeated in North Africa and at Stalingrad in the Soviet Union."
"The war in Europe concluded with the liberation of German-occupied territories, and the invasion of Germany by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union, culminating in the fall of Berlin to Soviet troops, the suicide of Adolf Hitler and the German unconditional surrender on 8 May 1945."
"Following the Potsdam Declaration by the Allies on 26 July 1945 and the refusal of Japan to surrender on its terms, the United States dropped the first atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima, on 6 August 1945, and Nagasaki, on 9 August."
"Faced with an imminent invasion of the Japanese archipelago, the possibility of additional atomic bombings, and the Soviet entry into the war against Japan and its invasion of Manchuria on 9 August, Japan announced its intention to surrender on 15 August 1945, cementing total victory in Asia for the Allies."
"In the wake of the war, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders."
"The United Nations (UN) was established to foster international co-operation and prevent future conflicts, and the victorious great powers—China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States—became the permanent members of its Security Council."
"The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the nearly half-century-long Cold War."
"In the wake of European devastation, the influence of its great powers waned, triggering the decolonisation of Africa and Asia."
Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards economic recovery and expansion.
"Political integration, especially in Europe, began as an effort to forestall future hostilities, end pre-war enmities and forge a sense of common identity."

A 1990 treaty regarding Germany's future allowed the reunification of East and West Germany to take place and resolved most post-World War II issues.
No formal peace treaty between Japan and the Soviet Union was ever signed.
"Meanwhile, the victorious Allies of World War I, such as France, Belgium, Italy, Romania, and Greece, gained territory, and new nation-states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman and Russian Empires."
"The organisation's primary goals were to prevent armed conflict through collective security, military and naval disarmament, and settling international disputes through peaceful negotiations and arbitration."
"Despite strong pacifist sentiment after World War I, irredentist and revanchist nationalism emerged in several European states in the same period."
"These sentiments were especially marked in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles."
The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the right and left.
"Adolf Hitler, after an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government in 1923, eventually became the Chancellor of Germany in 1933."
"He abolished democracy, espousing a radical, racially motivated revision of the world order, and soon began a massive rearmament campaign."
"Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia, which Italy desired as a colonial possession."
"The Soviet Union, concerned by Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of Eastern Europe, drafted a treaty of mutual assistance with France."
"A month later, Germany and Japan signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Italy joined the following year."
Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being condemned for its incursion into Manchuria.
"Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in Manchuria, and Chahar and Suiyuan."
"The war began with the invasion of the Ethiopian Empire (also known as Abyssinia) by the armed forces of the Kingdom of Italy (Regno d'Italia), which was launched from Italian Somaliland and Eritrea."
"The war resulted in the military occupation of Ethiopia and its annexation into the newly created colony of Italian East Africa (Africa Orientale Italiana, or AOI); in addition it exposed the weakness of the League of Nations as a force to preserve peace."
"Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did little when the former clearly violated Article X of the League's Covenant."
"The United Kingdom and France supported imposing sanctions on Italy for the invasion, but the sanctions were not fully enforced and failed to end the Italian invasion."
Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing Austria.
"Italy supported the Nationalists to a greater extent than the Nazis did: altogether Mussolini sent to Spain more than 70,000 ground troops and 6,000 aviation personnel, as well as about 720 aircraft."
The Soviet Union supported the existing government of the Spanish Republic.
Both Germany and the Soviet Union used this proxy war as an opportunity to test in combat their most advanced weapons and tactics.
His greatest collaboration with Germany was the sending of volunteers to fight on the Eastern Front.
"The Soviets quickly signed a non-aggression pact with China to lend materiel support, effectively ending China's prior co-operation with Germany."
"From September to November, the Japanese attacked Taiyuan, engaged the Kuomintang Army around Xinkou, and fought Communist forces in Pingxingguan."
"Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to defend Shanghai, but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell."
"Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve; instead, the Chinese government relocated inland to Chongqing and continued the war."
"The Japanese doctrine of Hokushin-ron, which emphasised Japan's expansion northward, was favoured by the Imperial Army during this time."
"With the Japanese defeat at Khalkin Gol in 1939, the ongoing Second Sino-Japanese War and ally Nazi Germany pursuing neutrality with the Soviets, this policy would prove difficult to maintain."
"In March 1938, Germany annexed Austria, again provoking little response from other European powers."
"Encouraged, Hitler began pressing German claims on the Sudetenland, an area of Czechoslovakia with a predominantly ethnic German population."
"Soon the United Kingdom and France followed the appeasement policy of British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and conceded this territory to Germany in the Munich Agreement, which was made against the wishes of the Czechoslovak government, in exchange for a promise of no further territorial demands."
"In subsequent speeches Hitler attacked British and Jewish ""war-mongers"" and in January 1939 secretly ordered a major build-up of the German navy to challenge British naval supremacy."
"Greatly alarmed and with Hitler making further demands on the Free City of Danzig, the United Kingdom and France guaranteed their support for Polish independence; when Italy conquered Albania in April 1939, the same guarantee was extended to the Kingdoms of Romania and Greece."
"Shortly after the Franco-British pledge to Poland, Germany and Italy formalised their own alliance with the Pact of Steel."
"On 23 August, when tripartite negotiations about a military alliance between France, the United Kingdom and Soviet Union stalled, the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact with Germany."
"This pact had a secret protocol that defined German and Soviet ""spheres of influence"" (western Poland and Lithuania for Germany; eastern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia and Bessarabia for the Soviet Union), and raised the question of continuing Polish independence."
"The pact neutralised the possibility of Soviet opposition to a campaign against Poland and assured that Germany would not have to face the prospect of a two-front war, as it had in World War I."
"The Poles refused to comply with the German demands, and on the night of 30–31 August in a stormy meeting with the British ambassador Nevile Henderson, Ribbentrop declared that Germany considered its claims rejected."
The first German attack of the war came against the Polish defenses at Westerplatte.
"The United Kingdom responded with an ultimatum to Germany to cease military operations, and on 3 September, after the ultimatum was ignored, France and Britain declared war on Germany, followed by Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada."
"The alliance provided no direct military support to Poland, outside of a cautious French probe into the Saarland."
"The Western Allies also began a naval blockade of Germany, which aimed to damage the country's economy and the war effort."
"Germany responded by ordering U-boat warfare against Allied merchant and warships, which would later escalate into the Battle of the Atlantic."
"The Polish counter offensive to the west halted the German advance for several days, but it was outflanked and encircled by the Wehrmacht."
Remnants of the Polish army broke through to besieged Warsaw.
"Despite the military defeat, Poland never surrendered; instead it formed the Polish government-in-exile and a clandestine state apparatus remained in occupied Poland."
"On 6 October, Hitler made a public peace overture to the United Kingdom and France but said that the future of Poland was to be determined exclusively by Germany and the Soviet Union."
"The proposal was rejected, and Hitler ordered an immediate offensive against France, which was postponed until the spring of 1940 due to bad weather."
"The Soviet Union forced the Baltic countries—Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were in the Soviet ""sphere of influence"" under the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact—to sign ""mutual assistance pacts"" that stipulated stationing Soviet troops in these countries."
"Soon after, significant Soviet military contingents were moved there."
Finland refused to sign a similar pact and rejected ceding part of its territory to the Soviet Union.
"The Soviet Union invaded Finland in November 1939, and the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations."
"Meanwhile, Nazi-Soviet political rapprochement and economic co-operation gradually stalled, and both states began preparations for war."
"Denmark capitulated after a few hours, and Norway was conquered within two months despite Allied support."
"To circumvent the strong Maginot Line fortifications on the Franco-German border, Germany directed its attack at the neutral nations of Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg."
"The Germans carried out a flanking manoeuvre through the Ardennes region, which was mistakenly perceived by Allies as an impenetrable natural barrier against armoured vehicles."
"By successfully implementing new blitzkrieg tactics, the Wehrmacht rapidly advanced to the Channel and cut off the Allied forces in Belgium, trapping the bulk of the Allied armies in a cauldron on the Franco-Belgian border near Lille."
"The Germans turned south against the weakened French army, and Paris fell to them on 14 June."
"Eight days later France signed an armistice with Germany; it was divided into German and Italian occupation zones, and an unoccupied rump state under the Vichy Regime, which, though officially neutral, was generally aligned with Germany."
"France kept its fleet, which the United Kingdom attacked on 3 July in an attempt to prevent its seizure by Germany."
The air Battle of Britain began in early July with Luftwaffe attacks on shipping and harbours.
"The United Kingdom rejected Hitler's peace offer, and the German air superiority campaign started in August but failed to defeat RAF Fighter Command, forcing the indefinite postponement of the proposed German invasion of Britain."
In September the United States further agreed to a trade of American destroyers for British bases.
"Still, a large majority of the American public continued to oppose any direct military intervention in the conflict well into 1941."
"In December 1940 Roosevelt accused Hitler of planning world conquest and ruled out any negotiations as useless, calling for the United States to become an ""arsenal of democracy"" and promoting Lend-Lease programmes of aid to support the British war effort."
"The Tripartite Pact stipulated that any country, with the exception of the Soviet Union, which attacked any Axis Power would be forced to go to war against all three."
"Romania and Hungary later made major contributions to the Axis war against the Soviet Union, in Romania's case partially to recapture territory ceded to the Soviet Union."
"From late summer to early autumn, Italy conquered British Somaliland and made an incursion into British-held Egypt."
"In October, Italy attacked Greece, but the attack was repulsed with heavy Italian casualties; the campaign ended within months with minor territorial changes."
"The Italian Navy also suffered significant defeats, with the Royal Navy putting three Italian battleships out of commission by means of a carrier attack at Taranto, and neutralising several more warships at the Battle of Cape Matapan."
"Italian defeats prompted Germany to deploy an expeditionary force to North Africa and at the end of March 1941, Rommel's Afrika Korps launched an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces."
"Germany responded with simultaneous invasions of both Yugoslavia and Greece, commencing on 6 April 1941; both nations were forced to surrender within the month."
The airborne invasion of the Greek island of Crete at the end of May completed the German conquest of the Balkans.
"Between June and July, they invaded and occupied the French possessions Syria and Lebanon, with the assistance of the Free French."
"With the Soviets wary of mounting tensions with Germany and the Japanese planning to take advantage of the European War by seizing resource-rich European possessions in Southeast Asia, the two powers signed the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact in April 1941."
"He, therefore, decided to try to strengthen Germany's relations with the Soviets or failing that to attack and eliminate them as a factor."
"The Soviets showed some interest but asked for concessions from Finland, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Japan that Germany considered unacceptable."
They were joined shortly by Finland and Hungary.
"The primary targets of this surprise offensive were the Baltic region, Moscow and Ukraine, with the ultimate goal of ending the 1941 campaign near the Arkhangelsk-Astrakhan line, from the Caspian to the White Seas."
"During the summer, the Axis made significant gains into Soviet territory, inflicting immense losses in both personnel and materiel."
"By mid-August, however, the German Army High Command decided to suspend the offensive of a considerably depleted Army Group Centre, and to divert the 2nd Panzer Group to reinforce troops advancing towards central Ukraine and Leningrad."
"The Kiev offensive was overwhelmingly successful, resulting in encirclement and elimination of four Soviet armies, and made possible further advance into Crimea and industrially developed Eastern Ukraine (the First Battle of Kharkov)."
The diversion of three quarters of the Axis troops and the majority of their air forces from France and the central Mediterranean to the Eastern Front prompted the United Kingdom to reconsider its grand strategy.
"In July, the UK and the Soviet Union formed a military alliance against Germany and in August, the United Kingdom and the United States jointly issued the Atlantic Charter, which outlined British and American goals for the postwar world."
"A major offensive against Moscow was renewed; after two months of fierce battles in increasingly harsh weather, the German army almost reached the outer suburbs of Moscow, where the exhausted troops were forced to suspend their offensive."
"Large territorial gains were made by Axis forces, but their campaign had failed to achieve its main objectives: two key cities remained in Soviet hands, the Soviet capability to resist was not broken, and the Soviet Union retained a considerable part of its military potential."
"This, as well as intelligence data which established that a minimal number of Soviet troops in the East would be sufficient to deter any attack by the Japanese Kwantung Army, allowed the Soviets to begin a massive counter-offensive that started on 5 December all along the front and pushed German troops 100–250 kilometres (62–155 mi) west."
"During 1939 Japan launched its first attack against Changsha, a strategically important Chinese city, but was repulsed by late September."
"To increase pressure on China by blocking supply routes, and to better position Japanese forces in the event of a war with the Western powers, Japan invaded and occupied northern Indochina in September 1940."
"In August, Chinese communists launched an offensive in Central China; in retaliation, Japan instituted harsh measures in occupied areas to reduce human and material resources for the communists."
"The continued antipathy between Chinese communist and nationalist forces culminated in armed clashes in January 1941, effectively ending their co-operation."
"The Dutch government agreed to provide Japan with some oil supplies from the Dutch East Indies, but negotiations for additional access to their resources ended in failure in June 1941."
"In July 1941 Japan sent troops to southern Indochina, thus threatening British and Dutch possessions in the Far East."
"The United States, the United Kingdom, and other Western governments reacted to this move with a freeze on Japanese assets and a total oil embargo."
"During these negotiations, Japan advanced a number of proposals which were dismissed by the Americans as inadequate."
"At the same time the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands engaged in secret discussions for the joint defence of their territories, in the event of a Japanese attack against any of them."
"Roosevelt reinforced the Philippines (an American protectorate scheduled for independence in 1946) and warned Japan that the United States would react to Japanese attacks against any ""neighboring countries""."
"Frustrated at the lack of progress and feeling the pinch of the American–British–Dutch sanctions, Japan prepared for war."
It called for the end of American aid to China and for lifting the embargo on the supply of oil and other resources to Japan.
"In exchange, Japan promised not to launch any attacks in Southeast Asia and to withdraw its forces from southern Indochina."
The American counter-proposal of 26 November required that Japan evacuate all of China without conditions and conclude non-aggression pacts with all Pacific powers.
The Japanese would then be free to exploit the resources of Southeast Asia while exhausting the over-stretched Allies by fighting a defensive war.
"To prevent American intervention while securing the perimeter, it was further planned to neutralise the United States Pacific Fleet and the American military presence in the Philippines from the outset."
"Germany, followed by the other Axis states, declared war on the United States in solidarity with Japan, citing as justification the American attacks on German war vessels that had been ordered by Roosevelt."
All agreed that defeating Germany was the primary objective.
"The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France."
The Soviets were also demanding a second front.
"The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces."
Germany itself would be subject to a heavy bombing campaign.
An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies.
The British and Americans agreed to continue to press the initiative in the Mediterranean by invading Sicily to fully secure the Mediterranean supply routes.
"Although the British argued for further operations in the Balkans to bring Turkey into the war, in May 1943, the Americans extracted a British commitment to limit Allied operations in the Mediterranean to an invasion of the Italian mainland and to invade France in 1944."
"Despite stubborn resistance by Filipino and US forces, the Philippine Commonwealth was eventually captured in May 1942, forcing its government into exile."
"Japanese forces also achieved naval victories in the South China Sea, Java Sea and Indian Ocean, and bombed the Allied naval base at Darwin, Australia."
"The planned invasion was thwarted when an Allied task force, centred on two American fleet carriers, fought Japanese naval forces to a draw in the Battle of the Coral Sea."
"Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier Doolittle Raid, was to seize Midway Atoll and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to occupy the Aleutian Islands in Alaska."
"In early June, Japan put its operations into action, but the Americans, having broken Japanese naval codes in late May, were fully aware of the plans and order of battle, and used this knowledge to achieve a decisive victory at Midway over the Imperial Japanese Navy."
"With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture Port Moresby by an overland campaign in the Territory of Papua."
Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.
"In Burma, Commonwealth forces mounted two operations."
"The second was the insertion of irregular forces behind Japanese front-lines in February which, by the end of April, had achieved mixed results."
"In May the Germans defeated Soviet offensives in the Kerch Peninsula and at Kharkov, and then launched their main summer offensive against southern Russia in June 1942, to seize the oil fields of the Caucasus and occupy the Kuban steppe, while maintaining positions on the northern and central areas of the front."
"The Germans split Army Group South into two groups: Army Group A advanced to the lower Don River and struck south-east to the Caucasus, while Army Group B headed towards the Volga River."
"The Soviets began their second winter counter-offensive, starting with an encirclement of German forces at Stalingrad, and an assault on the Rzhev salient near Moscow, though the latter failed disastrously."
"In mid-February, after the Soviet push had tapered off, the Germans launched another attack on Kharkov, creating a salient in their front line around the Soviet city of Kursk."
"In North Africa, the Germans launched an offensive in January, pushing the British back to positions at the Gazala line by early February, followed by a temporary lull in combat which Germany used to prepare for their upcoming offensives."
Concerns the Japanese might use bases in Vichy-held Madagascar caused the British to invade the island in early May 1942.
An Axis offensive in Libya forced an Allied retreat deep inside Egypt until Axis forces were stopped at El Alamein.
"A few months later, the Allies commenced an attack of their own in Egypt, dislodging the Axis forces and beginning a drive west across Libya."
"This attack was followed up shortly after by Anglo-American landings in French North Africa, which resulted in the region joining the Allies."
"Hitler responded to the French colony's defection by ordering the occupation of Vichy France; although Vichy forces did not resist this violation of the armistice, they managed to scuttle their fleet to prevent its capture by German forces."
"The firebombing of Hamburg was among the first attacks in this campaign, inflicting significant casualties and considerable losses on infrastructure of this important industrial centre."
"Soon after, the United States, with support from Australia, New Zealand and Pacific Islander forces, began major ground, sea and air operations to isolate Rabaul by capturing surrounding islands, and breach the Japanese Central Pacific perimeter at the Gilbert and Marshall Islands."
"Within a week, German forces had exhausted themselves against the Soviets' deeply echeloned and well-constructed defences, and for the first time in the war Hitler cancelled the operation before it had achieved tactical or operational success."
"This decision was partially affected by the Western Allies' invasion of Sicily launched on 9 July, which, combined with previous Italian failures, resulted in the ousting and arrest of Mussolini later that month."
"The Soviet victory at Kursk marked the end of German superiority, giving the Soviet Union the initiative on the Eastern Front."
"Germany with the help of fascists responded by disarming Italian forces that were in many places without superior orders, seizing military control of Italian areas, and creating a series of defensive lines."
"German special forces then rescued Mussolini, who then soon established a new client state in German-occupied Italy named the Italian Social Republic, causing an Italian civil war."
"The former conference determined the post-war return of Japanese territory and the military planning for the Burma campaign, while the latter included agreement that the Western Allies would invade Europe in 1944 and that the Soviet Union would declare war on Japan within three months of Germany's defeat."
The following Soviet offensive was halted on the pre-war Estonian border by the German Army Group North aided by Estonians hoping to re-establish national independence.
This delay slowed subsequent Soviet operations in the Baltic Sea region.
"By June, the Japanese had conquered the province of Henan and begun a new attack on Changsha."
"After reassigning several Allied divisions from Italy, they also attacked southern France."
These landings were successful and led to the defeat of the German Army units in France.
An attempt to advance into northern Germany spearheaded by a major airborne operation in the Netherlands failed.
"After that, the Western Allies slowly pushed into Germany, but failed to cross the Rur river in a large offensive."
"In Italy, Allied advance also slowed due to the last major German defensive line."
"Soon after that, another Soviet strategic offensive forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland."
The Soviets formed the Polish Committee of National Liberation to control territory in Poland and combat the Polish Armia Krajowa; The Soviet Red Army remained in the Praga district on the other side of the Vistula and watched passively as the Germans quelled the Warsaw Uprising initiated by the Armia Krajowa.
The national uprising in Slovakia was also quelled by the Germans.
"By this point, the Communist-led Partisans under Marshal Josip Broz Tito, who had led an increasingly successful guerrilla campaign against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and engaged in delaying efforts against German forces further south."
"In northern Serbia, the Soviet Red Army, with limited support from Bulgarian forces, assisted the Partisans in a joint liberation of the capital city of Belgrade on 20 October."
"A few days later, the Soviets launched a massive assault against German-occupied Hungary that lasted until the fall of Budapest in February 1945."
"Unlike impressive Soviet victories in the Balkans, bitter Finnish resistance to the Soviet offensive in the Karelian Isthmus denied the Soviets occupation of Finland and led to a Soviet-Finnish armistice on relatively mild conditions, although Finland was forced to fight their former ally Germany."
"In China, the Japanese had more successes, having finally captured Changsha in mid-June and the city of Hengyang by early August."
"These defeats led to the resignation of the Japanese Prime Minister, Hideki Tojo, and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands."
"In late October, American forces invaded the Filipino island of Leyte; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory in the Battle of Leyte Gulf, one of the largest naval battles in history."
"By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled."
"In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line."
"In mid-January 1945, the Soviets and Poles attacked in Poland, pushing from the Vistula to the Oder river in Germany, and overran East Prussia."
"On 4 February Soviet, British, and US leaders met for the Yalta Conference."
"By March, the Western Allies crossed the Rhine north and south of the Ruhr, encircling the German Army Group B."
"In early March, in an attempt to protect its last oil reserves in Hungary and to retake Budapest, Germany launched its last major offensive against Soviet troops near Lake Balaton."
"In two weeks, the offensive had been repulsed, the Soviets advanced to Vienna, and captured the city."
Soviet and Polish forces stormed and captured Berlin in late April.
"On 30 April, the Reichstag was captured, signalling the military defeat of Nazi Germany, Berlin garrison surrendered on 2 May."
Several changes in leadership occurred during this period.
"Fighting continued on Luzon, Mindanao, and other islands of the Philippines until the end of the war."
"Meanwhile, the United States Army Air Forces launched a massive firebombing campaign of strategic cities in Japan in an effort to destroy Japanese war industry and civilian morale."
"American naval and amphibious forces also moved towards Japan, taking Iwo Jima by March, and Okinawa by the end of June."
"They confirmed earlier agreements about Germany, and the American, British and Chinese governments reiterated the demand for unconditional surrender of Japan, specifically stating that ""the alternative for Japan is prompt and utter destruction""."
"In early August, the United States dropped atomic bombs on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki."
"Between the two bombings, the Soviets, pursuant to the Yalta agreement, invaded Japanese-held Manchuria and quickly defeated the Kwantung Army, which was the largest Japanese fighting force."
These two events persuaded previously adamant Imperial Army leaders to accept surrender terms.
The Red Army also captured the southern part of Sakhalin Island and the Kuril Islands.
"The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc."
The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the Soviet Union.
"By the 1950s, one-fifth of West Germans were refugees from the east."
"The Soviet Union also took over the Polish provinces east of the Curzon line, from which 2 million Poles were expelled; north-east Romania, parts of eastern Finland, and the three Baltic states were incorporated into the Soviet Union."
"In an effort to maintain world peace, the Allies formed the United Nations, which officially came into existence on 24 October 1945, and adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948 as a common standard for all member nations."
"The great powers that were the victors of the war—France, China, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union and the United States—became the permanent members of the UN's Security Council."
"The five permanent members remain so to the present, although there have been two seat changes, between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China in 1971, and between the Soviet Union and its successor state, the Russian Federation, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991."
The alliance between the Western Allies and the Soviet Union had begun to deteriorate even before the war was over.
"Germany had been de facto divided, and two independent states, the Federal Republic of Germany (West Germany) and the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), were created within the borders of Allied and Soviet occupation zones."
The rest of Europe was also divided into Western and Soviet spheres of influence.
"Most eastern and central European countries fell into the Soviet sphere, which led to establishment of Communist-led regimes, with full or partial support of the Soviet occupation authorities."
"As a result, East Germany, Poland, Hungary, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Albania became Soviet satellite states."
"Korea, formerly under Japanese rule, was divided and occupied by the Soviet Union in the North and the United States in the South between 1945 and 1948."
"Communist forces were victorious and established the People's Republic of China on the mainland, while nationalist forces retreated to Taiwan in 1949."
"In the Middle East, the Arab rejection of the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine and the creation of Israel marked the escalation of the Arab–Israeli conflict."
"The United States emerged much richer than any other nation, leading to a baby boom, and by 1950 its gross domestic product per person was much higher than that of any of the other powers, and it dominated the world economy."
The UK and US pursued a policy of industrial disarmament in Western Germany in the years 1945–1948.
Italy also experienced an economic boom and the French economy rebounded.
"Many of the civilians died because of deliberate genocide, massacres, mass bombings, disease, and starvation."
A quarter of the people in the Soviet Union were wounded or killed.
"The most infamous Japanese atrocity was the Nanking Massacre, in which fifty to three hundred thousand Chinese civilians were raped and murdered."
The Imperial Japanese Army used a variety of such weapons during its invasion and occupation of China (see Unit 731) and in early conflicts against the Soviets.
"In addition to concentration camps, death camps were created in Nazi Germany to exterminate people on an industrial scale."
"By the end of the war, most Soviet POWs liberated from Nazi camps and many repatriated civilians were detained in special filtration camps where they were subjected to NKVD evaluation, and 226,127 were sent to the Gulag as real or perceived Nazi collaborators."
"Japanese prisoner-of-war camps, many of which were used as labour camps, also had high death rates."
"The International Military Tribunal for the Far East found the death rate of Western prisoners was 27 per cent (for American POWs, 37 per cent), seven times that of POWs under the Germans and Italians."
"Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on."
"In the East, the intended gains of Lebensraum were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet scorched earth policies denied resources to the German invaders."
"Unlike in the West, the Nazi racial policy encouraged extreme brutality against what it considered to be the ""inferior people"" of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by mass executions."
"Although resistance groups formed in most occupied territories, they did not significantly hamper German operations in either the East or the West until late 1943."
"In Asia, Japan termed nations under its occupation as being part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, essentially a Japanese hegemony which it claimed was for purposes of liberating colonised peoples."
"Although Japanese forces were sometimes welcomed as liberators from European domination, Japanese war crimes frequently turned local public opinion against them."
"In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and the British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis powers (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, the Allies had more than a 5:1 advantage in population and a nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP."
"Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition."
"While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the labour force, Allied strategic bombing, and Germany's late shift to a war economy contributed significantly."
"Additionally, neither Germany nor Japan planned to fight a protracted war, and had not equipped themselves to do so."
"To improve their production, Germany and Japan used millions of slave labourers; Germany used about 12 million people, mostly from Eastern Europe, while Japan used more than 18 million people in Far East Asia."
"Innovation included airlift (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment, and personnel); and of strategic bombing (the bombing of enemy industrial and population centres to destroy the enemy's ability to wage war)."
"Anti-aircraft weaponry also advanced, including defences such as radar and surface-to-air artillery."
"The use of the jet aircraft was pioneered and, though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in air forces worldwide."
"Although guided missiles were being developed, they were not advanced enough to reliably target aircraft until some years after the war."
"Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines."
"Although aeronautical warfare had relatively little success at the start of the war, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship."
"In the Atlantic, escort carriers proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the Mid-Atlantic gap."
Carriers were also more economical than battleships because of the relatively low cost of aircraft and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.
"Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War, were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second."
"The British focused development on anti-submarine weaponry and tactics, such as sonar and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the Type VII submarine and wolfpack tactics."
"Land warfare changed from the static front lines of trench warfare of World War I, which had relied on improved artillery that outmatched the speed of both infantry and cavalry, to increased mobility and combined arms."
"The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon."
"At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications."
"This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat."
"This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France."
"Many means of destroying tanks, including indirect artillery, anti-tank guns (both towed and self-propelled), mines, short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were used."
"Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces, and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I."
"The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German MG34, and various submachine guns which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings."
"The assault rifle, a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces."
"Most major belligerents attempted to solve the problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine."
Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of decryption.
"Notable examples were the Allied decryption of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to the United Kingdom by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war."
"Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt."
Ancient Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3100 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under Menes (often identified with Narmer).
"The history of ancient Egypt occurred as a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age."
"Egypt reached the pinnacle of its power in the New Kingdom, ruling much of Nubia and a sizable portion of the Near East, after which it entered a period of slow decline."
"During the course of its history Egypt was invaded or conquered by a number of foreign powers, including the Hyksos, the Libyans, the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Achaemenid Persians, and the Macedonians under the command of Alexander the Great."
"The predictable flooding and controlled irrigation of the fertile valley produced surplus crops, which supported a more dense population, and social development and culture."
"With resources to spare, the administration sponsored mineral exploitation of the valley and surrounding desert regions, the early development of an independent writing system, the organization of collective construction and agricultural projects, trade with surrounding regions, and a military intended to assert Egyptian dominance."
Ancient Egypt has left a lasting legacy.
"Its art and architecture were widely copied, and its antiquities carried off to far corners of the world."
Its monumental ruins have inspired the imaginations of travelers and writers for millennia.
A newfound respect for antiquities and excavations in the early modern period by Europeans and Egyptians led to the scientific investigation of Egyptian civilization and a greater appreciation of its cultural legacy.
"The fertile floodplain of the Nile gave humans the opportunity to develop a settled agricultural economy and a more sophisticated, centralized society that became a cornerstone in the history of human civilization."
"Nomadic modern human hunter-gatherers began living in the Nile valley through the end of the Middle Pleistocene some 120,000 years ago."
"By the late Paleolithic period, the arid climate of Northern Africa became increasingly hot and dry, forcing the populations of the area to concentrate along the river region."
Large regions of Egypt were covered in treed savanna and traversed by herds of grazing ungulates.
Foliage and fauna were far more prolific in all environs and the Nile region supported large populations of waterfowl.
"The largest of these early cultures in upper (Southern) Egypt was the Badarian culture, which probably originated in the Western Desert; it was known for its high-quality ceramics, stone tools, and its use of copper."
"The Badari was followed by the Naqada culture: the Amratian (Naqada I), the Gerzeh (Naqada II), and Semainean (Naqada III)."
These brought a number of technological improvements.
"As early as the Naqada I Period, predynastic Egyptians imported obsidian from Ethiopia, used to shape blades and other objects from flakes."
"In Naqada II times, early evidence exists of contact with the Near East, particularly Canaan and the Byblos coast."
"Over a period of about 1,000 years, the Naqada culture developed from a few small farming communities into a powerful civilization whose leaders were in complete control of the people and resources of the Nile valley."
"Establishing a power center at Nekhen (in Greek, Hierakonpolis), and later at Abydos, Naqada III leaders expanded their control of Egypt northwards along the Nile."
"They also developed a ceramic glaze known as faience, which was used well into the Roman Period to decorate cups, amulets, and figurines."
"During the last predynastic phase, the Naqada culture began using written symbols that eventually were developed into a full system of hieroglyphs for writing the ancient Egyptian language."
"The third-century BC Egyptian priest Manetho grouped the long line of kings from Menes to his own time into 30 dynasties, a system still used today."
"He began his official history with the king named ""Meni"" (or Menes in Greek) who was believed to have united the two kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt."
"The transition to a unified state happened more gradually than ancient Egyptian writers represented, and there is no contemporary record of Menes."
"Some scholars now believe, however, that the mythical Menes may have been the king Narmer, who is depicted wearing royal regalia on the ceremonial Narmer Palette, in a symbolic act of unification."
"In the Early Dynastic Period, which began about 3000 BC, the first of the Dynastic kings solidified control over lower Egypt by establishing a capital at Memphis, from which he could control the labour force and agriculture of the fertile delta region, as well as the lucrative and critical trade routes to the Levant."
"The increasing power and wealth of the kings during the early dynastic period was reflected in their elaborate mastaba tombs and mortuary cult structures at Abydos, which were used to celebrate the deified king after his death."
"The strong institution of kingship developed by the kings served to legitimize state control over the land, labour, and resources that were essential to the survival and growth of ancient Egyptian civilization."
"Some of ancient Egypt's crowning achievements, the Giza pyramids and Great Sphinx, were constructed during the Old Kingdom."
"Under the direction of the vizier, state officials collected taxes, coordinated irrigation projects to improve crop yield, drafted peasants to work on construction projects, and established a justice system to maintain peace and order."
"With the rising importance of central administration in Egypt, a new class of educated scribes and officials arose who were granted estates by the king in payment for their services."
"Kings also made land grants to their mortuary cults and local temples, to ensure that these institutions had the resources to worship the king after his death."
"Scholars believe that five centuries of these practices slowly eroded the economic vitality of Egypt, and that the economy could no longer afford to support a large centralized administration."
"As the power of the kings diminished, regional governors called nomarchs began to challenge the supremacy of the office of king."
"This, coupled with severe droughts between 2200 and 2150 BC, is believed to have caused the country to enter the 140-year period of famine and strife known as the First Intermediate Period."
"Regional governors could not rely on the king for help in times of crisis, and the ensuing food shortages and political disputes escalated into famines and small-scale civil wars."
"Yet despite difficult problems, local leaders, owing no tribute to the king, used their new-found independence to establish a thriving culture in the provinces."
"Once in control of their own resources, the provinces became economically richer—which was demonstrated by larger and better burials among all social classes."
"By 2160 BC, rulers in Herakleopolis controlled Lower Egypt in the north, while a rival clan based in Thebes, the Intef family, took control of Upper Egypt in the south."
"As the Intefs grew in power and expanded their control northward, a clash between the two rival dynasties became inevitable."
"Around 2055 BC the northern Theban forces under Nebhepetre Mentuhotep II finally defeated the Herakleopolitan rulers, reuniting the Two Lands."
They inaugurated a period of economic and cultural renaissance known as the Middle Kingdom.
"Mentuhotep II and his Eleventh Dynasty successors ruled from Thebes, but the vizier Amenemhat I, upon assuming the kingship at the beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty around 1985 BC, shifted the kingdom's capital to the city of Itjtawy, located in Faiyum."
"From Itjtawy, the kings of the Twelfth Dynasty undertook a far-sighted land reclamation and irrigation scheme to increase agricultural output in the region."
"In contrast to elitist Old Kingdom attitudes towards the gods, the Middle Kingdom displayed an increase in expressions of personal piety."
"Middle Kingdom literature featured sophisticated themes and characters written in a confident, eloquent style."
"These ambitious building and mining activities, however, combined with severe Nile floods later in his reign, strained the economy and precipitated the slow decline into the Second Intermediate Period during the later Thirteenth and Fourteenth dynasties."
"During this decline, the Canaanite settlers began to assume greater control of the Delta region, eventually coming to power in Egypt as the Hyksos."
The king was treated as a vassal and expected to pay tribute.
"The Hyksos (""foreign rulers"") retained Egyptian models of government and identified as kings, thereby integrating Egyptian elements into their culture."
"After years of vassalage, Thebes gathered enough strength to challenge the Hyksos in a conflict that lasted more than 30 years, until 1555 BC."
"The kings Seqenenre Tao II and Kamose were ultimately able to defeat the Nubians to the south of Egypt, but failed to defeat the Hyksos."
"That task fell to Kamose's successor, Ahmose I, who successfully waged a series of campaigns that permanently eradicated the Hyksos' presence in Egypt."
"He established a new dynasty and, in the New Kingdom that followed, the military became a central priority for the kings, who sought to expand Egypt's borders and attempted to gain mastery of the Near East."
Military campaigns waged under Tuthmosis I and his grandson Tuthmosis III extended the influence of the pharaohs to the largest empire Egypt had ever seen.
Beginning with Merneptah the rulers of Egypt adopted the title of pharaoh.
"Between their reigns, Hatshepsut, a queen who established herself as pharaoh, launched many building projects, including restoration of temples damaged by the Hyksos, and sent trading expeditions to Punt and the Sinai."
"They also constructed monuments to glorify their own achievements, both real and imagined."
"Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and moved the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna)."
He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style.
"After his death, the cult of the Aten was quickly abandoned and the traditional religious order restored."
"The subsequent pharaohs, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb, worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period."
"Around 1279 BC, Ramesses II, also known as Ramesses the Great, ascended the throne, and went on to build more temples, erect more statues and obelisks, and sire more children than any other pharaoh in history."
"Initially, the military was able to repel these invasions, but Egypt eventually lost control of its remaining territories in southern Canaan, much of it falling to the Assyrians."
"The effects of external threats were exacerbated by internal problems such as corruption, tomb robbery, and civil unrest."
"After regaining their power, the high priests at the temple of Amun in Thebes accumulated vast tracts of land and wealth, and their expanded power splintered the country during the Third Intermediate Period."
"The south was effectively controlled by the High Priests of Amun at Thebes, who recognized Smendes in name only."
"During this time, Libyans had been settling in the western delta, and chieftains of these settlers began increasing their autonomy."
"Libyan princes took control of the delta under Shoshenq I in 945 BC, founding the so-called Libyan or Bubastite dynasty that would rule for some 200 years."
Shoshenq also gained control of southern Egypt by placing his family members in important priestly positions.
"Libyan control began to erode as a rival dynasty in the delta arose in Leontopolis, and Kushites threatened from the south."
"Around 727 BC the Kushite king Piye invaded northward, seizing control of Thebes and eventually the Delta, which established the 25th Dynasty."
"During the 25th Dynasty, Pharaoh Taharqa created an empire nearly as large as the New Kingdom's."
"Twenty-fifth Dynasty pharaohs built, or restored, temples and monuments throughout the Nile valley, including at Memphis, Karnak, Kawa, and Jebel Barkal."
"During this period, the Nile valley saw the first widespread construction of pyramids (many in modern Sudan) since the Middle Kingdom."
Egypt's far-reaching prestige declined considerably toward the end of the Third Intermediate Period.
"Its foreign allies had fallen under the Assyrian sphere of influence, and by 700 BC war between the two states became inevitable."
Between 671 and 667 BC the Assyrians began the Assyrian conquest of Egypt.
"The reigns of both Taharqa and his successor, Tanutamun, were filled with constant conflict with the Assyrians, against whom Egypt enjoyed several victories."
"Ultimately, the Assyrians pushed the Kushites back into Nubia, occupied Memphis, and sacked the temples of Thebes."
"By 653 BC, the Saite king Psamtik I was able to oust the Assyrians with the help of Greek mercenaries, who were recruited to form Egypt's first navy."
Greek influence expanded greatly as the city-state of Naukratis became the home of Greeks in the Nile Delta.
"The Saite kings based in the new capital of Sais witnessed a brief but spirited resurgence in the economy and culture, but in 525 BC, the powerful Persians, led by Cambyses II, began their conquest of Egypt, eventually capturing the pharaoh Psamtik III at the Battle of Pelusium."
"Cambyses II then assumed the formal title of pharaoh, but ruled Egypt from Iran, leaving Egypt under the control of a satrapy."
"This first period of Persian rule over Egypt, also known as the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty, ended in 402 BC, when Egypt regained independence under a series of native dynasties."
"The last of these dynasties, the Thirtieth, proved to be the last native royal house of ancient Egypt, ending with the kingship of Nectanebo II."
"A brief restoration of Persian rule, sometimes known as the Thirty-First Dynasty, began in 343 BC, but shortly after, in 332 BC, the Persian ruler Mazaces handed Egypt over to Alexander the Great without a fight."
"The administration established by Alexander's successors, the Macedonian Ptolemaic Kingdom, was based on an Egyptian model and based in the new capital city of Alexandria."
"The city showcased the power and prestige of Hellenistic rule, and became a seat of learning and culture, centered at the famous Library of Alexandria."
"They built new temples in Egyptian style, supported traditional cults, and portrayed themselves as pharaohs."
"Some traditions merged, as Greek and Egyptian gods were syncretized into composite deities, such as Serapis, and classical Greek forms of sculpture influenced traditional Egyptian motifs."
"Despite their efforts to appease the Egyptians, the Ptolemies were challenged by native rebellion, bitter family rivalries, and the powerful mob of Alexandria that formed after the death of Ptolemy IV."
"In addition, as Rome relied more heavily on imports of grain from Egypt, the Romans took great interest in the political situation in the country."
"Continued Egyptian revolts, ambitious politicians, and powerful opponents from the Near East made this situation unstable, leading Rome to send forces to secure the country as a province of its empire."
"Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire in 30 BC, following the defeat of Marc Antony and Ptolemaic Queen Cleopatra VII by Octavian (later Emperor Augustus) in the Battle of Actium."
"The Romans relied heavily on grain shipments from Egypt, and the Roman army, under the control of a prefect appointed by the Emperor, quelled rebellions, strictly enforced the collection of heavy taxes, and prevented attacks by bandits, which had become a notorious problem during the period."
"The art of mummy portraiture flourished, and some Roman emperors had themselves depicted as pharaohs, though not to the extent that the Ptolemies had."
The former lived outside Egypt and did not perform the ceremonial functions of Egyptian kingship.
"However, it was an uncompromising religion that sought to win converts from Egyptian Religion and Greco-Roman religion and threatened popular religious traditions."
"This led to the persecution of converts to Christianity, culminating in the great purges of Diocletian starting in 303, but eventually Christianity won out."
In 391 the Christian Emperor Theodosius introduced legislation that banned pagan rites and closed temples.
Alexandria became the scene of great anti-pagan riots with public and private religious imagery destroyed.
"As a consequence, Egypt's native religious culture was continually in decline."
"While the native population continued to speak their language, the ability to read hieroglyphic writing slowly disappeared as the role of the Egyptian temple priests and priestesses diminished."
"In the waning years of the Empire, Egypt fell to the Sasanian Persian army in the Sasanian conquest of Egypt (618–628)."
"It was then recaptured by the Roman Emperor Heraclius (629–639), and was finally captured by Muslim Rashidun army in 639–641, ending Roman rule."
"The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs."
"In charge of the administration was his second in command, the vizier, who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives."
"At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction."
The temples formed the backbone of the economy.
"Although the ancient Egyptians did not use coinage until the Late period, they did use a type of money-barter system, with standard sacks of grain and the deben, a weight of roughly 91 grams (3 oz) of copper or silver, forming a common denominator."
"Prices were fixed across the country and recorded in lists to facilitate trading; for example a shirt cost five copper deben, while a cow cost 140 deben."
"Grain could be traded for other goods, according to the fixed price list."
During the fifth century BC coined money was introduced into Egypt from abroad.
"At first the coins were used as standardized pieces of precious metal rather than true money, but in the following centuries international traders came to rely on coinage."
"Farmers made up the bulk of the population, but agricultural produce was owned directly by the state, temple, or noble family that owned the land."
Farmers were also subject to a labor tax and were required to work on irrigation or construction projects in a corvée system.
"Artists and craftsmen were of higher status than farmers, but they were also under state control, working in the shops attached to the temples and paid directly from the state treasury."
"Scribes and officials formed the upper class in ancient Egypt, known as the ""white kilt class"" in reference to the bleached linen garments that served as a mark of their rank."
The upper class prominently displayed their social status in art and literature.
"Below the nobility were the priests, physicians, and engineers with specialized training in their field."
"It is unclear whether slavery as understood today existed in ancient Egypt, there is difference of opinions among authors."
"The ancient Egyptians viewed men and women, including people from all social classes, as essentially equal under the law, and even the lowliest peasant was entitled to petition the vizier and his court for redress."
"Although slaves were mostly used as indentured servants, they were able to buy and sell their servitude, work their way to freedom or nobility, and were usually treated by doctors in the workplace."
"Both men and women had the right to own and sell property, make contracts, marry and divorce, receive inheritance, and pursue legal disputes in court."
"Married couples could own property jointly and protect themselves from divorce by agreeing to marriage contracts, which stipulated the financial obligations of the husband to his wife and children should the marriage end."
"Compared with their counterparts in ancient Greece, Rome, and even more modern places around the world, ancient Egyptian women had a greater range of personal choices, legal rights, and opportunities for achievement."
"Women such as Hatshepsut and Cleopatra VII even became pharaohs, while others wielded power as Divine Wives of Amun."
"Despite these freedoms, ancient Egyptian women did not often take part in official roles in the administration, aside from the royal high priestesses, apparently served only secondary roles in the temples (not much data for many dynasties), and were not so likely to be as educated as men."
"Although no legal codes from ancient Egypt survive, court documents show that Egyptian law was based on a common-sense view of right and wrong that emphasized reaching agreements and resolving conflicts rather than strictly adhering to a complicated set of statutes."
"Local councils of elders, known as Kenbet in the New Kingdom, were responsible for ruling in court cases involving small claims and minor disputes."
"More serious cases involving murder, major land transactions, and tomb robbery were referred to the Great Kenbet, over which the vizier or pharaoh presided."
Plaintiffs and defendants were expected to represent themselves and were required to swear an oath that they had told the truth.
"In some cases, the state took on both the role of prosecutor and judge, and it could torture the accused with beatings to obtain a confession and the names of any co-conspirators."
"Serious crimes such as murder and tomb robbery were punished by execution, carried out by decapitation, drowning, or impaling the criminal on a stake."
Punishment could also be extended to the criminal's family.
"Beginning in the New Kingdom, oracles played a major role in the legal system, dispensing justice in both civil and criminal cases."
"The procedure was to ask the god a ""yes"" or ""no"" question concerning the right or wrong of an issue."
"The god, carried by a number of priests, rendered judgement by choosing one or the other, moving forward or backward, or pointing to one of the answers written on a piece of papyrus or an ostracon."
"The ancient Egyptians were thus able to produce an abundance of food, allowing the population to devote more time and resources to cultural, technological, and artistic pursuits."
"The Egyptians recognized three seasons: Akhet (flooding), Peret (planting), and Shemu (harvesting)."
"The flooding season lasted from June to September, depositing on the river's banks a layer of mineral-rich silt ideal for growing crops."
"After the floodwaters had receded, the growing season lasted from October to February."
"Farmers plowed and planted seeds in the fields, which were irrigated with ditches and canals."
"Egypt received little rainfall, so farmers relied on the Nile to water their crops."
"From March to May, farmers used sickles to harvest their crops, which were then threshed with a flail to separate the straw from the grain."
"Flax plants, uprooted before they started flowering, were grown for the fibers of their stems."
"These fibers were split along their length and spun into thread, which was used to weave sheets of linen and to make clothing."
Papyrus growing on the banks of the Nile River was used to make paper.
"Vegetables and fruits were grown in garden plots, close to habitations and on higher ground, and had to be watered by hand."
"Vegetables included leeks, garlic, melons, squashes, pulses, lettuce, and other crops, in addition to grapes that were made into wine."
"Animals, both domesticated and wild, were therefore a critical source of spirituality, companionship, and sustenance to the ancient Egyptians."
"Cattle were the most important livestock; the administration collected taxes on livestock in regular censuses, and the size of a herd reflected the prestige and importance of the estate or temple that owned them."
"In addition to cattle, the ancient Egyptians kept sheep, goats, and pigs."
"Poultry, such as ducks, geese, and pigeons, were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them."
The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish.
The slaughter of a fattened ox was also a central part of an offering ritual.
Horses were introduced by the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period.
"Camels, although known from the New Kingdom, were not used as beasts of burden until the Late Period."
There is also evidence to suggest that elephants were briefly utilized in the Late Period but largely abandoned due to lack of grazing land.
"Cats, dogs, and monkeys were common family pets, while more exotic pets imported from the heart of Africa, such as Sub-Saharan African lions, were reserved for royalty."
Herodotus observed that the Egyptians were the only people to keep their animals with them in their houses.
"During the Late Period, the worship of the gods in their animal form was extremely popular, such as the cat goddess Bastet and the ibis god Thoth, and these animals were kept in large numbers for the purpose of ritual sacrifice."
"These natural resources allowed the ancient Egyptians to build monuments, sculpt statues, make tools, and fashion jewelry."
"Embalmers used salts from the Wadi Natrun for mummification, which also provided the gypsum needed to make plaster."
"Ore-bearing rock formations were found in distant, inhospitable wadis in the Eastern Desert and the Sinai, requiring large, state-controlled expeditions to obtain natural resources found there."
"There were extensive gold mines in Nubia, and one of the first maps known is of a gold mine in this region."
"The Wadi Hammamat was a notable source of granite, greywacke, and gold."
"Flint was the first mineral collected and used to make tools, and flint handaxes are the earliest pieces of evidence of habitation in the Nile valley."
Nodules of the mineral were carefully flaked to make blades and arrowheads of moderate hardness and durability even after copper was adopted for this purpose.
Copper was the most important metal for toolmaking in ancient Egypt and was smelted in furnaces from malachite ore mined in the Sinai.
"Workers collected gold by washing the nuggets out of sediment in alluvial deposits, or by the more labor-intensive process of grinding and washing gold-bearing quartzite."
Iron deposits found in upper Egypt were utilized in the Late Period.
"High-quality building stones were abundant in Egypt; the ancient Egyptians quarried limestone all along the Nile valley, granite from Aswan, and basalt and sandstone from the wadis of the Eastern Desert."
"Deposits of decorative stones such as porphyry, greywacke, alabaster, and carnelian dotted the Eastern Desert and were collected even before the First Dynasty."
"In the Ptolemaic and Roman Periods, miners worked deposits of emeralds in Wadi Sikait and amethyst in Wadi el-Hudi."
"In the Predynastic Period, they established trade with Nubia to obtain gold and incense."
"They also established trade with Palestine, as evidenced by Palestinian-style oil jugs found in the burials of the First Dynasty pharaohs."
An Egyptian colony stationed in southern Canaan dates to slightly before the First Dynasty.
"By the Fifth Dynasty, trade with Punt provided gold, aromatic resins, ebony, ivory, and wild animals such as monkeys and baboons."
"Egypt relied on trade with Anatolia for essential quantities of tin as well as supplementary supplies of copper, both metals being necessary for the manufacture of bronze."
"The ancient Egyptians prized the blue stone lapis lazuli, which had to be imported from far-away Afghanistan."
"Egypt's Mediterranean trade partners also included Greece and Crete, which provided, among other goods, supplies of olive oil."
"In exchange for its luxury imports and raw materials, Egypt mainly exported grain, gold, linen, and papyrus, in addition to other finished goods including glass and stone objects."
"The phases of ancient Egyptian are Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian (Classical Egyptian), Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic."
"Late Egyptian developed prefixal definite and indefinite articles, which replaced the older inflectional suffixes."
There was a change from the older verb–subject–object word order to subject–verb–object.
"The Egyptian hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts were eventually replaced by the more phonetic Coptic alphabet."
"Coptic is still used in the liturgy of the Egyptian Orthodox Church, and traces of it are found in modern Egyptian Arabic."
"These include pharyngeal and emphatic consonants, voiced and voiceless stops, voiceless fricatives and voiced and voiceless affricates."
"It has three long and three short vowels, which expanded in Late Egyptian to about nine."
"The basic word in Egyptian, similar to Semitic and Berber, is a triliteral or biliteral root of consonants and semiconsonants."
Suffixes are added to form words.
The verb conjugation corresponds to the person.
"For example, the triconsonantal skeleton S-Ḏ-M is the semantic core of the word 'hear'; its basic conjugation is sḏm, 'he hears'."
"If the subject is a noun, suffixes are not added to the verb: sḏm ḥmt, 'the woman hears'."
Adjectives are derived from nouns through a process that Egyptologists call nisbation because of its similarity with Arabic.
"The word order is predicate–subject in verbal and adjectival sentences, and subject–predicate in nominal and adverbial sentences."
The subject can be moved to the beginning of sentences if it is long and is followed by a resumptive pronoun.
"Verbs and nouns are negated by the particle n, but nn is used for adverbial and adjectival sentences."
"Stress falls on the ultimate or penultimate syllable, which can be open (CV) or closed (CVC)."
"A hieroglyph can represent a word, a sound, or a silent determinative; and the same symbol can serve different purposes in different contexts."
"Hieroglyphs were a formal script, used on stone monuments and in tombs, that could be as detailed as individual works of art."
"In day-to-day writing, scribes used a cursive form of writing, called hieratic, which was quicker and easier."
"While formal hieroglyphs may be read in rows or columns in either direction (though typically written from right to left), hieratic was always written from right to left, usually in horizontal rows."
Coptic is a modified Greek alphabet with the addition of some Demotic signs.
"Although formal hieroglyphs were used in a ceremonial role until the fourth century, towards the end only a small handful of priests could still read them."
"As the traditional religious establishments were disbanded, knowledge of hieroglyphic writing was mostly lost."
"Attempts to decipher them date to the Byzantine and Islamic periods in Egypt, but only in the 1820s, after the discovery of the Rosetta Stone and years of research by Thomas Young and Jean-François Champollion, were hieroglyphs substantially deciphered."
"It was primarily an occupation of the scribes, who worked out of the Per Ankh institution or the House of Life."
"The latter comprised offices, libraries (called House of Books), laboratories and observatories."
"Some of the best-known pieces of ancient Egyptian literature, such as the Pyramid and Coffin Texts, were written in Classical Egyptian, which continued to be the language of writing until about 1300 BC."
"Late Egyptian was spoken from the New Kingdom onward and is represented in Ramesside administrative documents, love poetry and tales, as well as in Demotic and Coptic texts."
"During this period, the tradition of writing had evolved into the tomb autobiography, such as those of Harkhuf and Weni."
"The genre known as Sebayt (""instructions"") was developed to communicate teachings and guidance from famous nobles; the Ipuwer papyrus, a poem of lamentations describing natural disasters and social upheaval, is a famous example."
"The Story of Sinuhe, written in Middle Egyptian, might be the classic of Egyptian literature."
"Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons relating the marvels performed by priests."
The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of Near Eastern literature.
"Towards the end of the New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any."
The former tells the story of a noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of his struggle to return to Egypt.
"From about 700 BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian."
"Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II."
"Their dwellings were restricted to immediate family members, and were constructed of mudbrick designed to remain cool in the heat of the day."
"Each home had a kitchen with an open roof, which contained a grindstone for milling grain and a small oven for baking the bread."
"Ceramics served as household wares for the storage, preparation, transport, and consumption of food, drink, and raw materials."
Walls were painted white and could be covered with dyed linen wall hangings.
"Floors were covered with reed mats, while wooden stools, beds raised from the floor and individual tables comprised the furniture."
The ancient Egyptians placed a great value on hygiene and appearance.
Most bathed in the Nile and used a pasty soap made from animal fat and chalk.
Men shaved their entire bodies for cleanliness; perfumes and aromatic ointments covered bad odors and soothed skin.
"Clothing was made from simple linen sheets that were bleached white, and both men and women of the upper classes wore wigs, jewelry, and cosmetics."
"Children went without clothing until maturity, at about age 12, and at this age males were circumcised and had their heads shaved."
"Early instruments included flutes and harps, while instruments similar to trumpets, oboes, and pipes developed later and became popular."
"In the New Kingdom, the Egyptians played on bells, cymbals, tambourines, drums, and imported lutes and lyres from Asia."
The sistrum was a rattle-like musical instrument that was especially important in religious ceremonies.
"The ancient Egyptians enjoyed a variety of leisure activities, including games and music."
"Senet, a board game where pieces moved according to random chance, was particularly popular from the earliest times; another similar game was mehen, which had a circular gaming board."
“Hounds and Jackals” also known as 58 holes is another example of board games played in ancient Egypt.
The first complete set of this game was discovered from a Theban tomb of the Egyptian pharaoh Amenemhat IV that dates to the 13th Dynasty.
"Juggling and ball games were popular with children, and wrestling is also documented in a tomb at Beni Hasan."
"The wealthy members of ancient Egyptian society enjoyed hunting, fishing, and boating as well."
"The excavation of the workers' village of Deir el-Medina has resulted in one of the most thoroughly documented accounts of community life in the ancient world, which spans almost four hundred years."
"There is no comparable site in which the organization, social interactions, and working and living conditions of a community have been studied in such detail."
"The staple diet consisted of bread and beer, supplemented with vegetables such as onions and garlic, and fruit such as dates and figs."
Wine and meat were enjoyed by all on feast days while the upper classes indulged on a more regular basis.
"Fish, meat, and fowl could be salted or dried, and could be cooked in stews or roasted on a grill."
"Building projects were organized and funded by the state for religious and commemorative purposes, but also to reinforce the wide-ranging power of the pharaoh."
"Peasants lived in simple homes, while the palaces of the elite and the pharaoh were more elaborate structures."
"A few surviving New Kingdom palaces, such as those in Malkata and Amarna, show richly decorated walls and floors with scenes of people, birds, water pools, deities and geometric designs."
Important structures such as temples and tombs that were intended to last forever were constructed of stone instead of mudbricks.
"The architectural elements used in the world's first large-scale stone building, Djoser's mortuary complex, include post and lintel supports in the papyrus and lotus motif."
"The earliest preserved ancient Egyptian temples, such as those at Giza, consist of single, enclosed halls with roof slabs supported by columns."
"In the New Kingdom, architects added the pylon, the open courtyard, and the enclosed hypostyle hall to the front of the temple's sanctuary, a style that was standard until the Greco-Roman period."
"The earliest and most popular tomb architecture in the Old Kingdom was the mastaba, a flat-roofed rectangular structure of mudbrick or stone built over an underground burial chamber."
The step pyramid of Djoser is a series of stone mastabas stacked on top of each other.
"Pyramids were built during the Old and Middle Kingdoms, but most later rulers abandoned them in favor of less conspicuous rock-cut tombs."
The use of the pyramid form continued in private tomb chapels of the New Kingdom and in the royal pyramids of Nubia.
"For over 3500 years, artists adhered to artistic forms and iconography that were developed during the Old Kingdom, following a strict set of principles that resisted foreign influence and internal change."
"These artistic standards—simple lines, shapes, and flat areas of color combined with the characteristic flat projection of figures with no indication of spatial depth—created a sense of order and balance within a composition."
"Images and text were intimately interwoven on tomb and temple walls, coffins, stelae, and even statues."
"The Narmer Palette, for example, displays figures that can also be read as hieroglyphs."
"Paints were obtained from minerals such as iron ores (red and yellow ochres), copper ores (blue and green), soot or charcoal (black), and limestone (white)."
"Common citizens had access to pieces of funerary art, such as shabti statues and books of the dead, which they believed would protect them in the afterlife."
"During the Middle Kingdom, wooden or clay models depicting scenes from everyday life became popular additions to the tomb."
"After the invasion of the Hyksos in the Second Intermediate Period, Minoan-style frescoes were found in Avaris."
"The most striking example of a politically driven change in artistic forms comes from the Amarna Period, where figures were radically altered to conform to Akhenaten's revolutionary religious ideas."
"This style, known as Amarna art, was quickly abandoned after Akhenaten's death and replaced by the traditional forms."
The Egyptian pantheon was populated by gods who had supernatural powers and were called on for help or protection.
"However, the gods were not always viewed as benevolent, and Egyptians believed they had to be appeased with offerings and prayers."
"The structure of this pantheon changed continually as new deities were promoted in the hierarchy, but priests made no effort to organize the diverse and sometimes conflicting myths and stories into a coherent system."
These various conceptions of divinity were not considered contradictory but rather layers in the multiple facets of reality.
Gods were worshiped in cult temples administered by priests acting on the king's behalf.
At the center of the temple was the cult statue in a shrine.
"Temples were not places of public worship or congregation, and only on select feast days and celebrations was a shrine carrying the statue of the god brought out for public worship."
"Normally, the god's domain was sealed off from the outside world and was only accessible to temple officials."
"Common citizens could worship private statues in their homes, and amulets offered protection against the forces of chaos."
"After the New Kingdom, the pharaoh's role as a spiritual intermediary was de-emphasized as religious customs shifted to direct worship of the gods."
"In addition to the body, each person had a šwt (shadow), a ba (personality or soul), a ka (life-force), and a name."
"The heart, rather than the brain, was considered the seat of thoughts and emotions."
"After death, the spiritual aspects were released from the body and could move at will, but they required the physical remains (or a substitute, such as a statue) as a permanent home."
"The ultimate goal of the deceased was to rejoin his ka and ba and become one of the ""blessed dead"", living on as an akh, or ""effective one""."
"For this to happen, the deceased had to be judged worthy in a trial, in which the heart was weighed against a ""feather of truth."""
"If deemed worthy, the deceased could continue their existence on earth in spiritual form."
"If they were not deemed worthy, their heart was eaten by Ammit the Devourer and they were erased from the Universe."
"These customs involved preserving the body by mummification, performing burial ceremonies, and interring with the body goods the deceased would use in the afterlife."
"Before the Old Kingdom, bodies buried in desert pits were naturally preserved by desiccation."
"The arid, desert conditions were a boon throughout the history of ancient Egypt for burials of the poor, who could not afford the elaborate burial preparations available to the elite."
"Wealthier Egyptians began to bury their dead in stone tombs and use artificial mummification, which involved removing the internal organs, wrapping the body in linen, and burying it in a rectangular stone sarcophagus or wooden coffin."
"Beginning in the Fourth Dynasty, some parts were preserved separately in canopic jars."
"By the New Kingdom, the ancient Egyptians had perfected the art of mummification; the best technique took 70 days and involved removing the internal organs, removing the brain through the nose, and desiccating the body in a mixture of salts called natron."
The body was then wrapped in linen with protective amulets inserted between layers and placed in a decorated anthropoid coffin.
Mummies of the Late Period were also placed in painted cartonnage mummy cases.
"Funerary texts were often included in the grave, and, beginning in the New Kingdom, so were shabti statues that were believed to perform manual labor for them in the afterlife."
Rituals in which the deceased was magically re-animated accompanied burials.
"After burial, living relatives were expected to occasionally bring food to the tomb and recite prayers on behalf of the deceased."
The military protected mining expeditions to the Sinai during the Old Kingdom and fought civil wars during the First and Second Intermediate Periods.
"The military was responsible for maintaining fortifications along important trade routes, such as those found at the city of Buhen on the way to Nubia."
"Forts also were constructed to serve as military bases, such as the fortress at Sile, which was a base of operations for expeditions to the Levant."
"In the New Kingdom, the military began using chariots that had earlier been introduced by the Hyksos invaders."
"Weapons and armor continued to improve after the adoption of bronze: shields were now made from solid wood with a bronze buckle, spears were tipped with a bronze point, and the khopesh was adopted from Asiatic soldiers."
"The pharaoh was usually depicted in art and literature riding at the head of the army; it has been suggested that at least a few pharaohs, such as Seqenenre Tao II and his sons, did do so."
"However, it has also been argued that ""kings of this period did not personally act as frontline war leaders, fighting alongside their troops."""
"Soldiers were recruited from the general population, but during, and especially after, the New Kingdom, mercenaries from Nubia, Kush, and Libya were hired to fight for Egypt."
The Egyptians created their own alphabet and decimal system.
"Faience is a non-clay ceramic made of silica, small amounts of lime and soda, and a colorant, typically copper."
"The material was used to make beads, tiles, figurines, and small wares."
"Several methods can be used to create faience, but typically production involved application of the powdered materials in the form of a paste over a clay core, which was then fired."
"By a related technique, the ancient Egyptians produced a pigment known as Egyptian blue, also called blue frit, which is produced by fusing (or sintering) silica, copper, lime, and an alkali such as natron."
"It is also unclear whether they made their own raw glass or merely imported pre-made ingots, which they melted and finished."
"However, they did have technical expertise in making objects, as well as adding trace elements to control the color of the finished glass."
"A range of colors could be produced, including yellow, red, green, blue, purple, and white, and the glass could be made either transparent or opaque."
"Living and working close to the Nile brought hazards from malaria and debilitating schistosomiasis parasites, which caused liver and intestinal damage."
Dangerous wildlife such as crocodiles and hippos were also a common threat.
"The lifelong labors of farming and building put stress on the spine and joints, and traumatic injuries from construction and warfare all took a significant toll on the body."
"Despite the flattering physiques portrayed on tomb walls, the overweight mummies of many of the upper class show the effects of a life of overindulgence."
"Adult life expectancy was about 35 for men and 30 for women, but reaching adulthood was difficult as about one-third of the population died in infancy."
"Ancient Egyptian physicians were renowned in the ancient Near East for their healing skills, and some, such as Imhotep, remained famous long after their deaths."
"Herodotus remarked that there was a high degree of specialization among Egyptian physicians, with some treating only the head or the stomach, while others were eye-doctors and dentists."
"Training of physicians took place at the Per Ankh or ""House of Life"" institution, most notably those headquartered in Per-Bastet during the New Kingdom and at Abydos and Saïs in the Late period."
The earliest records of burn treatment describe burn dressings that use the milk from mothers of male babies.
Prayers were made to the goddess Isis.
"Moldy bread, honey, and copper salts were also used to prevent infection from dirt in burns."
Garlic and onions were used regularly to promote good health and were thought to relieve asthma symptoms.
"Ancient Egyptian surgeons stitched wounds, set broken bones, and amputated diseased limbs, but they recognized that some injuries were so serious that they could only make the patient comfortable until death occurred."
The Archaeological Institute of America reports that the oldest planked ships known are the Abydos boats.
"A group of 14 discovered ships in Abydos were constructed of wooden planks ""sewn"" together."
"Discovered by Egyptologist David O'Connor of New York University, woven straps were found to have been used to lash the planks together, and reeds or grass stuffed between the planks helped to seal the seams."
"Because the ships are all buried together and near a mortuary belonging to Pharaoh Khasekhemwy, originally they were all thought to have belonged to him, but one of the 14 ships dates to 3000 BC, and the associated pottery jars buried with the vessels also suggest earlier dating."
Early Egyptians also knew how to fasten the planks of this ship together with mortise and tenon joints.
"Large seagoing ships are known to have been heavily used by the Egyptians in their trade with the city states of the eastern Mediterranean, especially Byblos (on the coast of modern-day Lebanon), and in several expeditions down the Red Sea to the Land of Punt."
"Some of the site's most evocative evidence for the ancient Egyptians' seafaring prowess include large ship timbers and hundreds of feet of ropes, made from papyrus, coiled in huge bundles."
It was dated to the Middle Kingdom of Egypt by extrapolating dates of ancient sites constructed along its course.
"The importance of mathematics to an educated Egyptian is suggested by a New Kingdom fictional letter in which the writer proposes a scholarly competition between himself and another scribe regarding everyday calculation tasks such as accounting of land, labor, and grain."
"Texts such as the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus and the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus show that the ancient Egyptians could perform the four basic mathematical operations—addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division—use fractions, calculate the areas of rectangles, triangles, and circles and compute the volumes of boxes, columns and pyramids."
"They understood basic concepts of algebra and geometry, and could solve simple sets of simultaneous equations."
"Mathematical notation was decimal, and based on hieroglyphic signs for each power of ten up to one million."
"Each of these could be written as many times as necessary to add up to the desired number; so to write the number eighty or eight hundred, the symbol for ten or one hundred was written eight times respectively."
"Because their methods of calculation could not handle most fractions with a numerator greater than one, they had to write fractions as the sum of several fractions."
"For example, they resolved the fraction two-fifths into the sum of one-third + one-fifteenth."
Standard tables of values facilitated this.
"They were aware, for example, that a triangle had a right angle opposite the hypotenuse when its sides were in a 3–4–5 ratio."
"Whilst not conclusive, because of the non-exhaustive time frame (New Kingdom to Roman period) and restricted location that the mummies represent, their study nevertheless showed that these ancient Egyptians ""closely resembled ancient and modern Near Eastern populations, especially those in the Levant, and had almost no DNA from sub-Saharan Africa."
"What's more, the genetics of the mummies remained remarkably consistent even as different powers—including Nubians, Greeks, and Romans—conquered the empire."""
"Later, however, something did alter the genomes of Egyptians."
"Some 15% to 20% of modern Egyptians' DNA reflects sub-Saharan ancestry, but the ancient mummies had only 6–15% sub-Saharan DNA."
They called for additional research to be undertaken.
"Other genetic studies show much greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry in the current-day populations of southern as opposed to northern Egypt, and anticipate that mummies from southern Egypt would contain greater levels of sub-Saharan African ancestry than Lower Egyptian mummies."
"Egyptian civilization significantly influenced the Kingdom of Kush and Meroë with both adopting Egyptian religious and architectural norms (hundreds of pyramids (6–30 meters high) were built in Egypt/Sudan), as well as using Egyptian writing as the basis of the Meroitic script."
"Meroitic is the oldest written language in Africa, other than Egyptian, and was used from the 2nd century BC until the early 5th century AD."
"The cult of the goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome."
The Romans also imported building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures.
"In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, European travelers and tourists brought back antiquities and wrote stories of their journeys, leading to a wave of Egyptomania across Europe."
"This renewed interest sent collectors to Egypt, who took, purchased, or were given many important antiquities."
"The Supreme Council of Antiquities now approves and oversees all excavations, which are aimed at finding information rather than treasure."
The council also supervises museums and monument reconstruction programs designed to preserve the historical legacy of Egypt.
"It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry in order to explain their origin and evolution."
"Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, nebulae, galaxies, and comets."
"Relevant phenomena include supernova explosions, gamma ray bursts, quasars, blazars, pulsars, and cosmic microwave background radiation."
"More generally, astronomy studies everything that originates outside Earth's atmosphere."
Cosmology is a branch of astronomy.
The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky.
"These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya, and many ancient indigenous peoples of the Americas."
"In the past, astronomy included disciplines as diverse as astrometry, celestial navigation, observational astronomy, and the making of calendars."
Observational astronomy is focused on acquiring data from observations of astronomical objects.
This data is then analyzed using basic principles of physics.
Theoretical astronomy is oriented toward the development of computer or analytical models to describe astronomical objects and phenomena.
These two fields complement each other.
Theoretical astronomy seeks to explain observational results and observations are used to confirm theoretical results.
Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role.
This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events.
"Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets."
"Astronomy should not be confused with astrology, the belief system which claims that human affairs are correlated with the positions of celestial objects."
"Although the two fields share a common origin, they are now entirely distinct."
"Based on strict dictionary definitions, ""astronomy"" refers to ""the study of objects and matter outside the Earth's atmosphere and of their physical and chemical properties,"" while ""astrophysics"" refers to the branch of astronomy dealing with ""the behavior, physical properties, and dynamic processes of celestial objects and phenomena""."
"In some cases, as in the introduction of the introductory textbook The Physical Universe by Frank Shu, ""astronomy"" may be used to describe the qualitative study of the subject, whereas ""astrophysics"" is used to describe the physics-oriented version of the subject."
"However, since most modern astronomical research deals with subjects related to physics, modern astronomy could actually be called astrophysics."
"Some fields, such as astrometry, are purely astronomy rather than also astrophysics."
"Various departments in which scientists carry out research on this subject may use ""astronomy"" and ""astrophysics"", partly depending on whether the department is historically affiliated with a physics department, and many professional astronomers have physics rather than astronomy degrees."
"Some titles of the leading scientific journals in this field include The Astronomical Journal, The Astrophysical Journal, and Astronomy & Astrophysics."
"In some locations, early cultures assembled massive artifacts that possibly had some astronomical purpose."
"As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled and ideas on the nature of the Universe began to develop."
"Most early astronomy consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry."
"From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically."
"The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it."
"This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy."
"A particularly important early development was the beginning of mathematical and scientific astronomy, which began among the Babylonians, who laid the foundations for the later astronomical traditions that developed in many other civilizations."
The Babylonians discovered that lunar eclipses recurred in a repeating cycle known as a saros.
"Following the Babylonians, significant advances in astronomy were made in ancient Greece and the Hellenistic world."
"Greek astronomy is characterized from the start by seeking a rational, physical explanation for celestial phenomena."
"In the 3rd century BC, Aristarchus of Samos estimated the size and distance of the Moon and Sun, and he proposed a model of the Solar System where the Earth and planets rotated around the Sun, now called the heliocentric model."
"In the 2nd century BC, Hipparchus discovered precession, calculated the size and distance of the Moon and invented the earliest known astronomical devices such as the astrolabe."
"Hipparchus also created a comprehensive catalog of 1020 stars, and most of the constellations of the northern hemisphere derive from Greek astronomy."
"Technological artifacts of similar complexity did not reappear until the 14th century, when mechanical astronomical clocks appeared in Europe."
Astronomy flourished in the Islamic world and other parts of the world.
This led to the emergence of the first astronomical observatories in the Muslim world by the early 9th century.
"In 964, the Andromeda Galaxy, the largest galaxy in the Local Group, was described by the Persian Muslim astronomer Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi in his Book of Fixed Stars."
"The SN 1006 supernova, the brightest apparent magnitude stellar event in recorded history, was observed by the Egyptian Arabic astronomer Ali ibn Ridwan and Chinese astronomers in 1006."
"Some of the prominent Islamic (mostly Persian and Arab) astronomers who made significant contributions to the science include Al-Battani, Thebit, Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi, Biruni, Abū Ishāq Ibrāhīm al-Zarqālī, Al-Birjandi, and the astronomers of the Maragheh and Samarkand observatories."
"In Post-classical West Africa, Astronomers studied the movement of stars and relation to seasons, crafting charts of the heavens as well as precise diagrams of orbits of the other planets based on complex mathematical calculations."
Songhai historian Mahmud Kati documented a meteor shower in August 1583.
Among the Church's motives was finding the date for Easter.
His work was defended by Galileo Galilei and expanded upon by Johannes Kepler.
Kepler was the first to devise a system that correctly described the details of the motion of the planets around the Sun.
"However, Kepler did not succeed in formulating a theory behind the laws he wrote down."
"It was Isaac Newton, with his invention of celestial dynamics and his law of gravitation, who finally explained the motions of the planets."
"The English astronomer John Flamsteed catalogued over 3000 stars, More extensive star catalogues were produced by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille."
"Joseph von Fraunhofer discovered about 600 bands in the spectrum of the Sun in 1814–15, which, in 1859, Gustav Kirchhoff ascribed to the presence of different elements."
The observed recession of those galaxies led to the discovery of the expansion of the Universe.
"Theoretical astronomy led to speculations on the existence of objects such as black holes and neutron stars, which have been used to explain such observed phenomena as quasars, pulsars, blazars, and radio galaxies."
Physical cosmology made huge advances during the 20th century.
"In the early 1900s the model of the Big Bang theory was formulated, heavily evidenced by cosmic microwave background radiation, Hubble's law, and the cosmological abundances of elements."
Space telescopes have enabled measurements in parts of the electromagnetic spectrum normally blocked or blurred by the atmosphere.
"In February 2016, it was revealed that the LIGO project had detected evidence of gravitational waves in the previous September."
Observational astronomy may be categorized according to the corresponding region of the electromagnetic spectrum on which the observations are made.
"Some parts of the spectrum can be observed from the Earth's surface, while other parts are only observable from either high altitudes or outside the Earth's atmosphere."
Specific information on these subfields is given below.
Radio astronomy is different from most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons.
"The infrared spectrum is useful for studying objects that are too cold to radiate visible light, such as planets, circumstellar disks or nebulae whose light is blocked by dust."
"The longer wavelengths of infrared can penetrate clouds of dust that block visible light, allowing the observation of young stars embedded in molecular clouds and the cores of galaxies."
Observations from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) have been particularly effective at unveiling numerous Galactic protostars and their host star clusters.
"With the exception of infrared wavelengths close to visible light, such radiation is heavily absorbed by the atmosphere, or masked, as the atmosphere itself produces significant infrared emission."
"Consequently, infrared observatories have to be located in high, dry places on Earth or in space."
Some molecules radiate strongly in the infrared.
This allows the study of the chemistry of space; more specifically it can detect water in comets.
Images of observations were originally drawn by hand.
"In the late 19th century and most of the 20th century, images were made using photographic equipment."
"Modern images are made using digital detectors, particularly using charge-coupled devices (CCDs) and recorded on modern medium."
"Although visible light itself extends from approximately 4000 Å to 7000 Å (400 nm to 700 nm), that same equipment can be used to observe some near-ultraviolet and near-infrared radiation."
"Light at those wavelengths is absorbed by the Earth's atmosphere, requiring observations at these wavelengths to be performed from the upper atmosphere or from space."
Ultraviolet astronomy is best suited to the study of thermal radiation and spectral emission lines from hot blue stars (OB stars) that are very bright in this wave band.
"This includes the blue stars in other galaxies, which have been the targets of several ultraviolet surveys."
"Other objects commonly observed in ultraviolet light include planetary nebulae, supernova remnants, and active galactic nuclei."
"However, as ultraviolet light is easily absorbed by interstellar dust, an adjustment of ultraviolet measurements is necessary."
Gamma rays may be observed directly by satellites such as the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory or by specialized telescopes called atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes.
"These steady gamma-ray emitters include pulsars, neutron stars, and black hole candidates such as active galactic nuclei."
"In neutrino astronomy, astronomers use heavily shielded underground facilities such as SAGE, GALLEX, and Kamioka II/III for the detection of neutrinos."
"The vast majority of the neutrinos streaming through the Earth originate from the Sun, but 24 neutrinos were also detected from supernova 1987A."
"Cosmic rays, which consist of very high energy particles (atomic nuclei) that can decay or be absorbed when they enter the Earth's atmosphere, result in a cascade of secondary particles which can be detected by current observatories."
"A few observatories have been constructed, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO."
"LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole."
"Historically, accurate knowledge of the positions of the Sun, Moon, planets and stars has been essential in celestial navigation (the use of celestial objects to guide navigation) and in the making of calendars."
"Careful measurement of the positions of the planets has led to a solid understanding of gravitational perturbations, and an ability to determine past and future positions of the planets with great accuracy, a field known as celestial mechanics."
"Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared."
Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy.
Analytical models of a process are better for giving broader insight into the heart of what is going on.
The observation of a phenomenon predicted by a model allows astronomers to select between several alternate or conflicting models as the one best able to describe the phenomena.
Theorists also try to generate or modify models to take into account new data.
"In the case of an inconsistency between the data and model's results, the general tendency is to try to make minimal modifications to the model so that it produces results that fit the data."
"In some cases, a large amount of inconsistent data over time may lead to total abandonment of a model."
"Phenomena modeled by theoretical astronomers include: stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation; large-scale distribution of matter in the Universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics."
Astrophysical relativity serves as a tool to gauge the properties of large scale structures for which gravitation plays a significant role in physical phenomena investigated and as the basis for black hole (astro)physics and the study of gravitational waves.
"Some widely accepted and studied theories and models in astronomy, now included in the Lambda-CDM model are the Big Bang, dark matter and fundamental theories of physics."
"Among the objects studied are the Sun, other stars, galaxies, extrasolar planets, the interstellar medium and the cosmic microwave background."
"Their emissions are examined across all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, and the properties examined include luminosity, density, temperature, and chemical composition."
"Because astrophysics is a very broad subject, astrophysicists typically apply many disciplines of physics, including mechanics, electromagnetism, statistical mechanics, thermodynamics, quantum mechanics, relativity, nuclear and particle physics, and atomic and molecular physics."
"In practice, modern astronomical research often involves a substantial amount of work in the realms of theoretical and observational physics."
"Some areas of study for astrophysicists include their attempts to determine the properties of dark matter, dark energy, and black holes; whether or not time travel is possible, wormholes can form, or the multiverse exists; and the origin and ultimate fate of the universe."
"Topics also studied by theoretical astrophysicists include Solar System formation and evolution; stellar dynamics and evolution; galaxy formation and evolution; magnetohydrodynamics; large-scale structure of matter in the universe; origin of cosmic rays; general relativity and physical cosmology, including string cosmology and astroparticle physics."
The discipline is an overlap of astronomy and chemistry.
"The word ""astrochemistry"" may be applied to both the Solar System and the interstellar medium."
"The study of the abundance of elements and isotope ratios in Solar System objects, such as meteorites, is also called cosmochemistry, while the study of interstellar atoms and molecules and their interaction with radiation is sometimes called molecular astrophysics."
"The formation, atomic and chemical composition, evolution and fate of molecular gas clouds is of special interest, because it is from these clouds that solar systems form."
"Studies in this field contribute to the understanding of the formation of the Solar System, Earth's origin and geology, abiogenesis, and the origin of climate and oceans."
"Astrobiology considers the question of whether extraterrestrial life exists, and how humans can detect it if it does."
The origin and early evolution of life is an inseparable part of the discipline of astrobiology.
"Astrobiology concerns itself with interpretation of existing scientific data, and although speculation is entertained to give context, astrobiology concerns itself primarily with hypotheses that fit firmly into existing scientific theories."
"This interdisciplinary field encompasses research on the origin of planetary systems, origins of organic compounds in space, rock-water-carbon interactions, abiogenesis on Earth, planetary habitability, research on biosignatures for life detection, and studies on the potential for life to adapt to challenges on Earth and in outer space."
"Observations of the large-scale structure of the Universe, a branch known as physical cosmology, have provided a deep understanding of the formation and evolution of the cosmos."
"In the very early moments, it is theorized that the Universe experienced a very rapid cosmic inflation, which homogenized the starting conditions."
"Thereafter, nucleosynthesis produced the elemental abundance of the early Universe."
"When the first neutral atoms formed from a sea of primordial ions, space became transparent to radiation, releasing the energy viewed today as the microwave background radiation."
"Matter accumulated in the densest regions, forming clouds of gas and the earliest stars, the Population III stars."
"Gradually, organizations of gas and dust merged to form the first primitive galaxies."
"Interdisciplinary studies involve the fields of quantum mechanics, particle physics, plasma physics, condensed matter physics, statistical mechanics, optics, and nuclear physics."
Fundamental to the structure of the Universe is the existence of dark matter and dark energy.
"These are now thought to be its dominant components, forming 96% of the mass of the Universe."
"For this reason, much effort is expended in trying to understand the physics of these components."
"Finally, the latter is important for the understanding of the large-scale structure of the cosmos."
Most galaxies are organized into distinct shapes that allow for classification schemes.
The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction.
"These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and older stars."
"Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found at the core of galactic clusters, and may have been formed through mergers of large galaxies."
"A spiral galaxy is organized into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or bar at the center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward."
The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a blue tint.
Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars.
"Both the Milky Way and one of our nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies."
"Irregular galaxies are chaotic in appearance, and are neither spiral nor elliptical."
"About a quarter of all galaxies are irregular, and the peculiar shapes of such galaxies may be the result of gravitational interaction."
"An active galaxy is a formation that emits a significant amount of its energy from a source other than its stars, dust and gas."
"It is powered by a compact region at the core, thought to be a super-massive black hole that is emitting radiation from in-falling material."
"A radio galaxy is an active galaxy that is very luminous in the radio portion of the spectrum, and is emitting immense plumes or lobes of gas."
"Active galaxies that emit shorter frequency, high-energy radiation include Seyfert galaxies, Quasars, and Blazars."
"This structure is organized into a hierarchy of groupings, with the largest being the superclusters."
"The collective matter is formed into filaments and walls, leaving large voids between."
"It is a rotating mass of gas, dust, stars and other objects, held together by mutual gravitational attraction."
"As the Earth is located within the dusty outer arms, there are large portions of the Milky Way that are obscured from view."
"In the center of the Milky Way is the core, a bar-shaped bulge with what is believed to be a supermassive black hole at its center."
This is surrounded by four primary arms that spiral from the core.
"This is a region of active star formation that contains many younger, population I stars."
"In the densest regions, molecular clouds of molecular hydrogen and other elements create star-forming regions."
"The stellar wind and supernova explosions from these stars eventually cause the cloud to disperse, often leaving behind one or more young open clusters of stars."
"A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of this dark matter remains undetermined."
The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior.
"Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds."
"When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a protostar."
"The more massive the star, the greater its luminosity, and the more rapidly it fuses its hydrogen fuel into helium in its core."
"Over time, this hydrogen fuel is completely converted into helium, and the star begins to evolve."
The fusion of helium requires a higher core temperature.
A star with a high enough core temperature will push its outer layers outward while increasing its core density.
"The resulting red giant formed by the expanding outer layers enjoys a brief life span, before the helium fuel in the core is in turn consumed."
The ejection of the outer layers forms a planetary nebula.
"The remnant of a supernova is a dense neutron star, or, if the stellar mass was at least three times that of the Sun, a black hole."
"Closely orbiting binary stars can follow more complex evolutionary paths, such as mass transfer onto a white dwarf companion that can potentially cause a supernova."
"Planetary nebulae and supernovae distribute the ""metals"" produced in the star by fusion to the interstellar medium; without them, all new stars (and their planetary systems) would be formed from hydrogen and helium alone."
"The Sun is not considered a variable star, but it does undergo periodic changes in activity known as the sunspot cycle."
This is an 11-year oscillation in sunspot number.
The Sun has also undergone periodic changes in luminosity that can have a significant impact on the Earth.
Above this layer is a thin region known as the chromosphere.
"This is surrounded by a transition region of rapidly increasing temperatures, and finally by the super-heated corona."
"At the center of the Sun is the core region, a volume of sufficient temperature and pressure for nuclear fusion to occur."
"Above the core is the radiation zone, where the plasma conveys the energy flux by means of radiation."
Above that is the convection zone where the gas material transports energy primarily through physical displacement of the gas known as convection.
"As the solar wind passes the Earth, it interacts with the Earth's magnetic field (magnetosphere) and deflects the solar wind, but traps some creating the Van Allen radiation belts that envelop the Earth."
The aurora are created when solar wind particles are guided by the magnetic flux lines into the Earth's polar regions where the lines then descend into the atmosphere.
"The Solar System has been relatively well-studied, initially through telescopes and then later by spacecraft."
"The inner terrestrial planets consist of Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars."
"Through a process that included gravitational attraction, collision, and accretion, the disk formed clumps of matter that, with time, became protoplanets."
"The radiation pressure of the solar wind then expelled most of the unaccreted matter, and only those planets with sufficient mass retained their gaseous atmosphere."
"The planets continued to sweep up, or eject, the remaining matter during a period of intense bombardment, evidenced by the many impact craters on the Moon."
"This process can form a stony or metallic core, surrounded by a mantle and an outer crust."
"uranium, thorium, and 26Al), or tidal heating caused by interactions with other bodies."
Some planets and moons accumulate enough heat to drive geologic processes such as volcanism and tectonics.
Those that accumulate or retain an atmosphere can also undergo surface erosion from wind or water.
"Smaller bodies, without tidal heating, cool more quickly; and their geological activity ceases with the exception of impact cratering."
"Archaeoastronomy is the study of ancient or traditional astronomies in their cultural context, utilizing archaeological and anthropological evidence."
"Astrobiology is the study of the advent and evolution of biological systems in the Universe, with particular emphasis on the possibility of non-terrestrial life."
Astrostatistics is the application of statistics to astrophysics to the analysis of vast amount of observational astrophysical data.
"The study of chemicals found in space, including their formation, interaction and destruction, is called astrochemistry."
"These substances are usually found in molecular clouds, although they may also appear in low temperature stars, brown dwarfs and planets."
"Cosmochemistry is the study of the chemicals found within the Solar System, including the origins of the elements and variations in the isotope ratios."
Both of these fields represent an overlap of the disciplines of astronomy and chemistry.
"As ""forensic astronomy"", finally, methods from astronomy have been used to solve problems of law and history."
"Common targets of amateur astronomers include the Sun, the Moon, planets, stars, comets, meteor showers, and a variety of deep-sky objects such as star clusters, galaxies, and nebulae."
Astronomy clubs are located throughout the world and many have programs to help their members set up and complete observational programs including those to observe all the objects in the Messier (110 objects) or Herschel 400 catalogues of points of interest in the night sky.
"One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur astrophotography, involves the taking of photos of the night sky."
"This includes the use of infrared filters on conventional telescopes, and also the use of radio telescopes."
"The pioneer of amateur radio astronomy was Karl Jansky, who started observing the sky at radio wavelengths in the 1930s."
Amateurs can make occultation measurements that are used to refine the orbits of minor planets.
"They can also discover comets, and perform regular observations of variable stars."
Improvements in digital technology have allowed amateurs to make impressive advances in the field of astrophotography.
"Answers to these may require the construction of new ground- and space-based instruments, and possibly new developments in theoretical and experimental physics."
"The fall of the Western Roman Empire (also called the fall of the Roman Empire or the fall of Rome) was the process of decline in the Western Roman Empire in which the Empire failed to enforce its rule, and its vast territory was divided into several successor polities."
"The Roman Empire lost the strengths that had allowed it to exercise effective control over its Western provinces; modern historians posit factors including the effectiveness and numbers of the army, the health and numbers of the Roman population, the strength of the economy, the competence of the Emperors, the internal struggles for power, the religious changes of the period, and the efficiency of the civil administration."
Increasing pressure from invading barbarians outside Roman culture also contributed greatly to the collapse.
"In 395, after winning two destructive civil wars, Theodosius I died, leaving a collapsing field army and the Empire, still plagued by Goths, divided between the warring ministers of his two incapable sons."
"Further barbarian groups crossed the Rhine and other frontiers and, like the Goths, were not exterminated, expelled or subjugated."
"The armed forces of the Western Empire became few and ineffective, and despite brief recoveries under able leaders, central rule was never effectively consolidated."
"By 476, the position of Western Roman Emperor wielded negligible military, political, or financial power, and had no effective control over the scattered Western domains that could still be described as Roman."
Barbarian kingdoms had established their own power in much of the area of the Western Empire.
"In 476, the Germanic barbarian king Odoacer deposed the last emperor of the Western Roman Empire in Italy, Romulus Augustulus, and the Senate sent the imperial insignia to the Eastern Roman Emperor Flavius Zeno."
"While its legitimacy lasted for centuries longer and its cultural influence remains today, the Western Empire never had the strength to rise again."
It never again controlled any portion of Western Europe to the North of the Alps.
"The Eastern Roman, or Byzantine Empire survived, and though lessened in strength remained for centuries an effective power of the Eastern Mediterranean."
"While the loss of political unity and military control is universally acknowledged, the Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse."
"""From the eighteenth century onward,"" historian Glen Bowersock wrote, ""we have been obsessed with the fall: it has been valued as an archetype for every perceived decline, and, hence, as a symbol for our own fears."""
The Fall is not the only unifying concept for these events; the period described as Late Antiquity emphasizes the cultural continuities throughout and beyond the political collapse.
"The loss of centralized political control over the West, and the lessened power of the East, are universally agreed, but the theme of decline has been taken to cover a much wider time span than the hundred years from 376."
"For Cassius Dio, the accession of the emperor Commodus in 180 CE marked the descent ""from a kingdom of gold to one of rust and iron"", while Gibbon also began his narrative of decline from the reign of Commodus, after a number of introductory chapters."
"As one convenient marker for the end, 476 has been used since Gibbon, but other key dates for the fall of the Roman Empire in the West include the Crisis of the Third Century, the Crossing of the Rhine in 406 (or 405), the sack of Rome in 410, and the death of Julius Nepos in 480."
He gave great weight to internal decline as well as to attacks from outside the Empire.
"The story of its ruin is simple and obvious; and, instead of inquiring why the Roman empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it had subsisted so long."
"The victorious legions, who, in distant wars, acquired the vices of strangers and mercenaries, first oppressed the freedom of the republic, and afterwards violated the majesty of the purple."
"The emperors, anxious for their personal safety and the public peace, were reduced to the base expedient of corrupting the discipline which rendered them alike formidable to their sovereign and to the enemy; the vigour of the military government was relaxed, and finally dissolved, by the partial institutions of Constantine; and the Roman world was overwhelmed by a deluge of Barbarians."
"If the decline of the Roman empire was hastened by the conversion of Constantine, his victorious religion broke the violence of the fall, and mollified the ferocious temper of the conquerors (chapter 38)."
"Historians still try to analyze the reasons for loss of political control over a vast territory (and, as a subsidiary theme, the reasons for the survival of the Eastern Roman Empire)."
"Comparison has also been made with China after the end of the Han dynasty, which re-established unity under the Sui dynasty while the Mediterranean world remained politically disunited."
"Harper identifies a Roman climatic optimum from about 200 BCE to 150 CE, when lands around the Mediterranean were generally warm and well-watered."
"Climate change has also been suggested as a possible driver of changes in populations outside the Empire, in particular on the Eurasian steppe, though definte evidence is lacking."
Pirenne postponed the demise of classical civilization to the 8th century.
"He challenged the notion that Germanic barbarians had caused the Western Roman Empire to end, and he refused to equate the end of the Western Roman Empire with the end of the office of emperor in Italy."
"He pointed out the essential continuity of the economy of the Roman Mediterranean even after the barbarian invasions, and suggested that only the Muslim conquests represented a decisive break with antiquity."
"The more recent formulation of a historical period characterized as ""Late Antiquity"" emphasizes the transformations of ancient to medieval worlds within a cultural continuity."
In recent decades archaeologically-based argument even extends the continuity in material culture and in patterns of settlement as late as the eleventh century.
"Observing the political reality of lost control (and the attendant fragmentation of commerce, culture, and language), but also the cultural and archaeological continuities, the process has been described as a complex cultural transformation, rather than a fall."
"The Empire had large numbers of trained, supplied, and disciplined soldiers, drawn from a growing population."
It had a comprehensive civil administration based in thriving cities with effective control over public finances.
Among its literate elite it had ideological legitimacy as the only worthwhile form of civilization and a cultural unity based on comprehensive familiarity with Greek and Roman literature and rhetoric.
"Its financial system allowed it to raise significant taxes which, despite endemic corruption, supported a large regular army with logistics and training."
"The cursus honorum, a standardized series of military and civil posts organised for ambitious aristocratic men, ensured that powerful noblemen became familiar with military and civil command and administration."
"At a lower level within the army, connecting the aristocrats at the top with the private soldiers, a large number of centurions were well-rewarded, literate, and responsible for training, discipline, administration, and leadership in battle."
"City governments with their own properties and revenues functioned effectively at a local level; membership of city councils involved lucrative opportunities for independent decision-making, and, despite its obligations, became seen as a privilege."
"Under a series of emperors who each adopted a mature and capable successor, the Empire did not require civil wars to regulate the imperial succession."
"Requests could be submitted directly to the better emperors, and the answers had the force of law, putting the imperial power directly in touch with even humble subjects."
"The cults of polytheist religion were hugely varied, but none claimed that theirs was the only truth, and their followers displayed mutual tolerance, producing a polyphonous religious harmony."
Religious strife was rare after the suppression of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 136 (after which the devastated Judaea ceased to be a major centre for Jewish unrest).
"Nevertheless, it remained a culture based on an early subsistence economy, with no germ theory of disease."
"Despite its aqueducts, the water supply did not allow good hygiene, and sewage was disposed of on the streets, in open drains, or by scavenging animals."
"Even in the Roman Climatic Optimum, local harvest failures causing famines were always a possibility."
"And even in good times, Roman women needed to have, on average, six children each in order to maintain the population."
"Good nourishment and bodily cleanliness were privileges of the rich, advertised by their firm tread, healthy skin color, and lack of the ""dull smell of the underbathed""."
"Infant mortality was very high, diarrhoeal diseases were a major cause of death, and malaria was endemic in many areas, notably in the city of Rome itself, possibly encouraged by the enthusiasm of rich Romans for water features in their gardens."
"Heavy mortality in 165–180 from the Antonine Plague seriously impaired attempts to repel Germanic invaders, but the legions generally held or at least speedily re-instated the borders of the Empire."
The rising Sassanid Empire inflicted three crushing defeats on Roman field armies and remained a potent threat for centuries.
"Other disasters included repeated civil wars, barbarian invasions, and more mass-mortality in the Plague of Cyprian (from 250 onwards)."
"Rome abandoned the province of Dacia on the north of the Danube (271), and for a short period the Empire split into a Gallic Empire in the West (260–274), a Palmyrene Empire in the East (260–273), and a central Roman rump state."
"The Rhine/Danube frontier also came under more effective threats from larger barbarian groupings, which had developed improved agriculture and increased their populations."
"John the Lydian, writing over two centuries later, reported that Diocletian's army at one point totaled 389,704 men, plus 45,562 in the fleets, and numbers may have increased later."
"With the limited communications of the time, both the European and the Eastern frontiers needed the attention of their own supreme commanders."
"Diocletian tried to solve this problem by re-establishing an adoptive succession with a senior (Augustus) and junior (Caesar) emperor in each half of the Empire, but this system of tetrarchy broke down within one generation; the hereditary principle re-established itself with generally unfortunate results, and thereafter civil war became again the main method of establishing new imperial regimes."
"Receptio of barbarians became widely practised: imperial authorities admitted potentially hostile groups into the Empire, split them up, and allotted to them lands, status, and duties within the imperial system."
"In this way many groups provided unfree workers (coloni) for Roman landowners, and recruits (laeti) for the Roman army."
Sometimes their leaders became officers.
"Normally the Romans managed the process carefully, with sufficient military force on hand to ensure compliance, and cultural assimilation followed over the next generation or two."
"An elaborate court ceremonial developed, and obsequious flattery became the order of the day."
"Under Diocletian, the flow of direct requests to the emperor rapidly reduced and soon ceased altogether."
"While the scale, complexity, and violence of government were unmatched, the emperors lost control over their whole realm insofar as that control came increasingly to be wielded by anyone who paid for it."
"Meanwhile, the richest senatorial families, immune from most taxation, engrossed more and more of the available wealth and income, while also becoming divorced from any tradition of military excellence."
"Some scholars have seen this as an indication of weakness; others disagree, seeing neither barbarian recruits nor new rituals as causing any problem with the effectiveness or loyalty of the army."
"His successors generally continued this process, and Christianity became the religion of any ambitious civil official."
"This worsened the existing difficulty in keeping the city councils up to strength, and the services provided by the cities were scamped or abandoned."
"Public building projects became fewer, more often repairs than new construction, and now provided at state expense rather than by local grandees wishing to consolidate long-term local influence."
"Under Constantius, bandits came to dominate areas such as Isauria well within the empire."
The tribes of Germany also became more populous and more threatening.
"In Gaul, which did not really recover from the invasions of the third century, there was widespread insecurity and economic decline in the 300s, perhaps worst in Armorica."
"By 350, after decades of pirate attacks, virtually all villas in Armorica were deserted, and local use of money ceased about 360."
"Repeated attempts to economize on military expenditure included billeting troops in cities, where they could less easily be kept under military discipline and could more easily extort from civilians."
"Except in the rare case of a determined and incorruptible general, these troops proved ineffective in action and dangerous to civilians."
"Frontier troops were often given land rather than pay; as they farmed for themselves, their direct costs diminished, but so did their effectiveness, and there was much less economic stimulus to the frontier economy."
"However, extortion, gross corruption, and occasional ineffectiveness were not new to the Roman army; there is no consensus whether its effectiveness significantly declined before 376."
"Ammianus Marcellinus, himself a professional soldier, repeats longstanding observations about the superiority of contemporary Roman armies being due to training and discipline, not to physical size or strength."
"Despite a possible decrease in its ability to assemble and supply large armies, Rome maintained an aggressive and potent stance against perceived threats almost to the end of the fourth century."
In civil legislation Julian was notable for his pro-pagan policies.
"All Christian sects were officially tolerated by Julian, persecution of heretics was forbidden, and non-Christian religions were encouraged."
"He launched an expensive campaign against the Persians, which ended in defeat and his own death."
"He succeeded in marching to the Sassanid capital of Ctesiphon, but lacked adequate supplies for an assault."
"He burned his boats and supplies to show resolve in continuing operations, but the Sassanids began a war of attrition by burning crops."
"Finding himself cut off in enemy territory, he began a land retreat during which he was mortally wounded."
"To purchase safe passage home, he had to concede areas of northern Mesopotamia and Kurdistan, including the strategically important fortress of Nisibis, which had been Roman since before the Peace of Nisibis in 299."
"Valentinian in the West refused to intervene in religious controversy; in the East, Valens had to deal with Christians who did not conform to his ideas of orthodoxy, and persecution formed part of his response."
"The wealth of the church increased dramatically, immense resources both public and private being used for ecclesiastical construction and support of the religious life."
"Bishops in wealthy cities were thus able to offer vast patronage; Ammianus described some as ""enriched from the offerings of matrons, ride seated in carriages, wearing clothing chosen with care, and serve banquets so lavish that their entertainments outdo the tables of kings""."
"Edward Gibbon remarked that ""the soldiers' pay was lavished on the useless multitudes of both sexes who could only plead the merits of abstinence and chastity"", though there are no figures for the monks and nuns nor for their maintenance costs."
Pagan rituals and buildings had not been cheap either; the move to Christianity may not have had significant effects on the public finances.
"Gratian, ""alien from the art of government both by temperament and by training"" removed the Altar of Victory from the Senate House, and he rejected the pagan title of Pontifex Maximus."
"They were exploited by corrupt officials rather than effectively resettled, and they took up arms, joined by more Goths and by some Alans and Huns."
"Valens was in Asia with his main field army, preparing for an assault on the Persians, and redirecting the army and its logistic support would have required time."
Gratian's armies were distracted by Germanic invasions across the Rhine.
"In 378 Valens attacked the invaders with the Eastern field army, perhaps some 20,000 men—possibly only 10% of the soldiers nominally available in the Danube provinces—and in the Battle of Adrianople, 9 August 378, he lost much of that army and his own life."
"All of the Balkan provinces were thus exposed to raiding, without effective response from the remaining garrisons who were ""more easily slaughtered than sheep""."
"Cities were able to hold their own walls against barbarians who had no siege equipment, and they generally remained intact although the countryside suffered."
"During the next four years, he partially re-established the Roman position in the East."
"These campaigns depended on effective imperial coordination and mutual trust—between 379 and 380 Theodosius controlled not only the Eastern empire, but also, by agreement, the diocese of Illyricum."
"Theodosius was unable to recruit enough Roman troops, relying on barbarian warbands without Roman military discipline or loyalty."
"Instead they were either recruited into the imperial forces, or settled in the devastated provinces along the south bank of the Danube, where the regular garrisons were never fully re-established."
"In some later accounts, and widely in recent work, this is regarded as a treaty settlement, the first time that barbarians were given a home within the Empire in which they retained their political and military cohesion."
"No formal treaty is recorded, nor details of whatever agreement was actually made; when the Goths are next mentioned in Roman records, they have different leaders and are soldiers of a sort."
The business of subduing barbarian warbands also demanded substantial gifts of precious metal.
"Nevertheless, he is represented as financially lavish, though personally frugal when on campaign."
At least one extra levy provoked desperation and rioting in which the emperor's statues were destroyed.
"A contemporary reports that at his court ""everything was for sale"", with corruption rampant."
"He was pious, a Nicene Christian heavily influenced by Ambrose, and implacable against heretics."
"In 392 he forbade even private honor to the gods, and pagan rituals such as the Olympic Games."
He either ordered or connived at the widespread destruction of sacred buildings.
"His troops killed Gratian and he was accepted as Augustus in the Gallic provinces, where he was responsible for the first official executions of Christian heretics."
"To compensate the Western court for the loss of Gaul, Hispania, and Britannia, Theodosius ceded the diocese of Dacia and the diocese of Macedonia to their control."
"In 387 Maximus invaded Italy, forcing Valentinian II to flee to the East, where he accepted Nicene Christianity."
"Maximus boasted to Ambrose of the numbers of barbarians in his forces, and hordes of Goths, Huns, and Alans followed Theodosius."
"Maximus negotiated with Theodosius for acceptance as Augustus of the West, but Theodosius refused, gathered his armies, and counterattacked, winning the civil war in 388."
There were heavy troop losses on both sides of the conflict.
"He also appointed Arbogast, a pagan general of Frankish origin, as Valentinian's commander-in-chief and guardian."
"Valentinian quarreled in public with Arbogast, failed to assert any authority, and died, either by suicide or by murder, at the age of 21."
"Eugenius made some modest attempts to win pagan support, and with Arbogast led a large army to fight another destructive civil war."
"They were defeated and killed at the Battle of the Frigidus, which was attended by further heavy losses especially among the Gothic federates of Theodosius."
The north-eastern approaches to Italy were never effectively garrisoned again.
"In the immediate aftermath of Theodosius's death, the magister militum Stilicho, married to Theodosius's niece, asserted himself in the West as the guardian of Honorius and commander of the remains of the defeated Western army."
"He also claimed control over Arcadius in Constantinople, but Rufinus, magister officiorum on the spot, had already established his own power there."
"Henceforward the Empire was not under the control of one man, until much of the West had been permanently lost."
"Neither Honorius nor Arcadius ever displayed any ability either as rulers or as generals, and both lived as the puppets of their courts."
"Stilicho tried to reunite the Eastern and Western courts under his personal control, but in doing so achieved only the continued hostility of all of Arcadius's successive supreme ministers."
"The rich senatorial aristocrats in Rome itself became increasingly influential during the fifth century; they supported armed strength in theory, but did not wish to pay for it or to offer their own workers as army recruits."
"They did, however, pass large amounts of money to the Christian Church."
"Those exceptions were responsible for brief, but remarkable resurgences of Roman power."
Alaric was disappointed in his hopes for promotion to magister militum after the battle of the Frigidus.
"He again led Gothic tribesmen in arms and established himself as an independent power, burning the countryside as far as the walls of Constantinople."
"Alaric's ambitions for long-term Roman office were never quite acceptable to the Roman imperial courts, and his men could never settle long enough to farm in any one area."
They showed no inclination to leave the Empire and face the Huns from whom they had fled in 376; indeed the Huns were still stirring up further migrations which often ended by attacking Rome in turn.
"Alaric's group was never destroyed nor expelled from the Empire, nor acculturated under effective Roman domination."
"Alaric's forces made their way along the coast to Athens, where he sought to force a new peace upon the Romans."
His march in 396 passed through Thermopylae.
"Stilicho sailed from Italy to Greece with his remaining mobile forces, a clear threat to Rufinus' control of the Eastern empire."
"The bulk of Rufinus' forces were occupied with Hunnic incursions in Asia Minor and Syria, leaving Thrace undefended."
Stilicho's propagandist Claudian reports that only Stilicho's attack stemmed the plundering as he pushed Alaric's forces north into Epirus.
"Burns' interpretation is that Alaric and his men had been recruited by Rufinus's Eastern regime, and sent to Thessaly to stave off Stilicho's threat."
No battle took place.
"They went to Constantinople under the command of one Gainas, a Goth with a large Gothic following."
"On arrival, Gainas murdered Rufinus, and was appointed magister militum for Thrace by Eutropius, the new supreme minister and the only eunuch consul of Rome, who controlled Arcadius ""as if he were a sheep""."
Stilicho obtained a few more troops from the German frontier and continued to campaign ineffectively against the Eastern empire; again he was successfully opposed by Alaric and his men.
"During the next year, 397, Eutropius personally led his troops to victory over some Huns who were marauding in Asia Minor."
"With his position thus strengthened he declared Stilicho a public enemy, and he established Alaric as magister militum per Illyricum."
"A poem by Synesius advises the emperor to display manliness and remove a ""skin-clad savage"" (probably Alaric) from the councils of power and his barbarians from the Roman army."
"We do not know if Arcadius ever became aware of the existence of this advice, but it had no recorded effect."
"Synesius, from a province suffering the widespread ravages of a few poor but greedy barbarians, also complained of ""the peacetime war, one almost worse than the barbarian war and arising from military indiscipline and the officer's greed."""
The magister militum in the Diocese of Africa declared for the East and stopped the supply of grain to Rome.
Italy had not fed itself for centuries and could not do so now.
"In 398, Stilicho sent his last reserves, a few thousand men, to re-take the Diocese of Africa, and he strengthened his position further when he married his daughter Maria to Honorius."
"Throughout this period Stilicho, and all other generals, were desperately short of recruits and supplies for them."
He had reached the bottom of his recruitment pool.
"Though personally not corrupt, he was very active in confiscating assets; the financial and administrative machine was not producing enough support for the army."
"In 399, Tribigild's rebellion in Asia Minor allowed Gainas to accumulate a significant army (mostly Goths), become supreme in the Eastern court, and execute Eutropius."
He now felt that he could dispense with Alaric's services and he nominally transferred Alaric's province to the West.
"This administrative change removed Alaric's Roman rank and his entitlement to legal provisioning for his men, leaving his army—the only significant force in the ravaged Balkans—as a problem for Stilicho."
"In 400, the citizens of Constantinople revolted against Gainas and massacred as many of his people, soldiers and their families, as they could catch."
Some Goths at least built rafts and tried to cross the strip of sea that separates Asia from Europe; the Roman navy slaughtered them.
"By the beginning of 401, Gainas' head rode a pike through Constantinople while another Gothic general became consul."
"He left the Rhine defended only by the ""dread"" of Roman retaliation, rather than by adequate forces able to take the field."
"Early in spring, Alaric, probably desperate, invaded Italy, and he drove Honorius westward from Mediolanum, besieging him in Hasta Pompeia in Liguria."
"Stilicho returned as soon as the passes had cleared, meeting Alaric in two battles (near Pollentia and Verona) without decisive results."
"The Goths, weakened, were allowed to retreat back to Illyricum where the Western court again gave Alaric office, though only as comes and only over Dalmatia and Pannonia Secunda rather than the whole of Illyricum."
Stilicho probably supposed that this pact would allow him to put Italian government into order and recruit fresh troops.
He may also have planned with Alaric's help to relaunch his attempts to gain control over the Eastern court.
"However, in 405, Stilicho was distracted by a fresh invasion of Northern Italy."
"Another group of Goths fleeing the Huns, led by one Radagaisus, devastated the north of Italy for six months before Stilicho could muster enough forces to take the field against them."
Stilicho recalled troops from Britannia and the depth of the crisis was shown when he urged all Roman soldiers to allow their personal slaves to fight beside them.
"His forces, including Hun and Alan auxiliaries, may in the end have totalled rather less than 15,000 men."
Radagaisus was defeated and executed.
"12,000 prisoners from the defeated horde were drafted into Stilicho's service."
"Stilicho continued negotiations with Alaric; Flavius Aetius, son of one of Stilicho's major supporters, was sent as a hostage to Alaric in 405."
"In 406 Stilicho, hearing of new invaders and rebels who had appeared in the northern provinces, insisted on making peace with Alaric, probably on the basis that Alaric would prepare to move either against the Eastern court or against the rebels in Gaul."
"The Senate deeply resented peace with Alaric; in 407, when Alaric marched into Noricum and demanded a large payment for his expensive efforts in Stilicho's interests, the senate, ""inspired by the courage, rather than the wisdom, of their predecessors,"" preferred war."
"One senator famously declaimed Non est ista pax, sed pactio servitutis (""This is not peace, but a pact of servitude"")."
Stilicho paid Alaric four thousand pounds of gold nevertheless.
"In the East, Arcadius died on 1 May 408 and was replaced by his son Theodosius II; Stilicho seems to have planned to march to Constantinople, and to install there a regime loyal to himself."
He may also have intended to give Alaric a senior official position and send him against the rebels in Gaul.
"Before he could do so, while he was away at Ticinum at the head of a small detachment, a bloody coup against his supporters took place at Honorius's court."
"It was led by Stilicho's own creature, one Olympius."
"His army of barbarian troops, including a guard of Huns and many Goths, discussed attacking the forces of the coup, but Stilicho prevented them when he heard that the Emperor had not been harmed."
"Sarus's Gothic troops then massacred the Hun contingent in their sleep, and Stilicho withdrew from the quarreling remains of his army to Ravenna."
He ordered that his former soldiers should not be admitted into the cities in which their families were billeted.
"The conspiracy then massacred the families of the federate troops (as presumed supporters of Stilicho, although they had probably rebelled against him), and the troops defected en masse to Alaric."
"The conspirators seem to have let their main army disintegrate, and had no policy except hunting down supporters of Stilicho."
Italy was left without effective indigenous defence forces thereafter.
"He again offered to move his men, this time to Pannonia, in exchange for a modest sum of money and the modest title of Comes, but he was refused as a supporter of Stilicho."
"He moved into Italy, probably using the route and supplies arranged for him by Stilicho, bypassing the imperial court in Ravenna which was protected by widespread marshland and had a port, and he menaced the city of Rome itself."
Alaric's first siege of Rome in 408 caused dreadful famine within the walls.
"It was ended by a payment that, though large, was less than one of the richest senators could have produced."
The super-rich aristocrats made little contribution; pagan temples were stripped of ornaments to make up the total.
"Ataulf, a Goth nominally in Roman service and brother-in-law to Alaric, marched through Italy to join Alaric despite taking casualties from a small force of Hunnic mercenaries led by Olympius."
"Sarus was an enemy of Ataulf, and on Ataulf's arrival went back into imperial service."
"Alaric tried again to negotiate with Honorius, but his demands (now even more moderate, only frontier land and food) were inflated by the messenger and Honorius responded with insults, which were reported verbatim to Alaric."
He broke off negotiations and the standoff continued.
"Honorius's court made overtures to the usurper Constantine III in Gaul and arranged to bring Hunnic forces into Italy, Alaric ravaged Italy outside the fortified cities (which he could not garrison), and the Romans refused open battle (for which they had inadequate forces)."
Late in the year Alaric sent bishops to express his readiness to leave Italy if Honorius would only grant his people a supply of grain.
"The Senate in Rome, despite its loathing for Alaric, was now desperate enough to give him almost anything he wanted."
"They had no food to offer, but they tried to give him imperial legitimacy; with the Senate's acquiescence, he elevated Priscus Attalus as his puppet emperor, and he marched on Ravenna."
"Honorius was planning to flee to Constantinople when a reinforcing army of 4,000 soldiers from the East disembarked in Ravenna."
These garrisoned the walls and Honorius held on.
He had Constantine's principal court supporter executed and Constantine abandoned plans to march to Honorius's defence.
"Attalus failed to establish his control over the Diocese of Africa, and no grain arrived in Rome where the famine became even more frightful."
Jerome reports cannibalism within the walls.
"Attalus brought Alaric no real advantage, failing also to come to any useful agreement with Honorius (who was offered mutilation, humiliation, and exile)."
"The city of Rome was the seat of the richest senatorial noble families and the centre of their cultural patronage; to pagans it was the sacred origin of the empire, and to Christians the seat of the heir of Saint Peter, Pope Innocent I, the most authoritative bishop of the West."
Rome had not fallen to an enemy since the Battle of the Allia over eight centuries before.
"Refugees spread the news and their stories throughout the Empire, and the meaning of the fall was debated with religious fervour."
"Both Christians and pagans wrote embittered tracts, blaming paganism or Christianity respectively for the loss of Rome's supernatural protection, and blaming Stilicho's earthly failures in either case."
Some Christian responses anticipated the imminence of Judgement Day.
"Augustine in his book ""City of God"" ultimately rejected the pagan and Christian idea that religion should have worldly benefits; he developed the doctrine that the City of God in heaven, undamaged by mundane disasters, was the true objective of Christians."
"More practically, Honorius was briefly persuaded to set aside the laws forbidding pagans to be military officers, so that one Generidus could re-establish Roman control in Dalmatia."
"Generidus did this with unusual effectiveness; his techniques were remarkable for this period, in that they included training his troops, disciplining them, and giving them appropriate supplies even if he had to use his own money."
The penal laws were reinstated no later than 25 August 410 and the overall trend of repression of paganism continued.
"Procopius mentions a story in which Honorius, on hearing the news that Rome had ""perished"", was shocked, thinking the news was in reference to his favorite chicken he had named ""Roma""."
"And he cried out and said, ""And yet it has just eaten from my hands!"""
"For he had a very large cockerel, Roma by name; and the eunuch comprehending his words said that it was the city of Roma which had perished at the hands of Alaric, and the emperor with a sigh of relief answered quickly: ""But I thought that my fowl Roma had perished."""
"So great, they say, was the folly with which this emperor was possessed."
"His successor Ataulf, still regarded as an usurper and given only occasional and short-term grants of supplies, moved north into the turmoil of Gaul, where there was some prospect of food."
His supergroup of barbarians are called the Visigoths in modern works: they may now have been developing their own sense of identity.
"They may have been trying to get away from the Huns, who about this time advanced to occupy the Great Hungarian Plain."
"The last, Constantine III, raised an army from the remaining troops in Britannia, invaded Gaul and defeated forces loyal to Honorius led by Sarus."
"Constantine's power reached its peak in 409 when he controlled Gaul and beyond, he was joint consul with Honorius and his magister militum Gerontius defeated the last Roman force to try to hold the borders of Hispania."
It was led by relatives of Honorius; Constantine executed them.
Gerontius went to Hispania where he may have settled the Sueves and the Asding Vandals.
Gerontius then fell out with his master and elevated one Maximus as his own puppet emperor.
"He defeated Constantine and was besieging him in Arelate when Honorius's general Constantius arrived from Italy with an army (possibly, mainly of Hun mercenaries)."
Gerontius's troops deserted him and he committed suicide.
"Constantius continued the siege, defeating a relieving army."
"They asked for help from Honorius, who replied that they should look to their own defence."
"While the British may have regarded themselves as Roman for several generations, and British armies may at times have fought in Gaul, no central Roman government is known to have appointed officials in Britannia thereafter."
He relied on the support of Burgundians and Alans to whom he offered supplies and land.
In 413 Jovinus also recruited Sarus; Ataulf destroyed their regime in the name of Honorius and both Jovinus and Sarus were executed.
The Burgundians were settled on the left bank of the Rhine.
"Ataulf then operated in the south of Gaul, sometimes with short-term supplies from the Romans."
"All usurpers had been defeated, but large barbarian groups remained un-subdued in both Gaul and Hispania."
The imperial government was quick to restore the Rhine frontier.
The invading tribes of 407 moved into Spain at the end of 409; the Visigoths left Italy at the beginning of 412 and settled themselves around Narbo.
"Heraclianus was still in command in the diocese of Africa; of the clique that overthrew Stilicho, he was the last to retain power."
"The choir at the wedding included Attalus, a puppet emperor without revenues or soldiers."
"Ataulf famously declared that he had abandoned his intention to set up a Gothic empire because of the irredeemable barbarity of his followers, and instead he sought to restore the Roman Empire."
"He handed Attalus over to Honorius's regime for mutilation, humiliation, and exile, and abandoned Attalus's supporters."
"Ataulf moved out of Gaul, to Barcelona."
"There his infant son by Galla Placidia was buried, and there Ataulf was assassinated by one of his household retainers, possibly a former follower of Sarus."
His ultimate successor Wallia had no agreement with the Romans; his people had to plunder in Hispania for food.
"From 416 to 418, Wallia's Goths campaigned in Hispania on Constantius's behalf, exterminating the Siling Vandals in Baetica and reducing the Alans to the point where the survivors sought the protection of the king of the Asding Vandals."
"(After retrenchment they formed another barbarian supergroup, but for the moment they were reduced in numbers and effectively cowed.)"
"In 418, by agreement with Constantius, Wallia's Goths accepted land to farm in Aquitania."
"Constantius also reinstituted an annual council of the southern Gallic provinces, to meet at Arelate."
"Although Constantius rebuilt the western field army to some extent, he did so only by replacing half of its units (vanished in the wars since 395) by re-graded barbarians, and by garrison troops removed from the frontier."
The Notitia Dignitatum gives a list of the units of the western field army circa 425.
"The couple soon had two children, Honoria and Valentinian III, and Constantius was elevated to the position of Augustus in 420."
"This earned him the hostility of the Eastern court, which had not agreed to his elevation."
"But it marked huge losses of territory and of revenue; Rutilius travelled by ship past the ruined bridges and countryside of Tuscany, and in the west the River Loire had become the effective northern boundary of Roman Gaul."
In the east of Gaul the Franks controlled large areas; the effective line of Roman control until 455 ran from north of Cologne (lost to the Ripuarian Franks in 459) to Boulogne.
The Italian areas which had been compelled to support the Goths had most of their taxes remitted for several years.
"Even in southern Gaul and Hispania large barbarian groups remained, with thousands of warriors, in their own non-Roman military and social systems."
"Some occasionally acknowledged a degree of Roman political control, but without the local application of Roman leadership and military power they and their individual subgroups pursued their own interests."
"He had been careful to make sure that there was no successor in waiting, and his own children were far too young to take his place."
"Honorius was unable to control his own court, and the death of Constantius initiated more than ten years of instability."
Initially Galla Placidia sought Honorius's favour in the hope that her son might ultimately inherit.
"Other court interests managed to defeat her, and she fled with her children to the Eastern court in 422."
"Honorius himself died, shortly before his thirty-ninth birthday, in 423."
"After some months of intrigue, the patrician Castinus installed Joannes as Western Emperor, but the Eastern Roman government proclaimed the child Valentinian III instead, his mother Galla Placidia acting as regent during his minority."
Joannes had few troops of his own.
He sent Aetius to raise help from the Huns.
"An Eastern army landed in Italy, captured Joannes, cut his hand off, abused him in public, and killed him with most of his senior officials."
"Aetius returned, three days after Joannes' death, at the head of a substantial Hunnic army which made him the most powerful general in Italy."
"She tried for some years to avoid reliance on a single dominant military figure, maintaining a balance of power between her three senior officers, Aetius (magister militum in Gaul), Count Boniface governor in the Diocese of Africa, and Flavius Felix magister militum praesentalis in Italy."
"Meanwhile, the Empire deteriorated seriously."
"Apart from the losses in the Diocese of Africa, Hispania was slipping out of central control and into the hands of local rulers and Suevic bandits."
"In Gaul the Rhine frontier had collapsed, the Visigoths in Aquitaine may have launched further attacks on Narbo and Arelate, and the Franks, increasingly powerful although disunited, were the major power in the north-east."
"Aremorica was controlled by Bagaudae, local leaders not under the authority of the Empire."
"Aetius at least campaigned vigorously and mostly victoriously, defeating aggressive Visigoths, Franks, fresh Germanic invaders, Bagaudae in Aremorica, and a rebellion in Noricum."
"Not for the first time in Rome's history, a triumvirate of mutually distrustful rulers proved unstable."
"In 427 Felix tried to recall Boniface from Africa; he refused, and overcame Felix's invading force."
"(The Straits of Gibraltar were not an important thoroughfare at the time, and there were no significant fortifications nor military presence at this end of the Mediterranean.)"
"They spent a year moving slowly to Numidia, defeating Boniface."
He returned to Italy where Aetius had recently had Felix executed.
"Boniface was promoted to magister militum and earned the enmity of Aetius, who may have been absent in Gaul at the time."
"In 432 the two met at the Battle of Ravenna, which left Aetius's forces defeated and Boniface mortally wounded."
"Aetius temporarily retired to his estates, but after an attempt to murder him he raised another Hunnic army (probably by conceding parts of Pannonia to them) and in 433 he returned to Italy, overcoming all rivals."
"He never threatened to become an Augustus himself and thus maintained the support of the Eastern court, where Valentinian's cousin Theodosius II reigned until 450."
He relied heavily on his forces of Huns.
"With a ferocity celebrated centuries later in the Nibelungenlied, the Huns slaughtered many Burgundians on the middle Rhine, re-establishing the survivors as Roman allies, the first Kingdom of the Burgundians."
This may have returned some sort of Roman authority to Trier.
"Eastern troops reinforced Carthage, temporarily halting the Vandals, who in 435 agreed to limit themselves to Numidia and leave the most fertile parts of North Africa in peace."
"Aetius concentrated his limited military resources to defeat the Visigoths again, and his diplomacy restored a degree of order to Hispania."
"However, his general Litorius was badly defeated by the Visigoths at Toulouse, and a new Suevic king, Rechiar, began vigorous assaults on what remained of Roman Hispania."
At one point Rechiar even allied with Bagaudae.
"These were Romans not under imperial control; some of their reasons for rebellion may be indicated by the remarks of a Roman captive under Attila who was happy in his lot, giving a lively account of ""the vices of a declining empire, of which he had so long been the victim; the cruel absurdity of the Roman princes, unable to protect their subjects against the public enemy, unwilling to trust them with arms for their own defence; the intolerable weight of taxes, rendered still more oppressive by the intricate or arbitrary modes of collection; the obscurity of numerous and contradictory laws; the tedious and expensive forms of judicial proceedings; the partial administration of justice; and the universal corruption, which increased the influence of the rich, and aggravated the misfortunes of the poor."""
"Vegetius's advice on re-forming an effective army may be dated to the early 430s, (though a date in the 390s has also been suggested)."
"He identified many deficiencies in the military, especially mentioning that the soldiers were no longer properly equipped:From the foundation of the city till the reign of the Emperor Gratian, the foot wore cuirasses and helmets."
"But negligence and sloth having by degrees introduced a total relaxation of discipline, the soldiers began to think their armor too heavy, as they seldom put it on."
They first requested leave from the Emperor to lay aside the cuirass and afterwards the helmet.
"In consequence of this, our troops in their engagements with the Goths were often overwhelmed with their showers of arrows."
"Nor was the necessity of obliging the infantry to resume their cuirasses and helmets discovered, notwithstanding such repeated defeats, which brought on the destruction of so many great cities."
"Troops, defenseless and exposed to all the weapons of the enemy, are more disposed to fly than fight."
"What can be expected from a foot-archer without cuirass or helmet, who cannot hold at once his bow and shield; or from the ensigns whose bodies are naked, and who cannot at the same time carry a shield and the colors?"
The foot soldier finds the weight of a cuirass and even of a helmet intolerable.
This is because he is so seldom exercised and rarely puts them on.
A religious polemic of about this time complains bitterly of the oppression and extortion suffered by all but the richest Romans.
Many wished to flee to the Bagaudae or even to foul-smelling barbarians.
"""Although these men differ in customs and language from those with whom they have taken refuge, and are unaccustomed too, if I may say so, to the nauseous odor of the bodies and clothing of the barbarians, yet they prefer the strange life they find there to the injustice rife among the Romans."
"For by what other causes were they made Bagaudae save by our unjust acts, the wicked decisions of the magistrates, the proscription and extortion of those who have turned the public exactions to the increase of their private fortunes and made the tax indictions their opportunity for plunder?"
"""Gildas, a 6th-century monk and author of De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, wrote that ""No sooner were the ravages of the enemy checked, than the island [Britain] was deluged with a most extraordinary plenty of all things, greater than was before known, and with it grew up every kind of luxury and licentiousness."
"""Nevertheless, effective imperial protection from barbarian ravages was eagerly sought."
"About this time authorities in Britannia asked Aetius for help: ""To Aetius, now consul for the third time: the groans of the Britons."""
"And again a little further, thus: ""The barbarians drive us to the sea; the sea throws us back on the barbarians: thus two modes of death await us, we are either slain or drowned."""
"This brought immediate financial crisis to the Western Empire; the diocese of Africa was prosperous, normally required few troops to keep it secure, contributed large tax revenues, and exported wheat to feed Rome and many other areas."
"Roman troops assembled in Sicily, but the planned counter-attack never happened."
"Huns attacked the Eastern empire, and ""the troops, which had been sent against Genseric, were hastily recalled from Sicily; the garrisons, on the side of Persia, were exhausted; and a military force was collected in Europe, formidable by their arms and numbers, if the generals had understood the science of command, and the soldiers the duty of obedience."
"He kept his latest gains and his eldest son Huneric was honoured by betrothal to Valentinian III's daughter Eudocia, who carried the legitimacy of the conjoined Valentinianic and Theodosian dynasties."
"Huneric's Gothic wife was suspected of trying to poison her father-in-law Genseric; he sent her home without her nose or ears, and his Gothic alliance came to an early end."
"The Romans regained Numidia, and Rome again received a grain supply from Africa."
"The losses of income from the Diocese of Africa were equivalent to the costs of nearly 40,000 infantry or over 20,000 cavalry."
The imperial regime had to increase taxes.
"Despite admitting that the peasantry could pay no more, and that a sufficient army could not be raised, the imperial regime protected the interests of landowners displaced from Africa and allowed wealthy individuals to avoid taxes."
"His subjects included Huns, outnumbered several times over by other groups, predominantly Germanic."
Attila claimed Honoria as his wife and half of the Western Empire's territory as his dowry.
"Faced with refusal, he invaded Gaul in 451 with a huge army."
"In the bloody battle of the Catalaunian Plains the invasion was stopped by the combined forces of the barbarians within the Western empire, coordinated by Aetius and supported by what troops he could muster."
"The next year, Attila invaded Italy and proceeded to march upon Rome, but an outbreak of disease in his army, lack of supplies, reports that Eastern Roman troops were attacking his noncombatant population in Pannonia, and, possibly, Pope Leo's plea for peace induced him to halt this campaign."
Attila unexpectedly died a year later (453) and his empire crumbled as his followers fought for power.
"The life of Severinus of Noricum gives glimpses of the general insecurity, and ultimate retreat of the Romans on the Upper Danube, in the aftermath of Attila's death."
"The Romans were without adequate forces; the barbarians inflicted haphazard extortion, murder, kidnap, and plunder on the Romans and on each other."
"""So long as the Roman dominion lasted, soldiers were maintained in many towns at the public expense to guard the boundary wall."
"When this custom ceased, the squadrons of soldiers and the boundary wall were blotted out together."
"The troop at Batavis, however, held out."
"Some soldiers of this troop had gone to Italy to fetch the final pay to their comrades, and no one knew that the barbarians had slain them on the way."
"""In 454 Aetius was personally stabbed to death by Valentinian, who was himself murdered by the dead general's supporters a year later."
"""[Valentinian] thought he had slain his master; he found that he had slain his protector: and he fell a helpless victim to the first conspiracy which was hatched against his throne."""
"A rich senatorial aristocrat, Petronius Maximus, who had encouraged both murders, then seized the throne."
"He broke the engagement between Eudocia and Huneric, prince of the Vandals, and had time to send Avitus to ask for the help of the Visigoths in Gaul before a Vandal fleet arrived in Italy."
Petronius was unable to muster any effective defence and was killed by a mob as he tried to flee the city.
"The Vandals entered Rome, and plundered it for two weeks."
"Despite the shortage of money for the defence of the state, considerable private wealth had accumulated since the previous sack in 410."
"He moved on Rome with Visigothic support which gained his acceptance by Majorian and Ricimer, commanders of the remaining army of Italy."
This was the first time that a barbarian kingdom had played a key role in the imperial succession.
Avitus's son-in-law Sidonius Apollinaris wrote propaganda to present the Visigothic king Theoderic II as a reasonable man with whom a Roman regime could do business.
"Theoderic's payoff included precious metal from stripping the remaining public ornaments of Italy, and an unsupervised campaign in Hispania."
"There he not only defeated the Sueves, executing his brother-in-law Rechiar, but he also plundered Roman cities."
The Burgundians expanded their kingdom in the Rhone valley and the Vandals took the remains of the Diocese of Africa.
"In 456 the Visigothic army was too heavily engaged in Hispania to be an effective threat to Italy, and Ricimer had just destroyed a pirate fleet of sixty Vandal ships; Majorian and Ricimer marched against Avitus and defeated him near Placentia."
"He was forced to become Bishop of Placentia, and died (possibly murdered) a few weeks later."
"Ricimer was the son of a Suevic king, and his mother was the daughter of a Gothic one, so he could not aspire to an imperial throne."
"After some months, allowing for negotiation with the new emperor of Constantinople and the defeat of 900 Alamannic invaders of Italy by one of his subordinates, Majorian was acclaimed as Augustus."
"Majorian is described by Gibbon as ""a great and heroic character""."
"He rebuilt the army and navy of Italy with vigour and set about recovering the remaining Gallic provinces, which had not recognized his elevation."
"He defeated the Visigoths at the Battle of Arelate, reducing them to federate status and obliging them to give up their claims in Hispania; he moved on to subdue the Burgundians, the Gallo-Romans around Lugdunum (who were granted tax concessions and whose senior officials were appointed from their own ranks) and the Suevi and Bagaudae in Hispania."
"Marcellinus, magister militum in Dalmatia and the pagan general of a well-equipped army, acknowledged him as emperor and recovered Sicily from the Vandals."
Aegidius also acknowledged Majorian and took effective charge of northern Gaul.
"(Aegidius may also have used the title ""King of the Franks"".)"
"Abuses in tax collection were reformed and the city councils were strengthened, both actions necessary to rebuild the strength of the Empire but disadvantageous to the richest aristocrats."
Majorian prepared a fleet at Carthago Nova for the essential reconquest of the Diocese of Africa.
"The fleet was burned by traitors, and Majorian made peace with the Vandals and returned to Italy."
"Here Ricimer met him, arrested him, and executed him five days later."
Marcellinus in Dalmatia and Aegidius around Soissons in northern Gaul rejected both Ricimer and his puppets and maintained some version of Roman rule in their areas.
Ricimer later ceded Narbo and its hinterland to the Visigoths for their help against Aegidius; this made it impossible for Roman armies to march from Italy to Hispania.
Ricimer was then the effective ruler of Italy (but little else) for several years.
"There is no record of anything significant that he even tried to achieve, he was never acknowledged by the East whose help Ricimer needed, and he died conveniently in 465."
"He arrived in Italy with an army, supported by Marcellinus and his fleet; he married his daughter to Ricimer, and he was proclaimed Augustus in 467."
"In 468, at vast expense, the Eastern empire assembled an enormous force to help the West retake the Diocese of Africa."
"Marcellinus rapidly drove the Vandals from Sardinia and Sicily, and a land invasion evicted them from Tripolitania."
The commander in chief with the main force defeated a Vandal fleet near Sicily and landed at Cape Bon.
"Here Genseric offered to surrender, if he could have a five-day truce to prepare the process."
"He used the respite to prepare a full-scale attack preceded by fireships, which destroyed most of the Roman fleet and killed many of its soldiers."
The Vandals were confirmed in their possession of the Diocese of Africa and they retook Sardinia and Sicily.
"Marcellinus was murdered, possibly on orders from Ricimer."
"The Praetorian prefect of Gaul, Arvandus, tried to persuade the new king of the Visigoths to rebel, on the grounds that Roman power in Gaul was finished anyway, but he refused."
Anthemius was still in command of an army in Italy.
"Additionally, in northern Gaul, a British army led by one Riothamus, operated in imperial interests."
"Anthemius sent his son over the Alps, with an army, to request that the Visigoths return southern Gaul to Roman control."
This would have allowed the Empire land access to Hispania again.
"The Visigoths refused, defeated the forces of both Riothamus and Anthemius, and with the Burgundians took over almost all of the remaining imperial territory in southern Gaul."
"Ricimer then quarreled with Anthemius, and besieged him in Rome, which surrendered in July 472 after more months of starvation."
Anthemius was captured and executed (on Ricimer's orders) by the Burgundian prince Gundobad.
In August Ricimer died of a pulmonary haemorrhage.
"Olybrius, his new emperor, named Gundobad as his patrician, then died himself shortly thereafter."
"He may have made some attempt to intervene in Gaul; if so, it was unsuccessful."
"Orestes fled to the city of Pavia on August 23, 476, where the city's bishop gave him sanctuary."
Orestes was soon forced to flee Pavia when Odoacer's army broke through the city walls and ravaged the city.
"Odoacer's army chased Orestes to Piacenza, where they captured and executed him on August 28, 476."
"On September 4, 476, Odoacer forced then 16-year-old Romulus Augustulus, whom his father Orestes had proclaimed to be Rome's Emperor, to abdicate."
"After deposing Romulus, Odoacer did not execute him."
"The Anonymus Valesianus wrote that Odoacer, ""taking pity on his youth"", spared Romulus' life and granted him an annual pension of 6,000 solidi before sending him to live with relatives in Campania."
"Odoacer then installed himself as ruler over Italy, and sent the Imperial insignia to Constantinople."
"In Roman constitutional theory, the Empire was still simply united under one emperor, implying no abandonment of territorial claims."
"In areas where the convulsions of the dying Empire had made organized self-defence legitimate, rump states continued under some form of Roman rule after 476."
Julius Nepos still claimed to be Emperor of the West and controlled Dalmatia until his murder in 480.
Syagrius son of Aegidius ruled the Domain of Soissons until his murder in 487.
"The indigenous inhabitants of Mauretania developed kingdoms of their own, independent of the Vandals, with strong Roman traits."
"They again sought Imperial recognition with the reconquests of Justinian I, and they put up effective resistance to the Muslim conquest of the Maghreb."
"While the civitates of Britannia sank into a level of material development inferior even to their pre-Roman Iron Age ancestors, they maintained identifiably Roman traits for some time, and they continued to look to their own defence as Honorius had authorized."
"Odoacer began to negotiate with the East Roman (Byzantine) Emperor Zeno, who was busy dealing with unrest in the East."
Zeno eventually granted Odoacer the status of patrician and accepted him as his own viceroy of Italy.
"Zeno, however, insisted that Odoacer had to pay homage to Julius Nepos as the Emperor of the Western Empire."
"Odoacer never returned any territory or real power, but he did issue coins in the name of Julius Nepos throughout Italy."
"In 488 the Eastern emperor authorized a troublesome Goth, Theoderic (later known as ""the Great"") to take Italy."
"After several indecisive campaigns, in 493 Theoderic and Odoacer agreed to rule jointly."
It was also the combined and elaborated civilization of the Mediterranean basin and beyond.
"It included manufacture, trade, and architecture, widespread secular literacy, written law, and an international language of science and literature."
"In this broad sense, a civilization contrasts with non-centralized tribal societies, including the cultures of nomadic pastoralists, Neolithic societies or hunter-gatherers, however sometimes it also contrasts with the cultures found within civilizations themselves."
"Civilizations are organized densely-populated settlements divided into  hierarchical social classes with a ruling elite and subordinate urban and rural populations, which engage in intensive agriculture, mining, small-scale manufacture and trade."
"The earliest emergence of civilizations is generally connected with the final stages of the Neolithic Revolution, culminating in the relatively rapid process of urban revolution and  state-formation, a political development associated with the appearance of a governing elite."
"The word was therefore opposed to barbarism or rudeness, in the active pursuit of progress characteristic of the Age of Enlightenment."
"In the late 1700s and early 1800s, during the French Revolution, ""civilization"" was used in the singular, never in the plural, and meant the progress of humanity as a whole."
"The use of ""civilizations"" as a countable noun was in occasional use in the 19th century, but has become much more common in the later 20th century, sometimes just meaning culture (itself in origin an uncountable noun, made countable in the context of ethnography)."
"Only in this generalized sense does it become possible to speak of a ""medieval civilization"", which in Elias's sense would have been an oxymoron."
"Already in the 18th century, civilization was not always seen as an improvement."
"One historically important distinction between culture and civilization is from the writings of Rousseau, particularly his work about education, Emile."
"Here, civilization, being more rational and socially driven, is not fully in accord with human nature, and ""human wholeness is achievable only through the recovery of or approximation to an original discursive or prerational natural unity"" (see noble savage)."
"From this, a new approach was developed, especially in Germany, first by Johann Gottfried Herder and later by philosophers such as Kierkegaard and Nietzsche."
"This sees cultures as natural organisms, not defined by ""conscious, rational, deliberative acts"", but a kind of pre-rational ""folk spirit""."
"Civilization, in contrast, though more rational and more successful in material progress, is unnatural and leads to ""vices of social life"" such as guile, hypocrisy, envy and avarice."
"In World War II, Leo Strauss, having fled Germany, argued in New York that this opinion of civilization was behind Nazism and German militarism and nihilism."
"Civilizations have been distinguished by their means of subsistence, types of livelihood, settlement patterns, forms of government, social stratification, economic systems, literacy and other cultural traits."
"Andrew Nikiforuk argues that ""civilizations relied on shackled human muscle."
"Grain farms can result in accumulated storage and a surplus of food, particularly when people use intensive agricultural techniques such as artificial fertilization, irrigation and crop rotation."
"It is possible but more difficult to accumulate horticultural production, and so civilizations based on horticultural gardening have been very rare."
Grain surpluses have been especially important because grain can be stored for a long time.
"A surplus of food permits some people to do things besides producing food for a living: early civilizations included soldiers, artisans, priests and priestesses, and other people with specialized careers."
"A surplus of food results in a division of labour and a more diverse range of human activity, a defining trait of civilizations."
"However, in some places hunter-gatherers have had access to food surpluses, such as among some of the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest and perhaps during the Mesolithic Natufian culture."
"The word ""civilization"" is sometimes simply defined as ""'living in cities'""."
Non-farmers tend to gather in cities to work and to trade.
"Compared with other societies, civilizations have a more complex political structure, namely the state."
State societies are more stratified than other societies; there is a greater difference among the social classes.
"The ruling class, normally concentrated in the cities, has control over much of the surplus and exercises its will through the actions of a government or bureaucracy."
"Morton Fried, a conflict theorist and Elman Service, an integration theorist, have classified human cultures based on political systems and social inequality."
Horticultural/pastoral societies in which there are generally two inherited social classes; chief and commoner.
"Highly stratified structures, or chiefdoms, with several inherited social classes: king, noble, freemen, serf and slave."
Living in one place allows people to accumulate more personal possessions than nomadic people.
"Some people also acquire landed property, or private ownership of the land."
"Because a percentage of people in civilizations do not grow their own food, they must trade their goods and services for food in a market system, or receive food through the levy of tribute, redistributive taxation, tariffs or tithes from the food producing segment of the population."
Early human cultures functioned through a gift economy supplemented by limited barter systems.
"By the early Iron Age, contemporary civilizations developed money as a medium of exchange for increasingly complex transactions."
"In a village, the potter makes a pot for the brewer and the brewer compensates the potter by giving him a certain amount of beer."
"In a city, the potter may need a new roof, the roofer may need new shoes, the cobbler may need new horseshoes, the blacksmith may need a new coat and the tanner may need a new pot."
These people may not be personally acquainted with one another and their needs may not occur all at the same time.
A monetary system is a way of organizing these obligations to ensure that they are fulfilled.
"From the days of the earliest monetarized civilizations, monopolistic controls of monetary systems have benefited the social and political elites."
"Writing, developed first by people in Sumer, is considered a hallmark of civilization and ""appears to accompany the rise of complex administrative bureaucracies or the conquest state""."
Traders and bureaucrats relied on writing to keep accurate records.
"Like money, the writing was necessitated by the size of the population of a city and the complexity of its commerce among people who are not all personally acquainted with each other."
"However, writing is not always necessary for civilization, as shown by the Inca civilization of the Andes, which did not use writing at all but except for a complex recording system consisting of cords and nodes: the ""Quipus"", and still functioned as a civilized society."
"Aided by their division of labour and central government planning, civilizations have developed many other diverse cultural traits."
"These include organized religion, development in the arts, and countless new advances in science and technology."
"Through history, successful civilizations have spread, taking over more and more territory, and assimilating more and more previously-uncivilized people."
"Nevertheless, some tribes or people remain uncivilized even to this day."
"These cultures are called by some ""primitive"", a term that is regarded by others as pejorative."
"Specifically, as all of today's cultures are contemporaries, today's so-called primitive cultures are in no way antecedent to those we consider civilized."
"Anthropologists today use the term ""non-literate"" to describe these peoples."
"Civilization has been spread by colonization, invasion, religious conversion, the extension of bureaucratic control and trade, and by introducing agriculture and writing to non-literate peoples."
Some non-civilized people may willingly adapt to civilized behaviour.
"But civilization is also spread by the technical, material and social dominance that civilization engenders."
"Assessments of what level of civilization a polity has reached are based on comparisons of the relative importance of agricultural as opposed to trading or manufacturing capacities, the territorial extensions of its power, the complexity of its division of labour, and the carrying capacity of its urban centres."
"Secondary elements include a developed transportation system, writing, standardized measurement, currency, contractual and tort-based legal systems, art, architecture, mathematics, scientific understanding, metallurgy, political structures and organized religion."
"Traditionally, polities that managed to achieve notable military, ideological and economic power defined themselves as ""civilized"" as opposed to other societies or human groupings outside their sphere of influence – calling the latter barbarians, savages, and primitives."
"Every society, civilization or not, has a specific set of ideas and customs, and a certain set of manufactures and arts that make it unique."
"Civilizations tend to develop intricate cultures, including a state-based decision making apparatus, a literature, professional art, architecture, organized religion and complex customs of education, coercion and control associated with maintaining the elite."
"The intricate culture associated with civilization has a tendency to spread to and influence other cultures, sometimes assimilating them into the civilization (a classic example being Chinese civilization and its influence on nearby civilizations such as Korea, Japan and Vietnam)."
Many civilizations are actually large cultural spheres containing many nations and regions.
The civilization in which someone lives is that person's broadest cultural identity.
It is precisely the protection of this cultural identity that is becoming increasingly important nationally and internationally.
"According to international law, the United Nations and UNESCO try to set up and enforce relevant rules."
"The aim is to preserve the cultural heritage of humanity and also the cultural identity, especially in the case of war and armed conflict."
"According to Karl von Habsburg, President of Blue Shield International, the destruction of cultural assets is also part of psychological warfare."
"The target of the attack is often the opponent's cultural identity, which is why symbolic cultural assets become a main target."
"Early twentieth-century philosopher Oswald Spengler, uses the German word Kultur, ""culture"", for what many call a ""civilization""."
Spengler believed a civilization's coherence is based on a single primary cultural symbol.
"Cultures experience cycles of birth, life, decline and death, often supplanted by a potent new culture, formed around a compelling new cultural symbol."
"Toynbee explored civilization processes in his multi-volume A Study of History, which traced the rise and, in most cases, the decline of 21 civilizations and five ""arrested civilizations""."
"Civilizations generally declined and fell, according to Toynbee, because of the failure of a ""creative minority"", through moral or religious decline, to meet some important challenge, rather than mere economic or environmental causes."
Huntington's theories about civilizations are discussed below.
"Civilizations can be seen as networks of cities that emerge from pre-urban cultures and are defined by the economic, political, military, diplomatic, social and cultural interactions among them."
Any organization is a complex social system and a civilization is a large organization.
Systems theory helps guard against superficial and misleading analogies in the study and description of civilizations.
"Systems theorists look at many types of relations between cities, including economic relations, cultural exchanges and political/diplomatic/military relations."
These spheres often occur on different scales.
"For example, trade networks were, until the nineteenth century, much larger than either cultural spheres or political spheres."
"Extensive trade routes, including the Silk Road through Central Asia and Indian Ocean sea routes linking the Roman Empire, Persian Empire, India and China, were well established 2000 years ago when these civilizations scarcely shared any political, diplomatic, military, or cultural relations."
The first evidence of such long-distance trade is in the ancient world.
"During the Uruk period, Guillermo Algaze has argued that trade relations connected Egypt, Mesopotamia, Iran and Afghanistan."
Resin found later in the Royal Cemetery at Ur is suggested was traded northwards from Mozambique.
"Many theorists argue that the entire world has already become integrated into a single ""world system"", a process known as globalization."
"Different civilizations and societies all over the globe are economically, politically, and even culturally interdependent in many ways."
"There is debate over when this integration began, and what sort of integration – cultural, technological, economic, political, or military-diplomatic – is the key indicator in determining the extent of a civilization."
"David Wilkinson has proposed that economic and military-diplomatic integration of the Mesopotamian and Egyptian civilizations resulted in the creation of what he calls the ""Central Civilization"" around 1500 BCE."
"Central Civilization later expanded to include the entire Middle East and Europe, and then expanded to a global scale with European colonization, integrating the Americas, Australia, China and Japan by the nineteenth century."
"According to Wilkinson, civilizations can be culturally heterogeneous, like the Central Civilization, or homogeneous, like the Japanese civilization."
"What Huntington calls the ""clash of civilizations"" might be characterized by Wilkinson as a clash of cultural spheres within a single global civilization."
Others point to the Crusades as the first step in globalization.
"The more conventional viewpoint is that networks of societies have expanded and shrunk since ancient times, and that the current globalized economy and culture is a product of recent European colonialism."
"In the European Age of Discovery, emerging Modernity was put into stark contrast with the Neolithic and Mesolithic  stage of the cultures of many of the peoples they encountered."
"The term ""civilization"" as it is now most commonly understood, a complex state with centralization,  social stratification and specialization of labour, corresponds to early empires that arise in the Fertile Crescent in the Early Bronze Age, around roughly 3000 BC."
"Gordon Childe defined the emergence of civilization as the result of two successive revolutions: the Neolithic Revolution, triggering the development of settled communities, and the Urban Revolution."
"In major semi-arid river valleys, annual flooding renewed soil fertility every year, with the result that population densities could rise significantly."
"Mesopotamia is the site of the earliest developments of the Neolithic Revolution from around 10,000 BCE, with civilizations developing from 6,500 years ago."
"This area has been identified as having ""inspired some of the most important developments in human history including the invention of the wheel, the planting of the first cereal crops and the development of the cursive script."""
"This climate change shifted the cost-benefit ratio of endemic violence between communities, which saw the abandonment of unwalled village communities and the appearance of walled cities, associated with the first civilizations."
"This ""urban revolution"" marked the beginning of the accumulation of transferable surpluses, which helped economies and cities develop."
A parallel development took place independently in the Pre-Columbian Americas.
"Urbanization in the Norte Chico civilization in coastal Peru emerged about 3200 BCE; the oldest known Mayan city, located in Guatemala, dates to about 750 BCE."
"and Teotihuacan in Mexico was one of the largest cities in the world in 350 CE with a population of about 125,000."
This view has recently been championed by Christopher Chase-Dunn and other world systems theorists.
"Some focus on historical examples, and others on general theory."
"Ibn Khaldūn's Muqaddimah influenced theories of the analysis, growth and decline of the Islamic civilization."
He suggested repeated invasions from nomadic peoples limited development and led to social collapse.
Edward Gibbon's work The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire was a well-known and detailed analysis of the fall of Roman civilization.
"For Gibbon, ""The decline of Rome was the natural and inevitable effect of immoderate greatness."
"Prosperity ripened the principle of decay; the cause of the destruction multiplied with the extent of conquest; and, as soon as time or accident had removed the artificial supports, the stupendous fabric yielded to the pressure of its own weight."
"The story of the ruin is simple and obvious; and instead of inquiring why the Roman Empire was destroyed, we should rather be surprised that it has subsisted for so long""."
"Oswald Spengler, in his Decline of the West rejected Petrarch's chronological division, and suggested that there had been only eight ""mature civilizations""."
"Growing cultures, he argued, tend to develop into imperialistic civilizations, which expand and ultimately collapse, with democratic forms of government ushering in plutocracy and ultimately imperialism."
"The cause of the fall of a civilization occurred when a cultural elite became a parasitic elite, leading to the rise of internal and external proletariats."
"Joseph Tainter in The Collapse of Complex Societies suggested that there were diminishing returns to complexity, due to which, as states achieved a maximum permissible complexity, they would decline when further increases actually produced a negative return."
"Jared Diamond in his 2005 book Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed suggests five major reasons for the collapse of 41 studied cultures: environmental damage, such as deforestation and soil erosion; climate change; dependence upon long-distance trade for needed resources; increasing levels of internal and external violence, such as war or invasion; and societal responses to internal and environmental problems."
"in their Introduction to Social Macrodynamics, Secular Cycles, and Millennial Trends suggest a number of mathematical models describing collapse of agrarian civilizations."
"For example, the basic logic of Turchin's ""fiscal-demographic"" model can be outlined as follows: during the initial phase of a sociodemographic cycle we observe relatively high levels of per capita production and consumption, which leads not only to relatively high population growth rates, but also to relatively high rates of surplus production."
"As a result, during this phase the population can afford to pay taxes without great problems, the taxes are quite easily collectible, and the population growth is accompanied by the growth of state revenues."
"During the intermediate phase, the increasing overpopulation leads to the decrease of per capita production and consumption levels, it becomes more and more difficult to collect taxes, and state revenues stop growing, whereas the state expenditures grow due to the growth of the population controlled by the state."
"As a result, during this phase the state starts experiencing considerable fiscal problems."
"During the final pre-collapse phases the overpopulation leads to further decrease of per capita production, the surplus production further decreases, state revenues shrink, but the state needs more and more resources to control the growing (though with lower and lower rates) population."
"Eventually this leads to famines, epidemics, state breakdown, and demographic and civilization collapse (Peter Turchin."
"Peter Heather argues in his book The Fall of the Roman Empire: a New History of Rome and the Barbarians that this civilization did not end for moral or economic reasons, but because centuries of contact with barbarians across the frontier generated its own nemesis by making them a more sophisticated and dangerous adversary."
"The fact that Rome needed to generate ever greater revenues to equip and re-equip armies that were for the first time repeatedly defeated in the field, led to the dismemberment of the Empire."
"Although this argument is specific to Rome, it can also be applied to the Asiatic Empire of the Egyptians, to the Han and Tang dynasties of China, to the Muslim Abbasid Caliphate and others."
"Bryan Ward-Perkins, in his book The Fall of Rome and the End of Civilization, argues from mostly archaeological evidence that the collapse of Roman civilization in western Europe had deleterious impacts on the living standards of the population, unlike some historians who downplay this."
"The collapse of complex society meant that even basic plumbing for the elite disappeared from the continent for 1,000 years."
"Similar impacts have been postulated for the Dark Age after the Late Bronze Age collapse in the Eastern Mediterranean, the collapse of the Maya, on Easter Island and elsewhere."
"Arthur Demarest argues in Ancient Maya: The Rise and Fall of a Rainforest Civilization, using a holistic perspective to the most recent evidence from archeology, paleoecology, and epigraphy, that no one explanation is sufficient but that a series of erratic, complex events, including loss of soil fertility, drought and rising levels of internal and external violence led to the disintegration of the courts of Mayan kingdoms, which began a spiral of decline and decay."
He argues that the collapse of the Maya has lessons for civilization today.
"Thomas Homer-Dixon in The Upside of Down: Catastrophe, Creativity, and the Renewal of Civilization, where he considers that the fall in the energy return on investments."
The energy expended to energy yield ratio is central to limiting the survival of civilizations.
"The degree of social complexity is associated strongly, he suggests, with the amount of disposable energy environmental, economic and technological systems allow."
When this amount decreases civilizations either have to access new energy sources or they will collapse.
"Feliks Koneczny in his work ""On the Plurality of Civilizations""  calls his study the science on civilizations."
"Civilizations fall not because they must or there exist some cyclical or a ""biological"" life span."
There still exist two ancient civilizations – Brahmin-Hindu and Chinese – which are not ready to fall any time soon.
"Koneczny claimed that civilizations cannot be mixed into hybrids, an inferior civilization when given equal rights within a highly developed civilization will overcome it."
"One of Koneczny's claims in his study on civilizations is that ""a person cannot be civilized in two or more ways"" without falling into what he calls an ""abcivilized state"" (as in abnormal)."
"He also stated that when two or more civilizations exist next to one another and as long as they are vital, they will be in an existential combat imposing its own ""method of organizing social life"" upon the other."
"Absorbing alien ""method of organizing social life"" that is civilization and giving it equal rights yields a process of decay and decomposition."
"According to Huntington, conflicts between civilizations will supplant the conflicts between nation-states and ideologies that characterized the 19th and 20th centuries."
"In Identity and Violence Sen questions if people should be divided along the lines of a supposed ""civilization"", defined by religion and culture only."
He argues that this ignores the many others identities that make up people and leads to a focus on differences.
"Cultural Historian Morris Berman suggests in Dark Ages America: the End of Empire that in the corporate consumerist United States, the very factors that once propelled it to greatness―extreme individualism, territorial and economic expansion, and the pursuit of material wealth―have pushed the United States across a critical threshold where collapse is inevitable."
"Politically associated with over-reach, and as a result of the environmental exhaustion and polarization of wealth between rich and poor, he concludes the current system is fast arriving at a situation where continuation of the existing system saddled with huge deficits and a hollowed-out economy is physically, socially, economically and politically impossible."
"Although developed in much more depth, Berman's thesis is similar in some ways to that of Urban Planner, Jane Jacobs who argues that the five pillars of United States culture are in serious decay: community and family; higher education; the effective practice of science; taxation and government; and the self-regulation of the learned professions."
"This need for civilizations to import ever more resources, he argues, stems from their over-exploitation and diminution of their own local resources."
"Therefore, civilizations inherently adopt imperialist and expansionist policies and, to maintain these, highly militarized, hierarchically structured, and coercion-based cultures and lifestyles."
"The Kardashev scale classifies civilizations based on their level of technological advancement, specifically measured by the amount of energy a civilization is able to harness."
"The scale is only hypothetical, but it puts energy consumption in a cosmic perspective."
The Kardashev scale makes provisions for civilizations far more technologically advanced than any currently known to exist.
"A recent thought experiment, however, has considered whether it would ""be possible to detect an industrial civilization in the geological record"" given the paucity of geological information about eras before the quaternary."
"The British Empire was composed of the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states."
It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries.
"At its height it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power."
"As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread."
"Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia."
"A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left England (Britain, following the 1707 Act of Union with Scotland) the dominant colonial power in North America."
Britain became the dominant power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757.
The American War of Independence resulted in Britain losing some of its oldest and most populous colonies in North America by 1783.
"British attention turned towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific."
"Alongside the formal control that Britain exerted over its colonies, its dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America."
"Increasing degrees of autonomy were granted to its white settler colonies, some of which were reclassified as dominions."
"By the start of the 20th century, Germany and the United States had begun to challenge Britain's economic lead."
"Military and economic tensions between Britain and Germany were major causes of the First World War, during which Britain relied heavily on its empire."
"The conflict placed enormous strain on its military, financial, and manpower resources."
"Although the empire achieved its largest territorial extent immediately after World War I, Britain was no longer the world's pre-eminent industrial or military power."
"In the Second World War, Britain's colonies in East and Southeast Asia were occupied by Japan."
"Despite the final victory of Britain and its allies, the damage to British prestige helped to accelerate the decline of the empire."
"India, Britain's most valuable and populous possession, achieved independence as part of a larger decolonisation movement in which Britain granted independence to most territories of the empire."
"The Suez Crisis confirmed Britain's decline as a global power, and the transfer of Hong Kong to China in 1997 marked for many the end of the British Empire."
Fourteen overseas territories remain under British sovereignty.
"After independence, many former British colonies joined the Commonwealth of Nations, a free association of independent states."
"16 of these, including the United Kingdom, retain a common monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II."
"In 1496, King Henry VII of England, following the successes of Spain and Portugal in overseas exploration, commissioned John Cabot to lead a voyage to discover a route to Asia via the North Atlantic."
"In the meantime, the 1533 Statute in Restraint of Appeals had declared ""that this realm of England is an Empire""."
The Protestant Reformation turned England and Catholic Spain into implacable enemies.
"In 1562, the English Crown encouraged the privateers John Hawkins and Francis Drake to engage in slave-raiding attacks against Spanish and Portuguese ships off the coast of West Africa with the aim of breaking into the Atlantic slave trade."
"This effort was rebuffed and later, as the Anglo-Spanish Wars intensified, Elizabeth I gave her blessing to further privateering raids against Spanish ports in the Americas and shipping that was returning across the Atlantic, laden with treasure from the New World."
"At the same time, influential writers such as Richard Hakluyt and John Dee (who was the first to use the term ""British Empire"") were beginning to press for the establishment of England's own empire."
"Several people who helped establish colonies in Ireland also later played a part in the early colonisation of North America, particularly a group known as the West Country men."
"That year, Gilbert sailed for the Caribbean with the intention of engaging in piracy and establishing a colony in North America, but the expedition was aborted before it had crossed the Atlantic."
"On this occasion he formally claimed the harbour of the island of Newfoundland, although no settlers were left behind."
"Gilbert did not survive the return journey to England, and was succeeded by his half-brother, Walter Raleigh, who was granted his own patent by Elizabeth in 1584."
"Now at peace with its main rival, English attention shifted from preying on other nations' colonial infrastructures to the business of establishing its own overseas colonies."
"The British Empire began to take shape during the early 17th century, with the English settlement of North America and the smaller islands of the Caribbean, and the establishment of joint-stock companies, most notably the East India Company, to administer colonies and overseas trade."
"This period, until the loss of the Thirteen Colonies after the American War of Independence towards the end of the 18th century, has been referred to by some historians as the ""First British Empire""."
"An attempt to establish a colony in Guiana in 1604 lasted only two years, and failed in its main objective to find gold deposits."
"The colonies soon adopted the system of sugar plantations successfully used by the Portuguese in Brazil, which depended on slave labour, and—at first—Dutch ships, to sell the slaves and buy the sugar."
"To ensure that the increasingly healthy profits of this trade remained in English hands, Parliament decreed in 1651 that only English ships would be able to ply their trade in English colonies."
This led to hostilities with the United Dutch Provinces—a series of Anglo-Dutch Wars—which would eventually strengthen England's position in the Americas at the expense of the Dutch.
"The London and Bristol Company was created in 1610 with the aim of creating a permanent settlement on Newfoundland, but was largely unsuccessful."
"In 1620, Plymouth was founded as a haven for Puritan religious separatists, later known as the Pilgrims."
"Fleeing from religious persecution would become the motive of many English would-be colonists to risk the arduous trans-Atlantic voyage: Maryland was founded as a haven for Roman Catholics (1634), Rhode Island (1636) as a colony tolerant of all religions and Connecticut (1639) for Congregationalists."
"This was formalised in negotiations following the Second Anglo-Dutch War, in exchange for Suriname."
"In 1681, the colony of Pennsylvania was founded by William Penn."
"The American colonies were less financially successful than those of the Caribbean, but had large areas of good agricultural land and attracted far larger numbers of English emigrants who preferred their temperate climates."
"In 1670, Charles II incorporated by royal charter the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC), granting it a monopoly on the fur trade in the area known as Rupert's Land, which would later form a large proportion of the Dominion of Canada."
"From the outset, slavery was the basis of the Empire in the West Indies."
"To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island."
"In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies)."
"For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol, Glasgow and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the triangular trade with Africa and the Americas."
"For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven."
"The primary aim of these companies was to tap into the lucrative spice trade, an effort focused mainly on two regions; the East Indies archipelago, and an important hub in the trade network, India."
"There, they competed for trade supremacy with Portugal and with each other."
"Although England eclipsed the Netherlands as a colonial power, in the short term the Netherlands' more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left it with a stronger position in Asia."
"Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 when the Dutch William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England."
"In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted for thirteen years."
"Besieged by neighbouring Spanish colonists of New Granada, and afflicted by malaria, the colony was abandoned two years later."
The Darien scheme was a financial disaster for Scotland—a quarter of Scottish capital was lost in the enterprise—and ended Scottish hopes of establishing its own overseas empire.
"The episode also had major political consequences, helping to persuade the government of Scotland of the merits of a union of the two countries, rather than just crowns."
"Philip V of Spain renounced his and his descendants' claim to the French throne, and Spain lost its empire in Europe."
"The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain Gibraltar and Menorca."
Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.
Spain also ceded the rights to the lucrative asiento (permission to sell African slaves in Spanish America) to Britain.
"With the outbreak of the Anglo-Spanish War of Jenkins' Ear in 1739, Spanish privateers attacked British merchant shipping along the Triangle Trade routes."
"In 1746, the Spanish and British began peace talks, with the King of Spain agreeing to stop all attacks on British shipping; however, in the Treaty of Madrid Britain lost its slave trading rights in South and Central America."
"In the East Indies, British and Dutch merchants continued to compete in spices and textiles."
"France was left control of its enclaves but with military restrictions and an obligation to support British client states, ending French hopes of controlling India."
"In the following decades the British East India Company gradually increased the size of the territories under its control, either ruling directly or via local rulers under the threat of force from the Presidency Armies, the vast majority of which was composed of Indian sepoys, led by British officers."
"In North America, France's future as a colonial power effectively ended with the recognition of British claims to Rupert's Land, and the ceding of New France to Britain (leaving a sizeable French-speaking population under British control) and Louisiana to Spain."
Spain ceded Florida to Britain.
"Along with its victory over France in India, the Seven Years' War therefore left Britain as the world's most powerful maritime power."
"This was summarised at the time by the slogan ""No taxation without representation"", a perceived violation of the guaranteed Rights of Englishmen."
The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government.
"In response, Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775."
"The entry of French and Spanish forces into the war tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms."
"Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations, published in 1776, had argued that colonies were redundant, and that free trade should replace the old mercantilist policies that had characterised the first period of colonial expansion, dating back to the protectionism of Spain and Portugal."
"The US declared war, the War of 1812, and invaded Canadian territory."
"In response Britain invaded the US, but the pre-war boundaries were reaffirmed by the 1814 Treaty of Ghent, ensuring Canada's future would be separate from that of the United States."
"Forced to find an alternative location after the loss of the Thirteen Colonies in 1783, the British government turned to Australia."
"The coast of Australia had been discovered for Europeans by the Dutch in 1606, but there was no attempt to colonise it."
"Indigenous Australians were considered too uncivilised to require treaties, and colonisation brought disease and violence that together with the deliberate dispossession of land and culture were devastating to these peoples."
"Britain continued to transport convicts to New South Wales until 1840, to Tasmania until 1853 and to Western Australia until 1868."
"Initially, interaction between the indigenous Māori population and Europeans was limited to the trading of goods."
"European settlement increased through the early decades of the 19th century, with numerous trading stations established, especially in the North."
"In 1839, the New Zealand Company announced plans to buy large tracts of land and establish colonies in New Zealand."
"On 6 February 1840, Captain William Hobson and around 40 Maori chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi."
"This treaty is considered to be New Zealand's founding document, but differing interpretations of the Maori and English versions of the text have meant that it continues to be a source of dispute."
"Britain was again the beneficiary of peace treaties: France ceded the Ionian Islands, Malta (which it had occupied in 1797 and 1798 respectively), Mauritius, Saint Lucia, Seychelles, and Tobago; Spain ceded Trinidad; the Netherlands Guyana, and the Cape Colony."
"Britain returned Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Guiana, and Réunion to France, and Java and Suriname to the Netherlands, while gaining control of Ceylon (1795–1815) and  Heligoland."
Added to this was the cost of suppressing regular slave rebellions.
"With support from the British abolitionist movement, Parliament enacted the Slave Trade Act in 1807, which abolished the slave trade in the empire."
"In 1808, Sierra Leone Colony was designated an official British colony for freed slaves."
Parliamentary reform in 1832 saw the influence of the West India Committee decline.
"The Slavery Abolition Act, passed the following year, abolished slavery in the British Empire on 1 August 1834, finally bringing the Empire into line with the law in the UK (with the exception of the territories administered by the East India Company and Ceylon, where slavery was ended in 1844)."
"Under the Act, slaves were granted full emancipation after a period of four to six years of ""apprenticeship""."
The British government compensated slave-owners.
"Victory over Napoleon left Britain without any serious international rival, other than Russia in Central Asia."
"Unchallenged at sea, Britain adopted the role of global policeman, a state of affairs later known as the Pax Britannica, and a foreign policy of ""splendid isolation""."
"Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, Britain's dominant position in world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many countries, such as China, Argentina and Siam, which has been described by some historians as an ""Informal Empire""."
"British imperial strength was underpinned by the steamship and the telegraph, new technologies invented in the second half of the 19th century, allowing it to control and defend the empire."
"By 1902, the British Empire was linked together by a network of telegraph cables, called the All Red Line."
"This trade, illegal since it was outlawed by the Qing dynasty in 1729, helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from the British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China."
"A series of Acts of Parliament were passed, including the Regulating Act of 1773, Pitt's India Act of 1784 and the Charter Act of 1813 which regulated the Company's affairs and established the sovereignty of the Crown over the territories that it had acquired."
"The Company's eventual end was precipitated by the Indian Rebellion in 1857, a conflict that had begun with the mutiny of sepoys, Indian troops under British officers and discipline."
"The rebellion took six months to suppress, with heavy loss of life on both sides."
"The following year the British government dissolved the Company and assumed direct control over India through the Government of India Act 1858, establishing the British Raj, where an appointed governor-general administered India and Queen Victoria was crowned the Empress of India."
The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule.
"Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect."
"This rivalry in Central Asia came to be known as the ""Great Game""."
"As far as Britain was concerned, defeats inflicted by Russia on Persia and Turkey demonstrated its imperial ambitions and capabilities and stoked fears in Britain of an overland invasion of India."
"The ensuing Crimean War (1854–1856), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica and was a resounding defeat for Russia."
"The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan."
"For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente."
The destruction of the Russian Navy by the Japanese at the Battle of Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905 also limited its threat to the British.
"Britain formally acquired the colony, and its large Afrikaner (or Boer) population in 1806, having occupied it in 1795 to prevent its falling into French hands during the Flanders Campaign."
"British immigration began to rise after 1820, and pushed thousands of Boers, resentful of British rule, northwards to found their own—mostly short-lived—independent republics, during the Great Trek of the late 1830s and early 1840s."
"In the process the Voortrekkers clashed repeatedly with the British, who had their own agenda with regard to colonial expansion in South Africa and to the various native African polities, including those of the Sotho and the Zulu nations."
Eventually the Boers established two republics which had a longer lifespan: the South African Republic or Transvaal Republic (1852–1877; 1881–1902) and the Orange Free State (1854–1902).
"Initially the Canal was opposed by the British; but once opened, its strategic value was quickly recognised and became the ""jugular vein of the Empire""."
"In 1875, the Conservative government of Benjamin Disraeli bought the indebted Egyptian ruler Isma'il Pasha's 44% shareholding in the Suez Canal for £4 million (equivalent to £380 million in 2019)."
"Although this did not grant outright control of the strategic waterway, it did give Britain leverage."
"Although Britain controlled Egypt into the 20th century, it was officially part of the Ottoman Empire and not part of the British Empire."
"The scramble continued into the 1890s, and caused Britain to reconsider its decision in 1885 to withdraw from Sudan."
"A joint force of British and Egyptian troops defeated the Mahdist Army in 1896, and rebuffed an attempted French invasion at Fashoda in 1898."
"During the 1880s and 1890s, Rhodes, with his privately owned British South Africa Company, occupied and annexed territories named after him, Rhodesia."
"This began with the passing of the Act of Union in 1840, which created the Province of Canada."
"Ireland had been united with Britain into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland with the Act of Union 1800 after the Irish Rebellion of 1798, and had suffered a severe famine between 1845 and 1852."
"Home rule was supported by the British Prime minister, William Gladstone, who hoped that Ireland might follow in Canada's footsteps as a Dominion within the empire, but his 1886 Home Rule bill was defeated in Parliament."
"Although the bill, if passed, would have granted Ireland less autonomy within the UK than the Canadian provinces had within their own federation, many MPs feared that a partially independent Ireland might pose a security threat to Great Britain or mark the beginning of the break-up of the empire."
A second Home Rule bill was also defeated for similar reasons.
"A third bill was passed by Parliament in 1914, but not implemented because of the outbreak of the First World War leading to the 1916 Easter Rising."
Germany was rapidly rising as a military and industrial power and was now seen as the most likely opponent in any future war.
"Recognising that it was overstretched in the Pacific and threatened at home by the Imperial German Navy, Britain formed an alliance with Japan in 1902 and with its old enemies France and Russia in 1904 and 1907, respectively."
Britain quickly invaded and occupied most of Germany's overseas colonies in Africa.
"In the Pacific, Australia and New Zealand occupied German New Guinea and German Samoa respectively."
"Plans for a post-war division of the Ottoman Empire, which had joined the war on Germany's side, were secretly drawn up by Britain and France under the 1916 Sykes–Picot Agreement."
"The contributions of Australian and New Zealand troops during the 1915 Gallipoli Campaign against the Ottoman Empire had a great impact on the national consciousness at home, and marked a watershed in the transition of Australia and New Zealand from colonies to nations in their own right."
The countries continue to commemorate this occasion on Anzac Day.
Canadians viewed the Battle of Vimy Ridge in a similar light.
The colonies of Germany and the Ottoman Empire were distributed to the Allied powers as League of Nations mandates.
"Britain gained control of Palestine, Transjordan, Iraq, parts of Cameroon and Togoland, and Tanganyika."
"The Dominions themselves also acquired mandates of their own: the Union of South Africa gained South West Africa (modern-day Namibia), Australia gained New Guinea, and New Zealand Western Samoa."
Nauru was made a combined mandate of Britain and the two Pacific Dominions.
"Forced to choose between alignment with the United States or Japan, Britain opted not to renew its Japanese alliance and instead signed the 1922 Washington Naval Treaty, where Britain accepted naval parity with the United States."
"This decision was the source of much debate in Britain during the 1930s as militaristic governments took hold in Germany and Japan helped in part by the Great Depression, for it was feared that the empire could not survive a simultaneous attack by both nations."
The Irish Republican Army simultaneously began a guerrilla war against the British administration.
"The Anglo-Irish War ended in 1921 with a stalemate and the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty, creating the Irish Free State, a Dominion within the British Empire, with effective internal independence but still constitutionally linked with the British Crown."
"Northern Ireland, consisting of six of the 32 Irish counties which had been established as a devolved region under the 1920 Government of Ireland Act, immediately exercised its option under the treaty to retain its existing status within the United Kingdom."
A similar struggle began in India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence.
Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts.
"This led to tension, particularly in the Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre."
"In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, between those who saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion."
"British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone."
"In return, Egypt was assisted in joining the League of Nations."
"Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932."
"In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arabs and increasing numbers of Jews."
"The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power."
"Britain's request for military assistance from the Dominions at the outbreak of the Chanak Crisis the previous year had been turned down by Canada and South Africa, and Canada had refused to be bound by the 1923 Treaty of Lausanne."
This declaration was given legal substance under the 1931 Statute of Westminster.
"The parliaments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand, the Union of South Africa, the Irish Free State and Newfoundland were now independent of British legislative control, they could nullify British laws and Britain could no longer pass laws for them without their consent."
"Newfoundland reverted to colonial status in 1933, suffering from financial difficulties during the Great Depression."
In 1937 the Irish Free State introduced a republican constitution renaming itself Ireland.
"In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that ""the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live"" should be respected."
"He felt that Britain was now assured of victory, but failed to recognise that the ""many disasters, immeasurable costs and tribulations [which he knew] lay ahead"" in December 1941 would have permanent consequences for the future of the empire."
"The manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power, including, particularly, the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar."
"The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States and, ultimately, the 1951 ANZUS Pact."
"The war weakened the empire in other ways: undermining Britain's control of politics in India, inflicting long term economic damage, and irrevocably changing geopolitics by pushing the Soviet Union and the United States to the centre of the global stage."
"Much of Europe, a continent that had dominated the world for several centuries, was in ruins, and host to the armies of the United States and the Soviet Union, who now held the balance of global power."
"At the same time, anti-colonial movements were on the rise in the colonies of European nations."
The situation was complicated further by the increasing Cold War rivalry of the United States and the Soviet Union.
"In principle, both nations were opposed to European colonialism."
"In practice, American anti-communism prevailed over anti-imperialism, and therefore the United States supported the continued existence of the British Empire to keep Communist expansion in check."
"At first British politicians believed it would be possible to maintain Britain's role as a world power at the head of a re-imagined Commonwealth, but by 1960 they were forced to recognise that there was an irresistible ""wind of change"" blowing."
"Their priorities changed to maintaining an extensive zone of British influence and ensuring that stable, non-Communist governments were established in former colonies."
"In this context, while other European powers such as France and Portugal, waged costly and unsuccessful wars to keep their empires intact, Britain generally adopted a policy of peaceful disengagement from its colonies."
"Between 1945 and 1965, the number of people under British rule outside the UK itself fell from 700 million to 5 million, 3 million of whom were in Hong Kong."
"India's two major political parties—the Indian National Congress (led by Mahatma Gandhi) and the Muslim League (led by Muhammad Ali Jinnah)—had been campaigning for independence for decades, but disagreed as to how it should be implemented."
"Congress favoured a unified secular Indian state, whereas the League, fearing domination by the Hindu majority, desired a separate Islamic state for Muslim-majority regions."
Increasing civil unrest and the mutiny of the Royal Indian Navy during 1946 led Attlee to promise independence no later than 30 June 1948.
"When the urgency of the situation and risk of civil war became apparent, the newly appointed (and last) Viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, hastily brought forward the date to 15 August 1947."
The borders drawn by the British to broadly partition India into Hindu and Muslim areas left tens of millions as minorities in the newly independent states of India and Pakistan.
"Millions of Muslims crossed from India to Pakistan and Hindus vice versa, and violence between the two communities cost hundreds of thousands of lives."
"Burma, which had been administered as part of the British Raj, and Sri Lanka gained their independence the following year in 1948."
"The matter was complicated by large numbers of Jewish refugees seeking to be admitted to Palestine following the Holocaust, while Arabs were opposed to the creation of a Jewish state."
"Frustrated by the intractability of the problem, attacks by Jewish paramilitary organisations and the increasing cost of maintaining its military presence, Britain announced in 1947 that it would withdraw in 1948 and leave the matter to the United Nations to solve."
The UN General Assembly subsequently voted for a plan to partition Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state.
"It was immediately followed by the outbreak of a civil war between the Arabs and Jews of Palestine, and British forces withdrew amid the fighting."
"The British Mandate for Palestine officially terminated at midnight on 15 May 1948 as the State of Israel declared independence and the 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, during which the territory of the former Mandate was partitioned between Israel and the surrounding Arab states."
"The fact that the guerrillas were primarily Malayan-Chinese Communists meant that the British attempt to quell the uprising was supported by the Muslim Malay majority, on the understanding that once the insurgency had been quelled, independence would be granted."
"The Malayan Emergency, as it was called, began in 1948 and lasted until 1960, but by 1957, Britain felt confident enough to grant independence to the Federation of Malaya within the Commonwealth."
"In 1963, the 11 states of the federation together with Singapore, Sarawak and North Borneo joined to form Malaysia, but in 1965 Chinese-majority Singapore was expelled from the union following tensions between the Malay and Chinese populations and became an independent city-state."
"Brunei, which had been a British protectorate since 1888, declined to join the union."
"Churchill and the Conservatives believed that Britain's position as a world power relied on the continued existence of the empire, with the base at the Suez Canal allowing Britain to maintain its pre-eminent position in the Middle East in spite of the loss of India."
"Churchill could not ignore Gamal Abdul Nasser's new revolutionary government of Egypt that had taken power in 1952, and the following year it was agreed that British troops would withdraw from the Suez Canal zone and that Sudan would be granted self-determination by 1955, with independence to follow."
"The response of Anthony Eden, who had succeeded Churchill as Prime Minister, was to collude with France to engineer an Israeli attack on Egypt that would give Britain and France an excuse to intervene militarily and retake the canal."
Another of Eisenhower's concerns was the possibility of a wider war with the Soviet Union after it threatened to intervene on the Egyptian side.
Eisenhower applied financial leverage by threatening to sell US reserves of the British pound and thereby precipitate a collapse of the British currency.
"The events at Suez wounded British national pride, leading one MP to describe it as ""Britain's Waterloo"" and another to suggest that the country had become an ""American satellite""."
"Britain again deployed its armed forces to the region, intervening in Oman (1957), Jordan (1958) and Kuwait (1961), though on these occasions with American approval, as the new Prime Minister Harold Macmillan's foreign policy was to remain firmly aligned with the United States."
"Although Britain granted Kuwait independence in 1961, it continued to maintain a military presence in the Middle East for another decade."
"The British granted independence to the Maldives in 1965 but continued to station a garrison there until 1976, withdrew from Aden in 1967, and granted independence to Bahrain, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates in 1971."
"Macmillan wished to avoid the same kind of colonial war that France was fighting in Algeria, and under his premiership decolonisation proceeded rapidly."
British withdrawal from the southern and eastern parts of Africa was not a peaceful process.
"Kenyan independence was preceded by the eight-year Mau Mau uprising, in which tens of thousands of suspected rebels were interned by the colonial government in detention camps."
The UK retained the military bases of Akrotiri and Dhekelia as sovereign base areas.
"Jamaica attained independence in 1962, as did Trinidad and Tobago."
"Barbados achieved independence in 1966 and the remainder of the eastern Caribbean islands, including the Bahamas, in the 1970s and 1980s, but Anguilla and the Turks and Caicos Islands opted to revert to British rule after they had already started on the path to independence."
"The British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands and Montserrat also opted to retain ties with Britain, while Guyana achieved independence in 1966."
"Britain's last colony on the American mainland, British Honduras, became a self-governing colony in 1964 and was renamed Belize in 1973, achieving full independence in 1981."
"Vanuatu's independence was delayed because of political conflict between English and French-speaking communities, as the islands had been jointly administered as a condominium with France."
"Fiji, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Tuvalu became Commonwealth realms."
"The passage of the British Nationality Act 1981, which reclassified the remaining Crown colonies as ""British Dependent Territories"" (renamed British Overseas Territories in 2002) meant that, aside from a scattering of islands and outposts, the process of decolonisation that had begun after the Second World War was largely complete."
"In 1982, Britain's resolve in defending its remaining overseas territories was tested when Argentina invaded the Falkland Islands, acting on a long-standing claim that dated back to the Spanish Empire."
"Although granted legislative independence by the Statute of Westminster 1931, vestigial constitutional links had remained in place."
"The British Parliament retained the power to amend key Canadian constitutional statutes, meaning that effectively an act of the British Parliament was required to make certain changes to the Canadian Constitution."
The British Parliament also had the power to pass laws extending to Canada at Canadian request.
"Although no longer able to pass any laws that would apply as Australian Commonwealth law, the British Parliament retained the power to legislate for the individual Australian States."
"With regard to New Zealand, the British Parliament retained the power to pass legislation applying to New Zealand with the New Zealand Parliament's consent."
"In 1982, the last legal link between Canada and Britain was severed by the Canada Act 1982, which was passed by the British parliament, formally patriating the Canadian Constitution."
The act ended the need for British involvement in changes to the Canadian constitution.
"Under the terms of the 1842 Treaty of Nanking and 1860 Convention of Peking, Hong Kong Island and Kowloon Peninsula had been respectively ceded to Britain in perpetuity, but the vast majority of the colony was constituted by the New Territories, which had been acquired under a 99-year lease in 1898, due to expire in 1997."
"Thatcher, seeing parallels with the Falkland Islands, initially wished to hold Hong Kong and proposed British administration with Chinese sovereignty, though this was rejected by China."
"A deal was reached in 1984—under the terms of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, Hong Kong would become a special administrative region of the People's Republic of China, maintaining its way of life for at least 50 years."

"Among the last states in the 20th century known as empires in this sense were the Central African Empire, Ethiopia, Empire of Vietnam, Manchukuo, Russia, Germany, and Korea."
"Ideas about empires have changed over time, ranging from public approval to universal distaste."
"Empires are built out of separate units with some kind of diversity – ethnic, national, cultural, religious – and imply at least some inequality between the rulers and the ruled."

"Some monarchies styled themselves as having greater size, scope, and power than the territorial, politico-military, and economic facts support."
"As a consequence, some monarchs assumed the title of ""emperor"" (or its corresponding translation, tsar, empereur, kaiser, shah  etc.)"
"Empires were seen as an expanding power, administration, ideas and beliefs followed by cultural habits from place to place."
Empires tend to impose their culture on the subject states to strengthen the imperial structure.

"Among these were the ""Byzantine Empire"", which was the actual continuation of the Eastern portion of the Roman Empire, the Carolingian Empire, the largely Germanic Holy Roman Empire, and the Russian Empire."
"Yet, these states did not always fit the geographic, political, or military profiles of empires in the modern sense of the word."
"To legitimise their imperium, these states directly claimed the title of Empire from Rome."
"The sacrum Romanum imperium (Holy Roman Empire), which lasted from 800 to 1806, claimed to have exclusively comprehended Christian principalities, and was only nominally a discrete imperial state."
"The Holy Roman Empire was not always centrally-governed, as it had neither core nor peripheral territories, and was not governed by a central, politico-military elite."
"Voltaire's ""nor an empire"" observation applies to its late period."
"In 1204, after the Fourth Crusade conquered Constantinople, the crusaders established a Latin Empire (1204–1261) in that city, while the defeated Byzantine Empire's descendants established two smaller, short-lived empires in Asia Minor: the Empire of Nicaea (1204–1261) and the Empire of Trebizond (1204–1461)."
"The Ottoman Empire was a successor of the Abbasid Empire and it was the most powerful empire to succeed the Abbasi empires at the time, as well as one of the most powerful empires in the world."
"The Ottoman Empire centered on modern day Turkey, dominated the eastern Mediterranean, overthrew the Byzantine Empire to claim Constantinople and it would start battering at Austria and Malta, which were countries that were key to central and to south-west Europe respectively — mainly for their geographical location."
"The reason these occurrences of batterings were so important was because the Ottomans were Muslim, and the rest of Europe was Christian, so there was a sense of religious fighting going on."
This was not just a rivalry of East and West but a rivalry between Christians and Muslims.
"Both the Christians and Muslims had alliances with other countries, and they had problems in them as well."

"Throughout the 19th century, the United States government attempted to expand its territory by any means necessary."
"Regardless of the supposed motivation for this constant expansion, all of these land acquisitions were carried out by imperialistic means."
"This was done by financial means in some cases, and by military force in others."
"This idea is explored in the ""contemporary usage"" section."
"The Roman Empire, perennially reborn, also lived on as the Byzantine Empire (Eastern Roman Empire) – temporarily splitting into the Latin Empire, the Empire of Nicaea and the Empire of Trebizond before its remaining territory and centre became part of the Ottoman Empire."
"A similarly persistent concept of empire saw the Mongol Empire become the Khanate of the Golden Horde, the Yuan Empire of China, and the Ilkhanate before resurrection as the Timurid Empire and as the Mughal Empire."

"Piganiol argues that the Roman Empire under its authority can be described as ""a period of terror"", holding its imperial system accountable for its failure."
"Another theory blames the rise of Christianity as the cause, arguing that the spread of certain Christian ideals caused internal weakness of the military and state."
"In the book The Fall of the Roman Empire, by Peter Heather, he contends that there are many factors, including issues of money and manpower, which produce military limitations and culminate in the Roman army's inability to effectively repel invading barbarians at the frontier."
"due to continual conflict and loss of territory which, in turn, generated loss of revenue from the tax base."
"There was also the looming presence of the Persians which, at any time, took a large percentage of the fighting force's attention."
"At the same time the Huns, a nomadic warrior people from the steppes of Asia, are also putting extreme pressure on the German tribes outside of the Roman frontier, which gave the German tribes no other choice, geographically, but to move into Roman territory."
"For example, Japan is considered the world's sole remaining empire because of the continued presence of the Japanese Emperor in national politics."
This characterisation is controversial because of the strong tendency in American society to reject claims of American imperialism.
"The initial motivations for the inception of the United States eventually led to the development of this tendency, which has been perpetuated by the country-wide obsession with this national narrative."
The United States was formed because colonists did not like being under control of the British Empire.
"Essentially, the United States was formed in an attempt to reject imperialism."
This makes it very hard for people to acknowledge America's status as an empire.
"This active rejection of imperialist status is not limited to high-ranking government officials, as it has been ingrained in American society throughout its entire history."
This often results in imperialist endeavors being presented as measures taken to enhance state security.
"Ludden explains this phenomenon with the concept of ""ideological blinders"", which he says prevent American citizens from realizing the true nature of America's current systems and strategies."
American exceptionalism) impairs popular recognition of US imperial conduct since it governed other countries via surrogates.
"These surrogates were domestically-weak, right-wing governments that would collapse without US support."
"This statement directly contradicts Thomas Jefferson who, in the 1780s while awaiting the fall of the Spanish empire, said: ""till our population can be sufficiently advanced to gain it from them piece by piece""."
The big size and high development index of the EU economy often has the ability to influence global trade regulations in its favour.

"He attributed this decadence to an excessively long period of wealth and power, selfishness, love of money, and the loss of a sense of duty."
"Mike Maloney, an economist, arrived at exactly the same conclusion but in Economic terms  whilst studying the history of money."
It is the nation-state—an essentially 19th-century ideal—that is the historical novelty and that may yet prove to be the more ephemeral entity.
"In fact, it is a very distorted view of even the Westphalian era not to recognize that it was always at least as much about empires as it was states."
Empire has been the historically predominant form of order in world politics.
"Looking at a time frame of several millennia, there was no global anarchic system until the European explorations and subsequent imperial and colonial ventures connected disparate regional systems, doing so approximately 500 years ago."
"Prior to this emergence of a global-scope system, the pattern of world politics was characterized by regional systems."
These regional systems were initially anarchic and marked by high levels of military competition.
"Within this global pattern of regional empires, European political order was distinctly anomalous because it persisted so long as an anarchy."
"Many empires endured for centuries, while the age of the ancient Egyptian, Chinese and Japanese Empires is counted in millennia."
"""Most people throughout history have lived under imperial rule."""
The recurrent pattern in every civilization of which we have knowledge was for one state to unify the system under its imperial domination.
The propensity toward universal empire was the principal feature of pre-modern politics.
They have held the leading role ever since.
German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck finds that the macro-historic process of imperial expansion gave rise to global history in which the formations of universal empires were most significant stages.
"A later group of political scientists, working on the phenomenon of the current unipolarity, in 2007 edited research on several pre-modern civilizations by experts in respective fields."
The overall conclusion was that the balance of power was inherently unstable order and usually soon broke in favor of imperial order.
"If this conclusion is warranted, it illuminates our understanding of civilization itself."
"Most states systems have ended in universal empire, which has swallowed all the states of the system."
The examples are so abundant that we must ask two questions: Is there any states system which has not led fairly directly to the establishment of a world empire?
Does the evidence rather suggest that we should expect any states system to culminate in this way?
"It might be argued that every state system can only maintain its existence on the balance of power, that the latter is inherently unstable, and that sooner or later its tensions and conflicts will be resolved into a monopoly of power."
"Although no individual Epoch may have contemplated this purpose, yet is this the spirit which runs through all these individual Epochs, and invisibly urges them onward."
"Fichte's later compatriot, Geographer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), in the mid-Nineteenth century observed a macro-historic trend of imperial growth in both Hemispheres: ""Men of great and strong minds, as well as whole nations, acted under influence of one idea, the purity of which was utterly unknown to them."""
The imperial expansion filled the world circa 1900.
"His seventh law stated: ""The general trend toward amalgamation transmits the tendency of territorial growth from state to state and increases the tendency in the process of transmission."""
"He commented on this law to make its meaning clear: ""There is on this small planet sufficient space for only one great state."
"""Two other contemporaries—Kang Yu-wei and George Vacher de Lapouge—stressed that imperial expansion cannot indefinitely proceed on the definite surface of the globe and therefore world empire is imminent."
"This undoubtedly is the logical final stage in the geopolitical theory of evolution."""
The trend toward world domination or hegemony of a single power is but the ultimate consummation of a power-system engrafted upon an otherwise integrated world.
"The year after the War and in the first year of the nuclear age, Albert Einstein and British Philosopher Bertrand Russell, known as prominent pacifists, outlined for the near future a perspective of world empire (world government established by force)."
"Einstein believed that, unless world government is established by agreement, an imperial world government would come by war or wars."
Russell expected a third World War to result in a world government under the empire of the United States.
"Three years later, another prominent pacifist, Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr, generalized on the ancient Empires of Egypt, Babylon, Persia and Greece to imply for the modern world: ""The analogy in present global terms would be the final unification of the world through the preponderant power of either America or Russia, whichever proved herself victorious in the final struggle."
"""Russian colleague of Russell and Neighbour, Georgy Fedotov, wrote in 1945: All empires are but stages on the way to the sole Empire which must swallow all others."
The only question is who will build it and on which foundations.
Universal unity is the only alternative to annihilation.
Unity by conference is utopian but unity by conquest by the strongest Power is not and probably the uncompleted in this War will be completed in the next.
The historical stage for a world empire had already been set prior to and independently of the discovery of atomic weapons but these weapons make a world empire inevitable and imminent.
Only a world empire can establish monopoly on atomic weapons and thus guarantee the survival of civilization.
"A world empire ""is in fact the objective of the Third World War which, in its preliminary stages, has already began""."
"The issue of a world empire ""will be decided, and in our day."
"In the course of the decision, both of the present antagonists may, it is true, be destroyed, but one of them must be."""
"The year this volume of A Study of History was published, US Secretary of State John Foster Dulles announced ""a knock-out blow"" as an official doctrine, a detailed Plan was elaborated and Fortune magazine mapped the design."
"Section VIII, ""Atomic Armaments"", of the famous National Security Council Report 68 (NSC 68), approved by President Harry Truman in 1951, uses the term ""blow"" 17 times, mostly preceded by such adjectives as ""powerful"", ""overwhelming"", or ""crippling""."
"The warring states of the Twentieth century seem headed for a similar resolution of their conflicts."""
"The ancient ""resolution"" McNeill evoked was one of the most sweeping universal conquests in world history, performed by Qin in 230–221 BC."
Herman Kahn of the RAND Corporation criticized to an assembled group of SAC officers their war plan (SIOP-62).
"He did not use the term bacchanal but he coined on the occasion an associating word: ""Gentlemen, you do not have a war plan."
History did not completely repeat itself but it passed close.
"The Empires of Egypt, China and Japan are named the most durable political structures in human history."
"Correspondingly, these are the three most circumscribed civilizations in human history."
"German Sociologist Friedrich Tenbruck, criticizing the Western idea of progress, emphasized that China and Egypt remained at one particular stage of development for millennia."
This stage was universal empire.
"The development of Egypt and China came to a halt once their empires ""reached the limits of their natural habitat""."
"Sinology does not recognize the Eurocentric view of the ""inevitable"" imperial fall; Egyptology and Japanology pose equal challenges."
Carneiro explored the Bronze Age civilizations.
"They conclude: The ""rigidity of the borders"" contributed importantly to hegemony in every concerned case."
"The circumscribed Chinese Empire recovered from all falls, while the fall of Rome, by contrast, was fatal."
"If ""Europe had been a closed system, some great power would eventually have succeeded in establishing absolute supremacy over the other states in the region""."
"His 1945 book on the four centuries of the European power struggle, Ludwig Dehio titled The Precarious Balance."
"He explained the durability of the European states system by its overseas expansion: ""Overseas expansion and the system of states were born at the same time; the vitality that burst the bounds of the Western world also destroyed its unity."""
Edward Carr causally linked the end of the overseas outlet for imperial expansion and World Wars.
"In the nineteenth century, he wrote during the Second World War, imperialist wars were waged against ""primitive"" peoples."
"Since 1900, however, this has no longer been possible: ""the situation has radically changed""."
"Now wars are between ""imperial powers."""
"Hans Morgenthau wrote that the very imperial expansion into relatively empty geographical spaces in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth centuries, in Africa, Eurasia, and western North America, deflected great power politics into the periphery of the earth, thereby reducing conflict."
"For example, the more attention Russia, France and the United States paid to expanding into far-flung territories in imperial fashion, the less attention they paid to one another, and the more peaceful, in a sense, the world was."
"But by the late nineteenth century, the consolidation of the great nation-states and empires of the West was consummated, and territorial gains could only be made at the expense of one another."
Thus the openness of the world contributed to the consolidation of the territorial system.
The end of the 'world frontier' and the resulting closedness of an interdependent world inevitably affected the system's effectiveness.
"The opportunity for any system to expand in size seems almost a necessary condition for it to remain balanced, at least over the long haul."
"Far from being impossible or exceedingly improbable, systemic hegemony is likely under two conditions: ""when the boundaries of the international system remain stable and no new major powers emerge from outside the system."""
"With the system becoming global, further expansion is precluded."
"The geopolitical condition of ""global closure"" will remain to the end of history."
"Since ""the contemporary international system is global, we can rule out the possibility that geographic expansion of the system will contribute to the emergence of a new balance of power, as it did so many times in the past."""
"As Quincy Wright had put it, ""this process can no longer continue without interplanetary wars."
"""One of leading experts on world-system theory, Christopher Chase-Dunn, noted that the circumscription theory is applicable for the global system, since the global system is circumscribed."
"In fact, within less than a century of its circumscribed existence the global system overcame the centuries-old balance of power and reached the unipolarity."
"Once the state of entropy is reached, there is no going back."
The initial conditions are lost forever.
"Stressing the curiosity of the fact, Schweller writes that since the moment the modern world became a closed system, the process has worked in only one direction: from many poles to two poles to one pole."
Thus unipolarity might represent the entropy—stable and permanent loss of variation—in the global system.
"After the war is over, it is tempting for the victor to retain such bases and easy to find reasons to do so."
"Commonly, preparedness for a possible resumption of hostilities will be invoked."
"Over time, if a nation’s aims become imperial, the bases form the skeleton of an empire."
"A Defense Department map of the world, which shows the areas of responsibility of the five major regional commands, suggests that America's sphere of military influence is now literally global … The regional combatant commanders—the 'pro-consuls' of this imperium—have responsibility for swaths of territory beyond the wildest imaginings of their Roman predecessors."
"Another Harvard Historian Charles S. Maier opens his Among Empires: American Ascendancy and Its Predecessors with these words: ""What a substratum for empire!"
"Compared with which, the foundation of the Macedonian, the Roman and the British, sink into insignificance."
"""One of the most accepted distinctions between earlier empires and the American Empire is the latter's “global” or “planetary” scope."
"The quests for universal empire are old but the present quest outdoes the previous in ""the notable respect of being the first to actually be global in its reach."""
The Pax Britannica was run on the cheap.
Charlemagne’s empire was merely western European in stretch.
"The Roman Empire stretched further afield, but there was another great empire in Persia and a larger one in China."
"Walter Russell Mead observes that the United States attempts to repeate “globally” what the ancient empires of Egypt, China and Rome had each accomplished on a regional basis."
Niall Ferguson lists numerous parallels between them and the United States.
All dominant empires thought they were special.
The Occident was an open area.
"But the globe was not, and, for that very reason, ultimately destined to be unified… And this very process [of unification] was clearly reflected in both World Wars."
"Fifteen years later, Dehio confirmed his hypothesis: The European system owed its durability to its overseas outlet."
"“But how can a multiple grouping of world states conceivably be supported from outside in the framework of a finite globe?”During the same time, Quincy Wright developed a similar concept."
Balance-of-power politics has aimed less at preserving peace than at preserving the independence of states and preventing the development of world empire.
"In the course of history, the balance of power repeatedly reemerged, but on ever-wider scale."
"Eventually, the scale became global."
"Unless we proceed to “interplanetary wars,” this pattern can no longer continue."
They worked with historical atlases but the advent of YouTube provided us with a better visualization.
They reached the same conclusion—that a world empire is pre-determined—and attempted to estimate the time of its appearance.
Naroll and Carneiro found that this time is close at hand: around the year 2200 and 2300 respectively.
They will try to find an escape.
"But they will try in vain… At the end of the war the crushing superiority of American plane production will be an established fact… The solution of the problem … is by no means ideal, nor even satisfactory."
"Coudenhove-Kalergi's follower in the teleological theory of World State, Toynbee, supposed the traditional way of universal conquest and emphasized that the world is ripe for conquest: ""…Hitler's eventual failure to impose peace on the world by the force of arms was due, not to any flaw in his thesis that the world was ripe for conquest, but to an accidental combination of incidental errors in his measures…"" But ""in falling by so narrow a margin to win the prize of world-dominion for himself, Hitler had left the prize dangling within the reach of any successor capable of pursuing the same aims of world-conquest with a little more patience, prudence, and tact."""
"John Ikenberry finds that the Europeans wanted a stronger, more formal and more imperial system than the United States was initially willing to provide."
"In 1951, before he became President, he had written on West Europe: “We cannot be a modern Rome guarding the far frontiers with our legions if for no other reason than that these are not, politically, our frontiers."
"Notably, when the US troops eventually left, they left eastward."
"Dimitri Simes finds that most of the world sees the United States as a ""nascent"" imperial power."
Some scholars concerned how this empire would look in its ultimate form.
The ultimate form of empire was described by Michael Doyle in his Empires.
It is empire in which its two main components—the ruling core and the ruled periphery—merged to form one integrated whole.
At this stage the empire as defined ceases to exist and becomes world state.
"Replying on criticism, Wendt invoked the example of the Roman Empire: A ""world empire would be an unstable equilibrium, still subject to the struggle for recognition."""
Strange emphasized that the most persistent empires were those which best managed to integrate the ruling core and the peripheral allies.
"The article is partly a reply on the  published a year earlier bestseller The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers which predicted imminent US ""imperial overstretch."""
"There will then be a true world state, and it will be possible to forget that it will have owed its origin to conquest."
"When such a reformation occurs in our world, he writes, the green card would be abolished since all earth inhabitants would have it by birth."
"This cosmopolitan World State, as the records of earlier circumscribed civilizations suggest, will last millennia."
"The history of Iran, which was commonly known until the mid-20th century as Persia in the Western world, is intertwined with the history of a larger region, also to an extent known as Greater Iran, comprising the area from Anatolia, the Bosphorus, and Egypt in the west to the borders of Ancient India and the Syr Darya in the east, and from the Caucasus and the Eurasian Steppe in the north to the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman in the south."
"Iran is home to one of the world's oldest continuous major civilizations, with historical and urban settlements dating back to 7000 BC."
"The south-western and western part of the Iranian Plateau participated in the traditional Ancient Near East with Elam, from the Early Bronze Age, and later with various other peoples, such as the Kassites, Mannaeans, and Gutians."
"Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel calls the Persians the ""first Historical People""."
It was the largest empire yet seen and the first world empire.
"They were succeeded by the Seleucid, Parthian, and Sasanian Empires, who successively governed Iran for almost 1,000 years and made Iran once again as a leading power in the world."
"Persia's arch-rival was the Roman Empire and its successor, the Byzantine Empire."
"The Iranian Empire proper begins in the Iron Age, following the influx of Iranian peoples."
"Iranian people gave rise to the Medes, the Achaemenid, Parthian, and Sasanian Empires of classical antiquity."
"Once a major empire, Iran has endured invasions too, by Greeks, Arabs and Mongols."
Iran has continually reasserted its national identity throughout the centuries and has developed as a distinct political and cultural entity.
"Islamization of Iran took place during the eighth to tenth centuries, leading to the eventual decline of Zoroastrianism in Iran as well as many of its dependencies."
"However, the achievements of the previous Persian civilizations were not lost, but were to a great extent absorbed by the new Islamic polity and civilization."
"Iran, with its long history of early cultures and empires, had suffered particularly hard during the late Middle Ages and the early modern period."
Mousterian stone tools made by Neandertals have also been found.
"There are more cultural remains of Neandertals dating back to the Middle Paleolithic period, which mainly have been found in the Zagros region and fewer in central Iran at sites such as Kobeh, Kunji, Bisitun Cave, Tamtama, Warwasi, and Yafteh Cave."
"Evidence for Upper Paleolithic and Epipaleolithic periods are known mainly from the Zagros Mountains in the caves of Kermanshah, Piranshahr and Khorramabad and a few number of sites in the Alborz and Central Iran."
"During this time, people began creating rock art."
"Around about the same time, the earliest-known clay vessels and modelled human and animal terracotta figurines were produced at Ganj Dareh, also in western Iran."
The two main Neolithic Iranian settlements were the Zayandeh River Culture and Ganj Dareh.
"Based on C14 dating, the time of the foundation of the city is as early as 4395 BC, a time right after the establishment of the ancient Sumerian city of Uruk in 4500 BC."
"The general perception among archaeologists is that Susa was an extension of the Sumerian city-state of Uruk, hence incorporating many aspects of Mesopotamian culture."
"In its later history, Susa became the capital of Elam, which emerged as a state founded 4000 BC."
"There are also dozens of prehistoric sites across the Iranian plateau pointing to the existence of ancient cultures and urban settlements in the fourth millennium BC, One of the earliest civilizations in Iranian plateau was the Jiroft culture in southeastern Iran in the province of Kerman."
It is one of the most artefact-rich archaeological sites in the Middle East.
Archaeological excavations in Jiroft led to the discovery of several objects belonging to the 4th millennium BC.
"There is a large quantity of objects decorated with highly distinctive engravings of animals, mythological figures, and architectural motifs."
The objects and their iconography are unlike anything ever seen before by archaeologists.
"Many are made from chlorite, a grey-green soft stone; others are in copper, bronze, terracotta, and even lapis lazuli."
The Early Bronze Age saw the rise of urbanization into organized city-states and the invention of writing (the Uruk period) in the Near East.
"While Bronze Age Elam made use of writing from an early time, the Proto-Elamite script remains undeciphered, and records from Sumer pertaining to Elam are scarce."
"As early as the 20th century BC, tribes came to the Iranian Plateau from the Pontic–Caspian steppe."
"The arrival of Iranians on the Iranian plateau forced the Elamites to relinquish one area of their empire after another and to take refuge in Elam, Khuzestan and the nearby area, which only then became coterminous with Elam."
Bahman Firuzmandi say that the southern Iranians might be intermixed with the Elamite peoples living in the plateau.
"By the mid-first millennium BC, Medes, Persians, and Parthians populated the Iranian plateau."
"Until the rise of the Medes, they all remained under Assyrian domination, like the rest of the Near East."
"In the first half of the first millennium BC, parts of what is now Iranian Azerbaijan were incorporated into Urartu."
For over 150 years Assyrian kings of nearby Northern Mesopotamia had been wanting to conquer Median tribes of Western Iran.
"In 612 BC, Cyaxares, Deioces' grandson, and the Babylonian king Nabopolassar invaded Assyria and laid siege to and eventually destroyed Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, which led to the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire."
Urartu was later on conquered and dissolved as well by the Medes.
"Cyrus the Great overthrew, in turn, the Median, Lydian, and Neo-Babylonian Empires, creating an empire far larger than Assyria."
"He was better able, through more benign policies, to reconcile his subjects to Persian rule; the longevity of his empire was one result."
"Cyrus's son, Cambyses II, conquered the last major power of the region, ancient Egypt, causing the collapse of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt."
"Since he became ill and died before, or while, leaving Egypt, stories developed, as related by Herodotus, that he was struck down for impiety against the ancient Egyptian deities."
"The winner, Darius I, based his claim on membership in a collateral line of the Achaemenid Empire."
"Darius' first capital was at Susa, and he started the building program at Persepolis."
"He rebuilt a canal between the Nile and the Red Sea, a forerunner of the modern Suez Canal."
"He improved the extensive road system, and it is during his reign that mentions is first made of the Royal Road (shown on map), a great highway stretching all the way from Susa to Sardis with posting stations at regular intervals."
Major reforms took place under Darius.
"The Old Persian language appears in royal inscriptions, written in a specially adapted version of the cuneiform script."
"Under Cyrus the Great and Darius I, the Persian Empire eventually became the largest empire in human history up until that point, ruling and administrating over most of the then known world, as well as spanning the continents of Europe, Asia, and Africa."
The greatest achievement was the empire itself.
The Persian Empire represented the world's first superpower that was based on a model of tolerance and respect for other cultures and religions.
"In the late sixth century BC, Darius launched his European campaign, in which he defeated the Paeonians, conquered Thrace, and subdued all coastal Greek cities, as well as defeating the European Scythians around the Danube river."
"This led to an Achaemenid campaign against mainland Greece known as the Greco-Persian Wars, which lasted the first half of the 5th century BC, and is known as one of the most important wars in European history."
"In the First Persian invasion of Greece, the Persian general Mardonius re-subjugated Thrace and made Macedon a full part of Persia."
"The war eventually turned out in defeat, however."
Darius' successor Xerxes I launched the Second Persian invasion of Greece.
"At a crucial moment in the war, about half of mainland Greece was overrun by the Persians, including all territories to the north of the Isthmus of Corinth, however, this was also turned out in a Greek victory, following the battles of Plataea and Salamis, by which Persia lost its footholds in Europe, and eventually withdrew from it."
During the Greco-Persian wars Persia gained major territorial advantages capture and razed Athens in 480 BC.
"However, after a string of Greek victories the Persians were forced to withdraw thus losing control of Macedonia, Thrace and Ionia."
"Fighting continued for several decades after the successful Greek repelling of the Second Invasion with numerous Greek city-states under the Athens' newly formed Delian League, which eventually ended with the peace of Callias in 449 BC, ending the Greco-Persian Wars."
"Later pharaohs successfully resisted Persian attempts to reconquer Egypt until 343 BC, when Egypt was reconquered by Artaxerxes III."
"Alexander's empire broke up shortly after his death, and Alexander's general, Seleucus I Nicator, tried to take control of Iran, Mesopotamia, and later Syria and Anatolia."
His empire was the Seleucid Empire.
"Greek language, philosophy, and art came with the colonists."
"During the Seleucid era, Greek became the common tongue of diplomacy and literature throughout the empire."
The Parthian Empire quickly included Eastern Arabia.
Parthia was the eastern arch-enemy of the Roman Empire and it limited Rome's expansion beyond Cappadocia (central Anatolia).
The Parthian armies included two types of cavalry: the heavily armed and armoured cataphracts and the lightly-armed but highly-mobile mounted archers.
"For the Romans, who relied on heavy infantry, the Parthians were too hard to defeat, as both types of cavalry were much faster and more mobile than foot soldiers."
"The Parthian shot used by the Parthian cavalry was most notably feared by the Roman soldiers, which proved pivotal in the crushing Roman defeat at the Battle of Carrhae."
"On the other hand, the Parthians found it difficult to occupy conquered areas as they were unskilled in siege warfare."
"Because of these weaknesses, neither the Romans nor the Parthians were able completely to annex each other's territory."
"The Parthian empire subsisted for five centuries, longer than most Eastern Empires."
"The end of this empire came at last in 224 AD, when the empire's organization had loosened and the last king was defeated by one of the empire's vassal peoples, the Persians under the Sasanians."
"However, the Arsacid dynasty continued to exist for centuries onwards in Armenia, the Iberia, and the Caucasian Albania, which were all eponymous branches of the dynasty."
"For a period of more than 400 years, Iran was once again one of the leading powers in the world, alongside its neighbouring rival, the Roman and then Byzantine Empires."
"The empire's territory, at its height, encompassed all of today's Iran, Iraq, Azerbaijan, Armenia, Georgia, Abkhazia, Dagestan, Lebanon, Jordan, Palestine, Israel, parts of Afghanistan, Turkey, Syria, parts of Pakistan, Central Asia, Eastern Arabia, and parts of Egypt."
"Most of the Sassanian Empire's lifespan it was overshadowed by the frequent Byzantine–Sasanian wars, a continuation of the Roman–Parthian Wars and the all-comprising Roman–Persian Wars; the last was the longest-lasting conflict in human history."
"Started in the first century BC by their predecessors, the Parthians, and Romans, the last Roman–Persian War was fought in the seventh century."
The Persians defeated the Romans at the Battle of Edessa in 260 and took emperor Valerian prisoner for the remainder of his life.
Eastern Arabia was conquered early on.
"During this time, the Sassanian and Romano-Byzantine armies clashed for influence in Anatolia, the western Caucasus (mainly Lazica and the Kingdom of Iberia; modern-day Georgia and Abkhazia), Mesopotamia, Armenia and the Levant."
"Under Justinian I, the war came to an uneasy peace with payment of tribute to the Sassanians."
"However, the Sasanians used the deposition of the Byzantine emperor Maurice as a casus belli to attack the Empire."
"After many gains, the Sassanians were defeated at Issus, Constantinople, and finally Nineveh, resulting in peace."
"With the conclusion of the over 700 years lasting Roman–Persian Wars through the climactic Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, which included the very siege of the Byzantine capital of Constantinople, the war-exhausted Persians lost the Battle of al-Qādisiyyah (632) in Hilla (present-day Iraq) to the invading Muslim forces."
"The Sasanian era, encompassing the length of Late Antiquity, is considered to be one of the most important and influential historical periods in Iran, and had a major impact on the world."
"In many ways, the Sassanian period witnessed the highest achievement of Persian civilization and constitutes the last great Iranian Empire before the adoption of Islam."
The dynasty's unique and aristocratic culture transformed the Islamic conquest and destruction of Iran into a Persian Renaissance.
"Much of what later became known as Islamic culture, architecture, writing, and other contributions to civilization, were taken from the Sassanian Persians into the broader Muslim world."
"Several Iranian nobles and families such as king Dinar of the House of Karen, and later Kanarangiyans of Khorasan, mutinied against their Sasanian overlords."
"Although the House of Mihran had claimed the Sasanian throne under the two prominent generals Bahrām Chōbin and Shahrbaraz, it remained loyal to the Sasanians during their struggle against the Arabs, but the Mihrans were eventually betrayed and defeated by their own kinsmen, the House of Ispahbudhan, under their leader Farrukhzad, who had mutinied against Yazdegerd III."
"Yazdegerd III, fled from one district to another until a local miller killed him for his purse at Merv in 651."
"By 674, Muslims had conquered Greater Khorasan (which included modern Iranian Khorasan province and modern Afghanistan and parts of Transoxiana)."
The Muslim conquest of Persia ended the Sasanian Empire and led to the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia.
"Over time, the majority of Iranians converted to Islam."
"Most of the aspects of the previous Persian civilizations were not discarded, but were absorbed by the new Islamic polity."
"Both perceptions are of course valid, depending on one's angle of vision."
"Arab provincial governors were undoubtedly either Persianized Arameans or ethnic Persians; certainly Persian remained the language of official business of the caliphate until the adoption of Arabic toward the end of the seventh century, when in 692 minting began at the capital, Damascus."
"The new Islamic coins evolved from imitations of Sasanian coins (as well as Byzantine), and the Pahlavi script on the coinage was replaced with Arabic alphabet."
"During the Umayyad Caliphate, the Arab conquerors imposed Arabic as the primary language of the subject peoples throughout their empire."
"Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf, who was not happy with the prevalence of the Persian language in the divan, ordered the official language of the conquered lands to be replaced by Arabic, sometimes by force."
"There are a number of historians who see the rule of the Umayyads as setting up the ""dhimmah""  to increase taxes from the dhimmis to benefit the Muslim Arab community financially and by discouraging conversion."
"Governors lodged complaints with the caliph when he enacted laws that made conversion easier, depriving the provinces of revenues."
"In the 7th century, when many non-Arabs such as Persians entered Islam, they were recognized as mawali (""clients"") and treated as second-class citizens by the ruling Arab elite until the end of the Umayyad Caliphate."
"During this era, Islam was initially associated with the ethnic identity of the Arab and required formal association with an Arab tribe and the adoption of the client status of mawali."
The half-hearted policies of the late Umayyads to tolerate non-Arab Muslims and Shias had failed to quell unrest among these minorities.
"However, all of Iran was still not under Arab control, and the region of Daylam was under the control of the Daylamites, while Tabaristan was under Dabuyid and Paduspanid control, and the Mount Damavand region under Masmughans of Damavand."
"The Arabs had invaded these regions several times, but achieved no decisive result because of the inaccessible terrain of the regions."
Abu Muslim was sent to Khorasan by the Abbasid Caliphate initially as a propagandist and then to revolt on their behalf.
He took Merv defeating the Umayyad governor there Nasr ibn Sayyar.
He became the de facto Abbasid governor of Khurasan.
"During the same period, the Dabuyid ruler Khurshid declared independence from the Umayyads, but was shortly forced to recognize Abbasid authority."
"In 750, Abu Muslim became the leader of the Abbasid army and defeated the Umayyads at the Battle of the Zab."
"Abu Muslim stormed Damascus, the capital of the Umayyad caliphate, later that year."
"It contained both Iranian and Arab elements, and the Abbasids enjoyed both Iranian and Arab support."
The Abbasids overthrew the Umayyads in 750.
"The latter region was influenced by Persian history and culture, and moving the capital was part of the Persian mawali demand for Arab influence in the empire."
"Eventually, this change meant that many caliphs under the Abbasids ended up in a much more ceremonial role than ever before, with the vizier in real power."
"The Abbasid caliphs began enlisting mamluks, Turkic-speaking warriors, who had been moving out of Central Asia into Transoxiana as slave warriors as early as the 9th century."
"Shortly thereafter the real power of the Abbasid caliphs began to wane; eventually, they became religious figureheads while the warrior slaves ruled."
"The 9th century also saw the revolt by native Zoroastrians, known as the Khurramites, against oppressive Arab rule."
The movement was led by Persian freedom fighter Babak Khorramdin.
"Babak's Iranianizing rebellion, from its base in Azerbaijan in northwestern Iran, called for a return of the political glories of the Iranian past."
"The Khorramdin rebellion of Babak spread to the Western and Central parts of Iran and lasted more than twenty years before it was defeated when Babak was betrayed by Afshin, a senior general of the Abbasid Caliphate."
"As the power of the Abbasid caliphs diminished, a series of dynasties rose in various parts of Iran, some with considerable influence and power."
"Among the most important of these overlapping dynasties were the Tahirids in Khorasan (821–873); the Saffarids in Sistan (861–1003, their rule lasted as maliks of Sistan until 1537); and the Samanids (819–1005), originally at Bukhara."
"Since much of the Abbasid administration had been Persian anyway, the Buyids were quietly able to assume real power in Baghdad."
"The Buyids were defeated in the mid-11th century by the Seljuq Turks, who continued to exert influence over the Abbasids, while publicly pledging allegiance to them."
The balance of power in Baghdad remained as such – with the Abbasids in power in name only – until the Mongol invasion of 1258 sacked the city and definitively ended the Abbasid dynasty.
"Richard Bulliet's ""conversion curve"" indicates that only about 10% of Iran converted to Islam during the relatively Arab-centric Umayyad period."
"Beginning in the Abbasid period, with its mix of Persian as well as Arab rulers, the Muslim percentage of the population rose."
"As Persian Muslims consolidated their rule of the country, the Muslim population rose from approximately 40% in the mid-9th century to close to 100% by the end of the 11th century."
"Most of those behind the movement were Persian, but references to Egyptians, Berbers and Aramaeans are attested."
"Citing as its basis Islamic notions of equality of races and nations, the movement was primarily concerned with preserving Persian culture and protecting Persian identity, though within a Muslim context."
"The Samanid dynasty led the revival of Persian culture and the first important Persian poet after the arrival of Islam, Rudaki, was born during this era and was praised by Samanid kings."
The Samanids also revived many ancient Persian festivals.
"Their successor, the Ghaznawids, who were of non-Iranian Turkic origin, also became instrumental in the revival of Persian culture."
"The culmination of the Persianization movement was the Shahnameh, the national epic of Iran, written almost entirely in Persian."
"This voluminous work,  reflects Iran's ancient history, its unique cultural values, its pre-Islamic Zoroastrian religion, and its sense of nationhood."
"And after an interval of silence, Iran re-emerged as a separate, different and distinctive element within Islam, eventually adding a new element even to Islam itself."
"Culturally, politically, and most remarkable of all even religiously, the Iranian contribution to this new Islamic civilization is of immense importance."
"The work of Iranians can be seen in every field of cultural endeavour, including Arabic poetry, to which poets of Iranian origin composing their poems in Arabic made a very significant contribution."
"In a sense, Iranian Islam is a second advent of Islam itself, a new Islam sometimes referred to as Islam-i Ajam."
"It was this Persian Islam, rather than the original Arab Islam, that was brought to new areas and new peoples: to the Turks, first in Central Asia and then in the Middle East in the country which came to be called Turkey, and of course to India."
"Inheriting a heritage of thousands of years of civilization, and being at the ""crossroads of the major cultural highways"", contributed to Persia emerging as what culminated into the ""Islamic Golden Age""."
"The invasion of India was undertaken in 1000 by the Ghaznavid ruler, Mahmud, and continued for several years."
"They were unable to hold power for long, however, particularly after the death of Mahmud in 1030."
The dynasty had its origins in the Turcoman tribal confederations of Central Asia and marked the beginning of Turkic power in the Middle East.
They established a Sunni Muslim rule over parts of Central Asia and the Middle East from the 11th to 14th centuries.
They set up an empire known as Great Seljuq Empire that stretched from Anatolia in the west to western Afghanistan in the east and the western borders of (modern-day) China in the north-east; and was the target of the First Crusade.
"Today they are regarded as the cultural ancestors of the Western Turks, the present-day inhabitants of Turkey and Turkmenistan, and they are remembered as great patrons of Persian culture, art, literature, and language."
"The founder of the dynasty, Tughril Beg, turned his army against the Ghaznavids in Khorasan."
"He moved south and then west, conquering but not wasting the cities in his path."
"In 1055 the caliph in Baghdad gave Tughril Beg robes, gifts, and the title King of the East."
"Under Tughril Beg's successor, Malik Shah (1072–1092), Iran enjoyed a cultural and scientific renaissance, largely attributed to his brilliant Iranian vizier, Nizam al Mulk."
"These leaders established the observatory where Omar Khayyám did much of his experimentation for a new calendar, and they built religious schools in all the major towns."
"In Anatolia, Malik Shah I was succeeded by Kilij Arslan I who founded the Sultanate of Rûm and in Syria by his brother Tutush I."
"In Persia he was succeeded by his son Mahmud I whose reign was contested by his other three brothers Barkiyaruq in Iraq, Muhammad I in Baghdad and Ahmad Sanjar in Khorasan."
"As Seljuq power in Iran weakened, other dynasties began to step up in its place, including a resurgent Abbasid caliphate and the Khwarezmshahs."
"The Khwarezmid Empire was a Sunni Muslim Persianate dynasty, of East Turkic origin, that ruled in Central Asia."
"Originally vassals of the Seljuqs, they took advantage of the decline of the Seljuqs to expand into Iran."
In 1194 the Khwarezmshah Ala ad-Din Tekish defeated the Seljuq sultan Toghrul III in battle and the Seljuq empire in Iran collapsed.
"Of the former Seljuq Empire, only the Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia remained."
"A serious internal threat to the Seljuqs during their reign came from the Nizari Ismailis, a secret sect with headquarters at Alamut Castle between Rasht and Tehran."
They controlled the immediate area for more than 150 years and sporadically sent out adherents to strengthen their rule by murdering important officials.
Several of the various theories on the etymology of the word assassin derive from these killers.
"Parts of northwestern Iran were conquered in the early 13th century AD by the Kingdom of Georgia, led by Tamar the Great."
"Genghis Khan had unified the Mongols, and under him the Mongol Empire quickly expanded in several directions."
"At that time, the Khwarazmian Empire was ruled by Ala ad-Din Muhammad (1200–1220)."
"Muhammad, like Genghis, was intent on expanding his lands and had gained the submission of most of Iran."
He declared himself shah and demanded formal recognition from the Abbasid caliph Al-Nasir.
"When the caliph rejected his claim, Ala ad-Din Muhammad proclaimed one of his nobles caliph and unsuccessfully tried to depose an-Nasir."
"The Mongol invasion of Iran began in 1219, after two diplomatic missions to Khwarezm sent by Genghis Khan had been massacred."
"During 1220–21 Bukhara, Samarkand, Herat, Tus and Nishapur were razed, and the whole populations were slaughtered."
"The Khwarezm-Shah fled, to die on an island off the Caspian coast."
"During the invasion of Transoxiana in 1219, along with the main Mongol force, Genghis Khan used a Chinese specialist catapult unit in battle, they were used again in 1220 in Transoxania."
"""Whole regiments"" entirely made out of Chinese were used by the Mongols to command bomb hurling trebuchets during the invasion of Iran."
Historians have suggested that the Mongol invasion had brought Chinese gunpowder weapons to Central Asia.
"One of these was the huochong, a Chinese mortar."
Books written around the area afterward depicted gunpowder weapons which resembled those of China.
The Mongol invasion was disastrous to the Iranians.
"Although the Mongol invaders were eventually converted to Islam and accepted the culture of Iran, the Mongol destruction of the Islamic heartland marked a major change of direction for the region."
"Destruction of qanat irrigation systems destroyed the pattern of relatively continuous settlement, producing numerous isolated oasis cities in a land where they had previously been rare."
"A large number of people, particularly males, were killed; between 1220 and 1258, 90% of the total population of Iran may have been killed as a result of mass extermination and famine."
"Genghis' grandson, Hulagu Khan, was tasked with the westward expansion of Mongol dominion."
"However, by time he ascended to power, the Mongol Empire had already dissolved, dividing into different factions."
"Arriving with an army, he established himself in the region and founded the Ilkhanate, a breakaway state of the Mongol Empire, which would rule Iran for the next eighty years and become Persian in the process."
Hulagu Khan seized Baghdad in 1258 and put the last Abbasid caliph to death.
"The westward advance of his forces was stopped by the Mamelukes, however, at the Battle of Ain Jalut in Palestine in 1260."
"The rule of Hulagu's great-grandson, Ghazan (1295–1304) saw the establishment of Islam as the state religion of the Ilkhanate."
"Ghazan and his famous Iranian vizier, Rashid al-Din, brought Iran a partial and brief economic revival."
"The Mongols lowered taxes for artisans, encouraged agriculture, rebuilt and extended irrigation works, and improved the safety of the trade routes."
"Items from India, China, and Iran passed easily across the Asian steppes, and these contacts culturally enriched Iran."
"For example, Iranians developed a new style of painting based on a unique fusion of solid, two-dimensional Mesopotamian painting with the feathery, light brush strokes and other motifs characteristic of China."
"After Ghazan's nephew Abu Said died in 1335, however, the Ilkhanate lapsed into civil war and was divided between several petty dynasties – most prominently the Jalayirids, Muzaffarids, Sarbadars and Kartids."
The mid-14th-century Black Death killed about 30% of the country's population.
According to Mortaza Motahhari the majority of Iranian scholars and masses remained Sunni until the time of the Safavids.
The domination of Sunnis did not mean Shia were rootless in Iran.
"The writers of The Four Books of Shia were Iranian, as well as many other great Shia scholars."
The domination of the Sunni creed during the first nine Islamic centuries characterized the religious history of Iran during this period.
"During this period, Shia in Iran were nourished from Kufah, Baghdad and later from Najaf and Hillah."
"Shiism was the dominant sect in Tabaristan, Qom, Kashan, Avaj and Sabzevar."
In many other areas merged population of Shia and Sunni lived together.
"During the 10th and 11th centuries,  Fatimids sent Ismailis Da'i (missioners) to Iran as well as other Muslim lands."
"When Ismailis divided into two sects, Nizaris established their base in Iran."
Hassan-i Sabbah conquered fortresses and captured  Alamut in 1090 AD.
"After the Mongol raid and fall of the Abbasids, Sunni hierarchies faltered."
Not only did they lose the caliphate but also the status of official madhhab.
"Their loss was the gain of Shia, whose centre wasn't in Iran at that time."
Several local Shia dynasties like Sarbadars were established during this time.
"The main change occurred in the beginning of the 16th century, when Ismail I founded the Safavid dynasty and initiated a religious policy to recognize Shi'a Islam as the official religion of the Safavid Empire, and the fact that modern Iran remains an officially Shi'ite state is a direct result of Ismail's actions."
"Like its predecessors, the Timurid Empire was also part of the Persianate world."
"After establishing a power base in Transoxiana, Timur  invaded Iran in 1381 and eventually conquered most of it."
Timur's campaigns were known for their brutality; many people were slaughtered and several cities were destroyed.
"His regime was characterized by tyranny and bloodshed, but also by its inclusion of Iranians in administrative roles and its promotion of architecture and poetry."
"His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until 1452, when they lost the bulk of it to Black Sheep Turkmen."
Sufis were often persecuted by orthodox Muslims who considered their teachings blasphemous.
Sufism developed a symbolic language rich with metaphors to obscure poetic references to provocative philosophical teachings.
"Hafez concealed his own Sufi faith, even as he employed the secret language of Sufism (developed over hundreds of years) in his own work, and he is sometimes credited with having ""brought it to perfection""."
"His work was imitated by Jami, whose own popularity grew to spread across the full breadth of the Persianate world."
"The Kara Koyunlu expanded their conquest to Baghdad, however, internal fighting, defeats by the Timurids, rebellions by the Armenians in response to their persecution, and failed struggles with the Ag Qoyunlu led to their eventual demise."
Aq Qoyunlu emerged when Timur granted them all of Diyar Bakr in present-day Turkey.
"Afterward, they struggled with their rival Oghuz Turks, the Kara Koyunlu."
"While the Aq Qoyunlu were successful in defeating Kara Koyunlu, their struggle with the emerging Safavid dynasty led to their downfall."
"They ruled one of the greatest Persian empires after the Muslim conquest of Persia and established the Twelver school of Shi'a Islam as the official religion of their empire, marking one of the most important turning points in Muslim history."
"Safavid Iran was one of the Islamic ""gunpowder empires"", along with its neighbours, its archrival and principal enemy the Ottoman Empire, as well as the Mughal Empire."
"Practically worshipped by his Qizilbāsh followers, Ismāil invaded Shirvan to avenge the death of his father, Shaykh Haydar, who had been killed during his siege of Derbent, in Dagestan."
"A year after his victory in Tabriz, Ismāil proclaimed most of Persia as his domain, and quickly conquered and unified Iran under his rule."
"Soon afterwards, the new Safavid Empire rapidly conquered regions, nations, and peoples in all directions, including Armenia, Azerbaijan, parts of Georgia, Mesopotamia (Iraq), Kuwait, Syria, Dagestan, large parts of what is now Afghanistan, parts of Turkmenistan, and large chunks of Anatolia, laying the foundation of its multi-ethnic character which would heavily influence the empire itself (most notably the Caucasus and its peoples)."
"Tahmasp I, the son and successor of Ismail I, carried out multiple invasions in the Caucasus which had been incorporated in the Safavid empire since Shah Ismail I and for many centuries afterwards, and started with the trend of deporting and moving hundreds of thousands of Circassians, Georgians, and Armenians to Iran's heartlands."
"Initially only solely put in the royal harems, royal guards, and minor other sections of the Empire, Tahmasp believed he could eventually reduce the power of the Qizilbash, by creating and fully integrating a new layer in Iranian society."
"As Encyclopædia Iranica states, for Tahmasp, the problem circled around the military tribal elite of the empire, the Qizilbash, who believed that physical proximity to and control of a member of the immediate Safavid family guaranteed spiritual advantages, political fortune, and material advancement."
"With this new Caucasian layer in Iranian society, the undisputed might of the Qizilbash (who functioned much like the ghazis of the neighbouring Ottoman Empire) would be questioned and fully diminished as society would become fully meritocratic."
"Shah Abbas I and his successors would significantly expand this policy and plan initiated by Tahmasp, deporting during his reign alone around some 200,000 Georgians, 300,000 Armenians and 100,000–150,000 Circassians to Iran, completing the foundation of a new layer in Iranian society."
"With this, and the complete systematic disorganisation of the Qizilbash by his personal orders, he eventually fully succeeded in replacing the power of the Qizilbash, with that of the Caucasian ghulams."
"The other masses of Caucasians were deployed in all other possible functions and positions available in the empire, as well as in the harem, regular military, craftsmen, farmers, etc."
This system of mass usage of Caucasian subjects remained to exist until the fall of the Qajar Dynasty.
"Abbas I first fought the Uzbeks, recapturing Herat and Mashhad in 1598, which had been lost by his predecessor Mohammad Khodabanda by the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590)."
"Then he turned against the Ottomans, the archrivals of the Safavids, recapturing Baghdad, eastern Iraq and the Caucasian provinces and beyond by 1618."
"His new army, which had dramatically been improved with the advent of Robert Shirley and his brothers following the first diplomatic mission to Europe, pitted the first crushing victory over the Safavids' archrivals, the Ottomans in the above-mentioned 1603–1618 war and would surpass the Ottomans in military strength."
"He also used his new force to dislodge the Portuguese from Bahrain (1602) and Hormuz (1622) with aid of the English navy, in the Persian Gulf."
"He expanded commercial links with the Dutch East India Company and established firm links with the European royal houses, which had been initiated by Ismail I earlier on by the Habsburg–Persian alliance."
Thus Abbas I was able to break the dependence on the Qizilbash for military might and therefore was able to centralize control.
"The Safavid dynasty had already established itself during Shah Ismail I, but under Abbas I it really became a major power in the world along with its archrival the Ottoman Empire, against whom it became able to compete with on equal foot."
It also started the promotion of tourism in Iran.
"Under their rule Persian Architecture flourished again and saw many new monuments in various Iranian cities, of which Isfahan is the most notable example."
"Except for Shah Abbas the Great, Shah Ismail I, Shah Tahmasp I, and Shah Abbas II, many of the Safavid rulers were ineffectual, often being more interested in their women, alcohol and other leisure activities."
"Despite falling revenues and military threats, many of the later shahs had lavish lifestyles."
"Finally, Ghilzai Pashtun chieftain named Mir Wais Khan began a rebellion in Kandahar and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, Gurgin Khan."
Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia.
"Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves."
"By these events, the Safavid dynasty had effectively ended."
"He defeated and banished the Afghans, defeated the Ottomans, reinstalled the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Iran's Caucasian territories, with the Treaty of Resht and Treaty of Ganja."
Nader was one of the last great conquerors of Asia and briefly presided over what was probably the most powerful empire in the world.
"To financially support his wars against Persia's arch-rival, the Ottoman Empire, he fixed his sights on the weak but rich Mughal Empire to the east."
"On his way back, he also conquered all the Uzbek khanates – except for Kokand – and made the Uzbeks his vassals."
"He also firmly re-established Persian rule over the entire Caucasus, Bahrain, as well as large parts of Anatolia and Mesopotamia."
"Undefeated for years, his defeat in Dagestan, following guerrilla rebellions by the Lezgins and the assassination attempt on him near Mazandaran is often considered the turning point in Nader's impressive career."
"To his frustration, the Dagestanis resorted to guerrilla warfare, and Nader with his conventional army could make little headway against them."
"At the Battle of Andalal and the Battle of Avaria, Nader's army was crushingly defeated and he lost half of his entire force, as well forcing him to flee for the mountains."
"Though Nader managed to take most of Dagestan during his campaign, the effective guerrilla warfare as deployed by the Lezgins, but also the Avars and Laks made the Iranian re-conquest of the particular North Caucasian region this time a short lived one; several years later, Nader was forced to withdraw."
"Around the same time, the assassination attempt was made on him near Mazandaran which accelerated the course of history; he slowly grew ill and megalomaniac, blinding his sons whom he suspected of the assassination attempts, and showing increasing cruelty against his subjects and officers."
"Nader's own family, the Afsharids, were soon reduced to holding on to a small domain in Khorasan."
Many of the Caucasian territories broke away in various Caucasian khanates.
Ottomans regained lost territories in Anatolia and Mesopotamia.
Oman and the Uzbek khanates of Bukhara and Khiva regained independence.
"Ahmad Shah Durrani, one of Nader's officers, founded an independent state which eventually became modern Afghanistan."
"Erekle II assumed control over Kartli after Teimuraz II's death, thus unifying the two as the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti, becoming the first Georgian ruler in three centuries to preside over a politically unified eastern Georgia, and due to the frantic turn of events in mainland Iran he would be able to remain de facto autonomous through the Zand period."
"From his capital Shiraz, Karim Khan of the Zand dynasty ruled ""an island of relative calm and peace in an otherwise bloody and destructive period,"" however the extent of Zand power was confined to contemporary Iran and parts of the Caucasus."
"During the civil war, Iran permanently lost Basra in 1779 to the Ottomans, which had been captured during the Ottoman–Persian War (1775–76), and Bahrain to Al Khalifa family after Bani Utbah invasion in 1783."
His reign is noted for the reemergence of a centrally led and united Iran.
"After the death of Nader Shah and the last of the Zands, most of Iran's Caucasian territories had broken away into various Caucasian khanates."
"Agha Mohammad Khan, like the Safavid kings and Nader Shah before him, viewed the region as no different than the territories in mainland Iran."
"Therefore, his first objective after having secured mainland Iran, was to reincorpate the Caucasus region into Iran."
Georgia was seen as one of the most integral territories.
"For Agha Mohammad Khan, the resubjugation and reintegration of Georgia into the Iranian Empire was part of the same process that had brought Shiraz, Isfahan, and Tabriz under his rule."
"As the Cambridge History of Iran states, its permanent secession was inconceivable and had to be resisted in the same way as one would resist an attempt at the separation of Fars or Gilan."
"The Ottomans, Iran's neighboring rival, recognized the latter's rights over Kartli and Kakheti for the first time in four centuries."
"Heraclius appealed then to his theoretical protector, Empress Catherine II of Russia, pleading for at least 3,000 Russian troops, but he was ignored, leaving Georgia to fend off the Persian threat alone."
"Nevertheless, Heraclius II still rejected the Khan's ultimatum."
"As a response, Agha Mohammad Khan invaded the Caucasus region after crossing the Aras river, and, while on his way to Georgia, he re-subjugated Iran's territories of the Erivan Khanate, Shirvan, Nakhchivan Khanate, Ganja khanate, Derbent Khanate, Baku khanate, Talysh Khanate, Shaki Khanate, Karabakh Khanate, which comprise modern-day Armenia, Azerbaijan, Dagestan, and Igdir."
"Having reached Georgia with his large army, he prevailed in the Battle of Krtsanisi, which resulted in the capture and sack of Tbilisi, as well as the effective resubjugation of Georgia."
"Upon his return from his successful campaign in Tbilisi and in effective control over Georgia, together with some 15,000 Georgian captives that were moved back to mainland Iran, Agha Mohammad was formally crowned Shah in 1796 in the Mughan plain, just as his predecessor Nader Shah was about sixty years earlier."
Agha Mohammad Shah was later assassinated while preparing a second expedition against Georgia in 1797 in Shusha (now part of the Republic of Azerbaijan) and the seasoned king Heraclius died early in 1798.
The reassertion of Iranian hegemony over Georgia did not last long; in 1799 the Russians marched into Tbilisi.
"The Russians were already actively occupied with an expansionist policy towards its neighboring empires to its south, namely the Ottoman Empire and the successive Iranian kingdoms since the late 17th/early 18th century."
"The next two years following Russia's entrance into Tbilisi were a time of confusion, and the weakened and devastated Georgian kingdom, with its capital half in ruins, was easily absorbed by Russia in 1801."
"As Iran could not permit or allow the cession of Transcaucasia and Dagestan, which had been an integral part of Iran for centuries, this would lead directly to the wars of several years later, namely the Russo-Persian Wars of 1804-1813 and 1826-1828."
"Following the 1804-1814 War, but also per the 1826-1828 war which ceded the last territories, large migrations, so-called Caucasian Muhajirs, set off to migrate to mainland Iran."
"During the remaining part of the 1804-1813 war, as well as through the 1826-1828 war, a large number of the Ayrums and Qarapapaqs that were still remaining in newly conquered Russian territories were settled in and migrated to Solduz (in modern-day Iran's West Azerbaijan province)."
"As the Cambridge History of Iran states; ""The steady encroachment of Russian troops along the frontier in the Caucasus, General Yermolov's brutal punitive expeditions and misgovernment, drove large numbers of Muslims, and even some Georgian Christians, into exile in Iran."
"Others simply voluntarily refused to live under Christian Russian rule, and thus departed for Turkey or Iran."
"These migrations once again, towards Iran, included masses of Caucasian Azerbaijanis, other Transcaucasian Muslims, as well as many North Caucasian Muslims, such as Circassians, Shia Lezgins and Laks."
"Many of these migrants would prove to play a pivotal role in further Iranian history, as they formed most of the ranks of the Persian Cossack Brigade, which was established in the late 19th century."
The initial ranks of the brigade would be entirely composed of Circassians and other Caucasian Muhajirs.
This brigade would prove decisive in the following decades in Qajar history.
"Until the mid-fourteenth century, Armenians had constituted a majority in Eastern Armenia."
"At the close of the fourteenth century, after Timur's campaigns, the Timurid Renaissance flourished, and Islam had become the dominant faith, and Armenians became a minority in Eastern Armenia."
"After centuries of constant warfare on the Armenian Plateau, many Armenians chose to emigrate and settle elsewhere."
"Following Shah Abbas I's massive relocation of Armenians and Muslims in 1604–05, their numbers dwindled even further."
"At the time of the Russian invasion of Iran, some 80% of the population of Iranian Armenia were Muslims (Persians, Turkics, and Kurds) whereas Christian Armenians constituted a minority of about 20%."
"After the Russian administration took hold of Iranian Armenia, the ethnic make-up shifted, and thus for the first time in more than four centuries, ethnic Armenians started to form a majority once again in one part of historic Armenia."
The new Russian administration encouraged the settling of ethnic Armenians from Iran proper and Ottoman Turkey.
"It would be only after the Crimean War and the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, which brought another influx of Turkish Armenians, that ethnic Armenians once again established a solid majority in Eastern Armenia."
"Nevertheless, the city of Erivan retained a Muslim majority up to the twentieth century."
"His grandson Mohammad Shah, who succeeded him in 1834, fell under the Russian influence and made two unsuccessful attempts to capture Herat."
He founded the first modern hospital in Iran.
"The Shah managed to remain in power, granting a limited constitution in 1906 (making the country a constitutional monarchy)."
"Control of Persia remained contested between the United Kingdom and Russia, in what became known as The Great Game, and codified in the Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907, which divided Persia into spheres of influence, regardless of her national sovereignty."
"During World War I, the country was occupied by British, Ottoman and Russian forces but was essentially neutral (see Persian Campaign)."
"In 1919, after the Russian revolution and their withdrawal, Britain attempted to establish a protectorate in Persia, which was unsuccessful."
"Finally, the Constitutionalist movement of Gilan and the central power vacuum caused by the instability of the Qajar government resulted in the rise of Reza Khan, who was later to become Reza Shah Pahlavi, and the subsequent establishment of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925."
"The coup was not actually directed at the Qajar monarchy; according to Encyclopædia Iranica, it was targeted at officials who were in power and actually had a role in controlling the government; the cabinet and others who had a role in governing Persia."
"In 1925, after being prime minister for two years, Reza Khan became the first shah of the Pahlavi dynasty."
"He established an authoritarian government that valued nationalism, militarism, secularism and anti-communism combined with strict censorship and state propaganda."
Many of the new laws and regulations created resentment among devout Muslims and the clergy.
"For example, mosques were required to use chairs; most men were required to wear western clothing, including a hat with a brim; women were encouraged to discard the hijab; men and women were allowed to freely congregate, violating Islamic mixing of the sexes."
Dozens were killed and hundreds were injured when troops finally quelled the unrest.
It rejected British and Russian demands to expel the Germans.
"In response the Allies invaded in August 1941, and easily overwhelmed the weak Iranian army in Operation Countenance."
Iran became the major conduit of Allied Lend-Lease aid to the Soviet Union.
The purpose was to secure Iranian oil fields and ensure Allied supply lines (see Persian Corridor) .
Iran remained officially neutral.
"However, when the war actually ended, Soviet troops stationed in northwestern Iran not only refused to withdraw but backed revolts that established short-lived, pro-Soviet separatist national states in the northern regions of Azerbaijan and Iranian Kurdistan, the Azerbaijan People's Government and the Republic of Kurdistan respectively, in late 1945."
Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946 after receiving a promise of oil concessions.
The Soviet republics in the north were soon overthrown and the oil concessions were revoked.
"The new, young Shah Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi initially took a very hands-off role in government, and allowed parliament to hold a lot of power."
"Some elections were held in the first shaky years, although they remained mired in corruption."
"Parliament became chronically unstable, and from the 1947 to 1951 period Iran saw the rise and fall of six different prime ministers."
"Pahlavi increased his political power by convening the Iran Constituent Assembly, 1949, which finally formed the Senate of Iran—a legislative upper house allowed for in the 1906 constitution but never brought into being."
"The new senators were largely supportive of Pahlavi, as he had intended."
"In 1951 Prime Minister Mohammed Mosaddeq received the vote required from the parliament to nationalize the British-owned oil industry, in a situation known as the Abadan Crisis."
"Despite British pressure, including an economic blockade, the nationalization continued."
"Mosaddeq was briefly removed from power in 1952 but was quickly re-appointed by the shah, due to a popular uprising in support of the premier and he, in turn, forced the Shah into a brief exile in August 1953 after a failed military coup by Imperial Guard Colonel Nematollah Nassiri."
Mosaddeq was arrested and tried for treason.
"Found guilty, his sentence reduced to house arrest on his family estate while his foreign minister, Hossein Fatemi, was executed."
"Zahedi succeeded him as prime minister, and suppressed opposition to the Shah, specifically the National Front and Communist Tudeh Party."
Iran was ruled as an autocracy under the shah with American support from that time until the revolution.
The Iranian government entered into agreement with an international consortium of foreign companies which ran the Iranian oil facilities for the next 25 years splitting profits fifty-fifty with Iran but not allowing Iran to audit their accounts or have members on their board of directors.
The core of this program was land reform.
"Modernization and economic growth proceeded at an unprecedented rate, fueled by Iran's vast petroleum reserves, the third-largest in the world."
"However the reforms, including the White Revolution, did not greatly improve economic conditions and the liberal pro-Western policies alienated certain Islamic religious and political groups."
"Two years later, premier Hassan Ali Mansur was assassinated and the internal security service, SAVAK, became more violently active."
"In the 1970s leftist guerilla groups such as Mujaheddin-e-Khalq (MEK), emerged and attacked regime and foreign targets."
Nearly a hundred Iran political prisoners were killed by the SAVAK during the decade before the revolution and many more were arrested and tortured.
"Bilateral relations with its neighbor Iraq were not good, mainly due to a dispute over the Shatt al-Arab waterway."
"In mid-1973, the Shah returned the oil industry to national control."
"Instead, it used the situation to raise oil prices, using the money gained for modernization and to increase defense spending."
"A border dispute between Iraq and Iran was resolved with the signing of the Algiers Accord on March 6, 1975."
"Its unique constitution is based on the concept of velayat-e faqih the idea advanced by Khomeini that Muslims – in fact everyone – requires ""guardianship"", in the form of rule or supervision by the leading Islamic jurist or jurists."
"Khomeini served as this ruling jurist, or supreme leader,  until his death in 1989."
"Iran's rapidly modernising, capitalist economy was replaced by populist and Islamic economic and cultural policies."
"Much industry was nationalized, laws and schools Islamicized, and Western influences banned."
The Islamic revolution also created great impact around the world.
"In the non-Muslim world it has changed the image of Islam, generating much interest in the politics and spirituality of Islam, along with ""fear and distrust towards Islam"" and particularly the Islamic Republic and its founder."
"This era was dominated by the consolidation of the revolution into a theocratic republic under Khomeini, and by the costly and bloody war with Iraq."
Many political opponents were executed by the new regimes.
"Following the events of the revolution, Marxist guerrillas and federalist parties revolted in some regions comprising Khuzistan, Kurdistan and Gonbad-e Qabus, which resulted in severe fighting between rebels and revolutionary forces."
"The Kurdish uprising, led by the KDPI, was the most violent, lasting until 1983 and resulting in 10,000 casualties."
The new constitution was approved by referendum in December 1979.
"Following the admitting of the former Shah of Iran into the United States for cancer treatment, on November 4, 1979, Iranian students seized US embassy personnel, labeling the embassy a ""den of spies."""
"It was at this time that Khomeini began referring to America as the ""Great Satan."""
"In America, where it was considered a violation of the long-standing principle of international law that diplomats may be expelled but not held captive, it created a powerful anti-Iranian backlash."
Relations between the two countries have remained deeply antagonistic and American international sanctions have hurt Iran's economy.
"The once-strong Iranian military had been disbanded during the revolution, and with the Shah ousted, Hussein had ambitions to position himself as the new strong man of the Middle East, and sought to expand Iraq's access to the Persian Gulf by acquiring territories that Iraq had claimed earlier from Iran during the Shah's rule."
"Of chief importance to Iraq was Khuzestan which not only boasted a substantial Arab population, but rich oil fields as well."
"On the unilateral behalf of the United Arab Emirates, the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs became objectives as well."
"With these ambitions in mind, Hussein planned a full-scale assault on Iran, boasting that his forces could reach the capital within three days."
The attack took revolutionary Iran completely by surprise.
"Although Saddam Hussein's forces made several early advances, Iranian forces had pushed the Iraqi army back into Iraq by 1982."
"Khomeini sought to export his Islamic revolution westward into Iraq, especially on the majority Shi'a Arabs living in the country."
"The war then continued for six more years until 1988, when Khomeini, in his words, ""drank the cup of poison"" and accepted a truce mediated by the United Nations."
Tens of thousands of Iranian civilians and military personnel were killed when Iraq used chemical weapons in its warfare.
"Iraq was financially backed by Egypt, the Arab countries of the Persian Gulf, the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact states, the United States (beginning in 1983), France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Brazil, and the People's Republic of China (which also sold weapons to Iran)."
"The total Iranian casualties of the war were estimated to be between 500,000 and 1,000,000."
"The main target was the membership of the People's Mojahedin Organization of Iran (PMOI), although a lesser number of political prisoners from other leftist groups were also included such as the Tudeh Party of Iran (Communist Party)."
"While Khamenei lacked Khomeini's ""charisma and clerical standing"", he developed a network of supporters within Iran's armed forces and its economically powerful religious foundations."
"""Succeeding Khamenei as president was pragmatic conservative Ali-Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who served two four-year terms and focused his efforts on rebuilding Iran's economy and war-damaged infrastructure though low oil prices hampered this endeavor."
"He sought to restore confidence in the government among the general population by privatizing the companies that had been nationalized in the first few years of the Islamic Republic, as well as by bringing in qualified technocrats to manage the economy."
The state of their economy also influenced the government to move towards ending their diplomatic isolation.
This was achieved through the reestablishment of normalized relations with neighbors such as Saudi Arabia and an attempt to improve its reputation in the region with assertions that its revolution was not exportable to other states.
"Iran in the 1990s had a greater secular behavior and admiration for Western popular culture than in the previous decades, it had become a way in which the urban population expressed their resentment at the invasive Islamic policies of the government."
"The pressures from the population placed on the new Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei led to an uneasy alliance between him and President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani."
Through this alliance they attempted to hinder the ulama's ability to gain further control of the state.
"In 1989, they created a sequence of constitutional amendments that removed the office of prime minister and increased the scope of presidential power."
"However, these new amendments did not curtail the powers of the Supreme Leader of Iran in any way; this position still contained the ultimate authority over the armed forces, the making of war and peace, the final say in foreign policy, and the right to intervene in the legislative process whenever he deemed it necessary."
"This led to the defeat of the government's candidate for president in 1997, who had the backing of the supreme Islamic jurist."
"He was beaten by an independent candidate from the reformist,  Mohammad Khatami."
He received 69% of the vote and enjoyed particular support from two groups of the population that had felt ostracized by the practices of the state: women and youth.
"The younger generations in the country had been too young to experience the shah's regime or the revolution that ended it, and now they resented the restrictions placed on their daily lives under the Islamic Republic."
Mohammad Khatami's presidency was soon marked by tensions between the reform-minded government and an increasingly conservative and vocal clergy.
The disturbances lasted over a week before police and pro-government vigilantes dispersed the crowds.
"Conservative elements within Iran's government moved to undermine the reformist movement, banning liberal newspapers and disqualifying candidates for parliamentary elections."
"This clampdown on dissent, combined with the failure of Khatami to reform the government, led to growing political apathy among Iran's youth."
"In June 2003, anti-government protests by several thousand students took place in Tehran."
China and Russia opposed military action of any sort and opposed economic sanctions.
"Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding the production, stockpiling and use of nuclear weapons."
The resulting social unrest is widely known as the Iranian Green Movement.
Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and other Islamic officials blamed foreign powers for fomenting the protest.
"In his press conference one day after election day, Rouhani reiterated his promise to recalibrate Iran's relations with the world."
"On April 2, 2015, following eight days of tortuous discussions in Switzerland, which lasted through the night to Thursday, Iran and six world powers (United States, United Kingdom, France, China and Russia plus Germany) agreed on the outlines of an understanding to limit Iran's nuclear programs, negotiators indicated, as both sides prepared for announcements."
European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini tweeted that she would meet the press with Zarif after a final meeting of the seven nations in the nuclear talks.
"Reading out a joint statement, European Union foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini hailed what she called a ""decisive step"" after more than a decade of work."
Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif followed with the same statement in Persian.
"When Donald Trump was campaigning to become President of the US, he repeatedly said he would abandon the Iran nuclear deal."
"Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the Eastern and Northern Hemispheres."
It shares the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe and the continental landmass of Afro-Eurasia with both Europe and Africa.
"The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations."
"Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements, as well as vast barely populated regions."
"The border of Asia with Europe is a historical and cultural construct, as there is no clear physical and geographical separation between them."
It is somewhat arbitrary and has moved since its first conception in classical antiquity.
"The division of Eurasia into two continents reflects East–West cultural, linguistic, and ethnic differences, some of which vary on a spectrum rather than with a sharp dividing line."
"China was a major economic power and attracted many to the east, and for many the legendary wealth and prosperity of the ancient culture of India personified Asia, attracting European commerce, exploration and colonialism."
The accidental discovery of a trans-Atlantic route from Europe to America by Columbus while in search for a route to India demonstrates this deep fascination.
The Silk Road became the main east–west trading route in the Asian hinterlands while the Straits of Malacca stood as a major sea route.
"Asia has exhibited economic dynamism (particularly East Asia) as well as robust population growth during the 20th century, but overall population growth has since fallen."
"Asia was the birthplace of most of the world's mainstream religions including Hinduism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Jainism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism, Christianity, Islam, Sikhism, as well as many other religions."
"Given its size and diversity, the concept of Asia—a name dating back to classical antiquity—may actually have more to do with human geography than physical geography."
"Asia varies greatly across and within its regions with regard to ethnic groups, cultures, environments, economics, historical ties and government systems."
"It also has a mix of many different climates ranging from the equatorial south via the hot desert in the Middle East, temperate areas in the east and the  continental centre to vast subarctic and polar areas in Siberia."
"This makes Egypt a transcontinental country, with the Sinai peninsula in Asia and the remainder of the country in Africa."
"Anaximander placed the boundary between Asia and Europe along the Phasis River (the modern Rioni river) in Georgia of Caucasus (from its mouth by Poti on the Black Sea coast, through the Surami Pass and along the Kura River to the Caspian Sea), a convention still followed by Herodotus in the 5th century BC."
"During the Hellenistic period, this convention was revised, and the boundary between Europe and Asia was now considered to be the Tanais (the modern Don River)."
"This is the convention used by Roman era authors such as Posidonius, Strabo and Ptolemy."
The border between Asia and Europe was historically defined by European academics.
"The Don River became unsatisfactory to northern Europeans when Peter the Great, king of the Tsardom of Russia, defeating rival claims of Sweden and the Ottoman Empire to the eastern lands, and armed resistance by the tribes of Siberia, synthesized a new Russian Empire extending to the Ural Mountains and beyond, founded in 1721."
Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg.
The latter had suggested the Emba River as the lower boundary.
Over the next century various proposals were made until the Ural River prevailed in the mid-19th century.
The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.
"The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the Caucasus Mountains, although it is sometimes placed further north."
"The Maluku Islands in Indonesia are often considered to lie on the border of southeast Asia, with New Guinea, to the east of the islands, being wholly part of Oceania."
"The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception."
The chief factor in determining which islands of the Malay Archipelago are Asian has been the location of the colonial possessions of the various empires there (not all European).
"Asia, Europe and Africa make up a single continuous landmass—Afro-Eurasia (except for the Suez Canal)—and share a common continental shelf."
"Almost all of Europe and a major part of Asia sit atop the Eurasian Plate, adjoined on the south by the Arabian and Indian Plate and with the easternmost part of Siberia (east of the Chersky Range) on the North American Plate."
"The English word comes from Latin literature, where it has the same form, ""Asia""."
"Whether ""Asia"" in other languages comes from Latin of the Roman Empire is much less certain, and the ultimate source of the Latin word is uncertain, though several theories have been published."
One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was Pliny.
"This metonymical change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as Scandinavia (from Scania)."
"Prior to then in the Bronze Age the records of the Assyrian Empire, the Hittite Empire and the various Mycenaean states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia."
These records are administrative and do not include poetry.
The Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200 BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the Dorian invasion to this time.
"The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called Linear B, deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, Michael Ventris, subsequently assisted by the scholar, John Chadwick."
A major cache discovered by Carl Blegen at the site of ancient Pylos included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.
Some of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals).
"They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children."
"The epithet lawiaiai, ""captives"", associated with some of them identifies their origin."
"Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of Miletus, a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks."
Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.
"The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female from there."
"There is a masculine form, aswios."
"This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or ""Roman Asia""."
"This name, Assuwa, has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent ""Asia""."
"The Assuwa league was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the Hittites under Tudhaliya I around 1400 BCE."
"Alternatively, the etymology of the term may be from the Akkadian word (w)aṣû(m), which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word asa meaning 'east'."
"This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for Europe, as being from Akkadian erēbu(m) 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun)."
"Reid supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from asu, meaning 'east' in Assyrian (ereb for Europe meaning 'west')."
"The ideas of Occidental (form Latin occidens 'setting') and Oriental (from Latin oriens for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with Western and Eastern."
"Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and Eastern civilizations on the Eurasian continent."
Kazuo Ogura and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.
"The Romans named a province Asia, located in western Anatolia (in modern-day Turkey)."
There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day Iraq.
"As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from Ἀσία, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act."
"The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as Herodotus, who were all Greek."
"He defines it carefully, mentioning the previous geographers whom he had read, but whose works are now missing."
"By it he means Anatolia and the Persian Empire, in contrast to Greece and Egypt."
"Hesione), but that the Lydians say it was named after Asies, son of Cotys, who passed the name on to a tribe at Sardis."
"The poets detailed their doings and generations in allegoric language salted with entertaining stories, which subsequently playwrights transformed into classical Greek drama and became ""Greek mythology""."
"For example, Hesiod mentions the daughters of Tethys and Ocean, among whom are a ""holy company"", ""who with the Lord Apollo and the Rivers have youths in their keeping""."
"The Iliad (attributed by the ancient Greeks to Homer) mentions two Phrygians (the tribe that replaced the Luvians in Lydia) in the Trojan War named Asios (an adjective meaning ""Asian""); and also a marsh or lowland containing a marsh in Lydia as ασιος."
"According to many Muslims, the term came from Ancient Egypt's Queen Asiya, the adoptive mother of Moses."
"The coastal periphery was home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations, each of them developing around fertile river valleys."
"The civilizations in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and the Yellow River shared many similarities."
These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel.
"Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area."
"Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands."
The central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the steppes.
"The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the Indo-Europeans, who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of China, where the Tocharians resided."
"The northernmost part of Asia, including much of Siberia, was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and tundra."
These areas remained very sparsely populated.
The center and the peripheries were mostly kept separated by mountains and deserts.
The Caucasus and Himalaya mountains and the Karakum and Gobi deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty.
"While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe."
"However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the nomads who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies."
The Islamic Caliphate's defeats of the Byzantine and Persian empires led to West Asia and southern parts of Central Asia and western parts of South Asia under its control during its conquests of the 7th century.
"The Mongol Empire conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe."
"The Ottoman Empire controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards."
"In the 17th century, the Manchu conquered China and established the Qing dynasty."
The Islamic Mughal Empire and the Hindu Maratha Empire controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.
"The Empire of Japan controlled most of East Asia and much of Southeast Asia, New Guinea and the Pacific islands until the end of World War II."
"It covers 9% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the longest coastline, at 62,800 kilometres (39,022 mi)."
Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of Eurasia.
"It is located to the east of the Suez Canal and the Ural Mountains, and south of the Caucasus Mountains (or the Kuma–Manych Depression) and the Caspian and Black Seas."
"It is bounded on the east by the Pacific Ocean, on the south by the Indian Ocean and on the north by the Arctic Ocean."
"Asia is subdivided into 49 countries, five of them (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Russia, Kazakhstan and Turkey) are transcontinental countries lying partly in Europe."
"Geographically, Russia is partly in Asia, but is considered a European nation, both culturally and politically."
The Gobi Desert is in Mongolia and the Arabian Desert stretches across much of the Middle East.
The Yangtze River in China is the longest river in the continent.
The Himalayas between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world.
Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.
"The following subdivision into regions is used, among others, by the UN statistics agency UNSD."
This division of Asia into regions by the United Nations is done solely for statistical reasons and does not imply any assumption about political or other affiliations of countries and territories.
Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia.
"It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior."
Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia.
"The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer."
Southwestern sections of the continent are hot.
"Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America."
The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan.
A survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm Maplecroft identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change.
"Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years."
"The Asian countries of Bangladesh, India, the Philippines, Vietnam, Thailand, Pakistan, China and Sri Lanka were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change."
"The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use renewable energy."
"According to economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy: A Millennial Perspective, India had the world's largest economy during 0 BCE and 1000 BCE."
"Historically, India was the largest economy in the world for most of the two millennia from the 1st until 19th century, contributing 25% of the world's industrial output."
China was the largest and most advanced economy on earth for much of recorded history and shared the mantle with India.
"For several decades in the late twentieth century Japan was the largest economy in Asia and second-largest of any single nation in the world, after surpassing the Soviet Union (measured in net material product) in 1990 and Germany in 1968."
"Economic growth in Asia since World War II to the 1990s had been concentrated in Japan as well as the four regions of South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore located in the Pacific Rim, known as the Asian tigers, which have now all received developed country status, having the highest GDP per capita in Asia."
It is forecasted that India will overtake Japan in terms of nominal GDP by 2025.
"Several trade blocs exist, with the most developed being the Association of Southeast Asian Nations."
"Asia is the largest continent in the world by a considerable margin, and it is rich in natural resources, such as petroleum, forests, fish, water, rice, copper and silver."
"Manufacturing in Asia has traditionally been strongest in East and Southeast Asia, particularly in China, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, India, the Philippines, and Singapore."
"Japan and South Korea continue to dominate in the area of multinational corporations, but increasingly the PRC and India are making significant inroads."
"Many companies from Europe, North America, South Korea and Japan have operations in Asia's developing countries to take advantage of its abundant supply of cheap labour and relatively developed infrastructure."
According to Citigroup 9 of 11 Global Growth Generators countries came from Asia driven by population and income growth.
"They are Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Mongolia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka and Vietnam."
"Asia has three main financial centers: Hong Kong, Tokyo and Singapore."
"Call centers and business process outsourcing (BPOs) are becoming major employers in India and the Philippines due to the availability of a large pool of highly skilled, English-speaking workers."
The increased use of outsourcing has assisted the rise of India and the China as financial centers.
"Due to its large and extremely competitive information technology industry, India has become a major hub for outsourcing."
Trade between Asian countries and countries on other continents is largely carried out on the sea routes that are important for Asia.
Individual main routes have emerged from this.
"The main route leads from the Chinese coast south via Hanoi to Jakarta, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur through the Strait of Malacca via the Sri Lankan Colombo to the southern tip of India via Malé to East Africa Mombasa, from there to Djibouti, then through the Red Sea over the Suez Canal into Mediterranean, there via Haifa, Istanbul and Athens to the upper Adriatic to the northern Italian hub of Trieste with its rail connections to Central and Eastern Europe or further to Barcelona and around Spain and France to the European northern ports."
A far smaller part of the goods traffic runs via South Africa to Europe.
A particularly significant part of the Asian goods traffic is carried out across the Pacific towards Los Angeles and Long Beach.
"In contrast to the sea routes, the Silk Road via the land route to Europe is on the one hand still under construction and on the other hand is much smaller in terms of scope."
Last year Asia had toppled Europe.
"Citigroup in The Wealth Report 2012 stated that Asian centa-millionaire overtook North America's wealth for the first time as the world's ""economic center of gravity"" continued moving east."
"More than four of every five children of school age in Nepal now attend primary school, compared to just one in five 40 years ago."
"Hong Kong ranked highest among the countries grouped on the HDI (number 7 in the world, which is in the ""very high human development"" category), followed by Singapore (9), Japan (19) and South Korea (22)."
Most Asian countries have more than one language that is natively spoken.
China has many languages and dialects in different provinces.
Asian mythology is complex and diverse.
"The story of the Great Flood for example, as presented to Jews in the Hebrew Bible in the narrative of Noah—and later to Christians in the Old Testament, and to Muslims in the Quran—is earliest found in Mesopotamian mythology, in the Enûma Eliš and Epic of Gilgamesh."
Hindu mythology similarly tells about an avatar of Vishnu in the form of a fish who warned Manu of a terrible flood.
"Ancient Chinese mythology also tells of a Great Flood spanning generations, one that required the combined efforts of emperors and divinities to control."
"Judaism, the oldest of the Abrahamic faiths, is practiced primarily in Israel, the indigenous homeland and historical birthplace of the Hebrew nation: which today consists both of those Jews who remained in the Middle East and those who returned from diaspora in Europe, North America, and other regions; though various diaspora communities persist worldwide."
"Outside of Israel there are small ancient Jewish communities in Turkey (17,400), Azerbaijan (9,100), Iran (8,756), India (5,000) and Uzbekistan (4,000), among many other places."
"Christianity is a widespread religion in Asia with more than 286 million adherents according to Pew Research Center in 2010, and nearly 364 million according to Britannica Book of the Year 2014."
"In the Philippines and East Timor, Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion; it was introduced by the Spaniards and the Portuguese, respectively."
"In Armenia, Georgia and Asian Russia, Eastern Orthodoxy is the predominant religion."
"In the Middle East, such as in the Levant, Syriac Christianity (Church of the East) and Oriental Orthodoxy are prevalent minority denominations, which are both Eastern Christian sects mainly adhered to Assyrian people or Syriac Christians."
"Mecca, Medina and Jerusalem are the three holiest cities for Islam in all the world."
The Hajj and Umrah attract large numbers of Muslim devotees from all over the world to Mecca and Medina.
Iran is the largest Shi'a country.
Indian philosophy includes Hindu philosophy and Buddhist philosophy.
"They include elements of nonmaterial pursuits, whereas another school of thought from India, Cārvāka, preached the enjoyment of the material world."
"The religions of Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism and Sikhism originated in India, South Asia."
"In East Asia, particularly in China and Japan, Confucianism, Taoism and Zen Buddhism took shape."
"However, it is mostly concentrated in South Asia."
"Many overseas Indians in countries such as Burma, Singapore and Malaysia also adhere to Hinduism."
Buddhism has a great following in mainland Southeast Asia and East Asia.
"In many Chinese communities, Mahayana Buddhism is easily syncretized with Taoism, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated."
"The Communist-governed countries of China, Vietnam and North Korea are officially atheist, thus the number of Buddhists and other religious adherents may be under-reported."
Jainism is found mainly in India and in oversea Indian communities such as the United States and Malaysia.
"Sikhism is found in Northern India and amongst overseas Indian communities in other parts of Asia, especially Southeast Asia."
"Confucianism is found predominantly in Mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan and in overseas Chinese populations."
"Taoism is found mainly in Mainland China, Taiwan, Malaysia and Singapore."
"Taoism is easily syncretized with Mahayana Buddhism for many Chinese, thus exact religious statistics is difficult to obtain and may be understated or overstated."
"He won his Nobel Prize in Literature for notable impact his prose works and poetic thought had on English, French, and other national literatures of Europe and the Americas."
He is also the writer of the national anthems of Bangladesh and India.
"Also, Mother Teresa of India and Shirin Ebadi of Iran were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their significant and pioneering efforts for democracy and human rights, especially for the rights of women and children."
Ebadi is the first Iranian and the first Muslim woman to receive the prize.
Another Nobel Peace Prize winner is Aung San Suu Kyi from Burma for her peaceful and non-violent struggle under a military dictatorship in Burma.
She is a nonviolent pro-democracy activist and leader of the National League for Democracy in Burma (Myanmar) and a noted prisoner of conscience.
She is a Buddhist and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991.
"Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for ""his long and non-violent struggle for fundamental human rights in China"" on 8 October 2010."
He is the first Chinese citizen to be awarded a Nobel Prize of any kind while residing in China.
"In 2014, Kailash Satyarthi from India and Malala Yousafzai from Pakistan were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize ""for their struggle against the suppression of children and young people and for the right of all children to education""."
"He won the Nobel Prize in Physics ""for his work on the scattering of light and for the discovery of the effect named after him""."
Japan has won the most Nobel Prizes of any Asian nation with 24 followed by India which has won 13.
He is internationally known for the concept of micro credit which allows poor and destitute people with little or no collateral to borrow money.
The borrowers typically pay back money within the specified period and the incidence of default is very low.
The Dalai Lama has received approximately eighty-four awards over his spiritual and political career.
"Imperialism is a policy or ideology of extending the rule over peoples and other countries, for extending political and economic access, power and control, often through employing hard power especially military force, but also soft power."
"While related to the concepts of colonialism and empire, imperialism is a distinct concept that can apply to other forms of expansion and many forms of government."
"Expansionism and centralisation have existed throughout recorded history by states, with the earliest examples dating back to the mid-third millennium BC."
"However, the concept of imperialism arose in the modern age, associated chiefly with the European colonial powers of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries and New Imperialism."
"Following the decolonization of European holdings, the concept has further evolved and has been broadly used to identify as well as criticise a range of policies and a number of states, including even supposedly anti-imperialist states."
"It first became common in the current sense in Great Britain during the 1870s, when it was used with a negative connotation."
"Previously, the term had been used to describe what was perceived as Napoleon III's attempts at obtaining political support through foreign military interventions."
"The term was and is mainly applied to Western and Japanese political and economic dominance, especially in Asia and Africa, in the 19th and 20th centuries."
Its precise meaning continues to be debated by scholars.
"Some writers, such as Edward Said, use the term more broadly to describe any system of domination and subordination organised around an imperial core and a periphery."
This definition encompasses both nominal empires and neocolonialism.
"Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's perceived superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people."
"Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the centre, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions."
"However, colonialism still includes invasion."
Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power.
"Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; ""imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.'"
"Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of another, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally."
Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism.
Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled.
Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war.
"The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance."
Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region.
"Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure, and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."
Few colonies remain remote from their mother country.
This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in the modern era.
Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations.
European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory.
The two main regions are the core and the periphery.
The core consists of areas of high income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit.
These critical theories of geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world.
"19th century episodes included the ""Scramble for Africa."""
Much more important was informal control of independent areas.
"Roger Louis, ""In their view, historians have been mesmerized by formal empire and maps of the world with regions colored red."
"The bulk of British emigration, trade, and capital went to areas outside the formal British Empire."
"Key to their thinking is the idea of empire 'informally if possible and formally if necessary.'"""
"Oron Hale says that Gallagher and Robinson looked at the British involvement in Africa where they ""found few capitalists, less capital, and not much pressure from the alleged traditional promoters of colonial expansion."
"Cabinet decisions to annex or not to annex were made, usually on the basis of political or geopolitical considerations."
"""Looking at the main empires from 1875 to 1914, there was a mixed record in terms of profitability."
"At first, planners expected that colonies would provide an excellent captive market for manufactured items."
"Apart from the Indian subcontinent, this was seldom true."
"By the 1890s, imperialists saw the economic benefit primarily in the production of inexpensive raw materials to feed the domestic manufacturing sector."
"Overall, Great Britain did very well in terms of profits from India, especially Mughal Bengal, but not from most of the rest of its empire."
The Netherlands did very well in the East Indies.
Germany and Italy got very little trade or raw materials from their empires.
France did slightly better.
The Belgian Congo was notoriously profitable when it was a capitalistic rubber plantation owned and operated by King Leopold II as a private enterprise.
"However, scandal after scandal regarding very badly mistreated labour led the international community to force the government of Belgium to take it over in 1908, and it became much less profitable."
"The colonization of India in the mid-18th century offers an example of this focus: there, the ""British exploited the political weakness of the Mughal state, and, while military activity was important at various times, the economic and administrative incorporation of local elites was also of crucial significance"" for the establishment of control over the subcontinent's resources, markets, and manpower."
"The second expansion of Europe was a complex historical process in which political, social and emotional forces in Europe and on the periphery were more influential than calculated imperialism."
"Individual colonies might serve an economic purpose; collectively no empire had any definable function, economic or otherwise."
Empires represented only a particular phase in the ever-changing relationship of Europe with the rest of the world: analogies with industrial systems or investment in real estate were simply misleading.
"During this time, European merchants had the ability to ""roam the high seas and appropriate surpluses from around the world (sometimes peaceably, sometimes violently) and to concentrate them in Europe""."
European expansion greatly accelerated in the 19th century.
"To obtain raw materials, Europe expanded imports from other countries and from the colonies."
"European industrialists sought raw materials such as dyes, cotton, vegetable oils, and metal ores from overseas."
"With the invention of railroads and telegraphs, it became easier to communicate with other countries and to extend the administrative control of a home nation over its colonies."
European chemists made new explosives that made artillery much more deadly.
"By the 1880s, the machine gun had become a reliable battlefield weapon."
"Some exceptions of armies that managed to get nearly on par with the European expeditions and standards include the Ethiopian armies at the Battle of Adwa, and the Japanese Imperial Army of Japan, but these still relied heavily on weapons imported from Europe and often on European military advisors."
The term imperialism was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli.
"Supporters of ""imperialism"" such as Joseph Chamberlain quickly appropriated the concept."
"For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed."
In Imperialism he argued that the financing of overseas empires drained money that was needed at home.
"It was invested abroad because of lower wages paid to the workers overseas made for higher profits and higher rates of return, compared to domestic wages."
"So although domestic wages remained higher, they did not grow nearly as fast as they might have otherwise."
"Exporting capital, he concluded, put a lid on the growth of domestic wages in the domestic standard of living."
The British experience failed to support it.
"However, European Socialists picked up Hobson's ideas and made it into their own theory of imperialism, most notably in Lenin's Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism (1916)."
"Lenin portrayed Imperialism as the closure of the world market and the end of capitalist free-competition that arose from the need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion."
"Later Marxist theoreticians echo this conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism, which explained the World War as the battle between imperialists for control of external markets."
"Such writers have expanded the period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades."
"As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal."
Much of the debate was pioneered by such theorists as J.
"While these non-Marxist writers were at their most prolific before World War I, they remained active in the interwar years."
"Their combined work informed the study of imperialism and its impact on Europe, as well as contributing to reflections on the rise of the military-political complex in the United States from the 1950s."
Hobson argued that domestic social reforms could cure the international disease of imperialism by removing its economic foundation.
"As a result, Imperialism ""for many years embraced the whole world – one part being the exploiters and the other the exploited, one part being dominated and the other acting as overlords, one part making policy and the other being dependent."
"""Imperialism has also been identified in newer phenomena like space development and its governing context."
"Defining the East as a negative vision of the Western world, as its inferior, not only increased the sense-of-self of the West, but also was a way of ordering the East, and making it known to the West, so that it could be dominated and controlled."
"Therefore, Orientalism was the ideological justification of early Western imperialism—a body of knowledge and ideas that rationalized social, cultural, political, and economic control of other, non-white peoples."
"Cartography is ""the art, science and technology of making maps"" but this definition is problematic."
It implies that maps are objective representations of the world when in reality they serve very political means.
"For Harley, maps serve as an example of Foucault's power and knowledge concept."
"He states that maps ""contributed to empire by promoting, assisting, and legitimizing the extension of French and British power into West Africa""."
"During his analysis of 19th-century cartographic techniques, he highlights the use of blank space to denote unknown or unexplored territory."
"According to Bassett, ""[n]ineteenth-century explorers commonly requested Africans to sketch maps of unknown areas on the ground."
"Many of those maps were highly regarded for their accuracy"" but were not printed in Europe unless Europeans verified them."
"One of such empires was the Roman Empire, the name giver to imperialism."
"a form of soft power, which changes the moral, cultural, and societal worldview of the subordinate country."
"This means more than just ""foreign"" music, television or film becoming popular with young people; rather that a populace changes its own expectations of life, desiring for their own country to become more like the foreign country depicted."
"For example, depictions of opulent American lifestyles in the soap opera Dallas during the Cold War changed the expectations of Romanians; a more recent example is the influence of smuggled South Korean drama series in North Korea."
"The importance of soft power is not lost on authoritarian regimes, fighting such influence with bans on foreign popular culture, control of the internet and unauthorised satellite dishes etc."
"Nor is such a usage of culture recent, as part of Roman imperialism local elites would be exposed to the benefits and luxuries of Roman culture and lifestyle, with the aim that they would then become willing participants."
"Imperialism has been subject to moral or immoral censure by its critics, and thus the term is frequently used in international propaganda as a pejorative for expansionist and aggressive foreign policy."
"They provided stability, security, and legal order for their subjects."
"They constrained, and at their best, tried to transcend, the potentially savage ethnic or religious antagonisms among the peoples."
"And the aristocracies which ruled most of them were often far more liberal, humane, and cosmopolitan than their supposedly ever more democratic successors."
A controversial aspect of imperialism is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds.
"In ancient China, Tianxia denoted the lands, space, and area divinely appointed to the Emperor by universal and well-defined principles of order."
"The center of this land was directly apportioned to the Imperial court, forming the center of a world view that centered on the Imperial court and went concentrically outward to major and minor officials and then the common citizens, tributary states, and finally ending with the fringe ""barbarians""."
Tianxia's idea of hierarchy gave Chinese a privileged position and was justified through the promise of order and peace.
Many others argued that imperialism is justified for several different reasons.
"Friedrich Ratzel believed that in order for a state to survive, imperialism was needed."
Halford Mackinder felt that Great Britain needed to be one of the greatest imperialists and therefore justified imperialism.
"The purportedly scientific nature of ""Social Darwinism"" and a theory of races formed a supposedly rational justification for imperialism."
They have the duty to civilize the inferior races.
"The rhetoric of colonizers being racially superior appears to have achieved its purpose, for example throughout Latin America ""whiteness"" is still prized today and various forms of blanqueamiento (whitening) are common."
The Royal Geographical Society of London and other geographical societies in Europe had great influence and were able to fund travelers who would come back with tales of their discoveries.
These societies also served as a space for travellers to share these stories.
Political geographers such as Friedrich Ratzel of Germany and Halford Mackinder of Britain also supported imperialism.
"For instance, American geographer Ellen Churchill Semple argued that even though human beings originated in the tropics they were only able to become fully human in the temperate zone."
"Tropicality can be paralleled with Edward Said's Orientalism as the west's construction of the east as the ""other""."
"The principles of imperialism are often generalizable to the policies and practices of the British Empire ""during the last generation, and proceeds rather by diagnosis than by historical description""."
British imperialism in some sparsely-inhabited regions appears to have applied a principle now termed Terra nullius (Latin expression which stems from Roman law meaning 'no man's land').
"The country of Australia serves as a case study in relation to British settlement and colonial rule of the continent in the 18th century, that was arguably premised on terra nullius, as its settlers considered it unused by its original inhabitants."
The environmental determinist school of thought held that the environment in which certain people lived determined those persons' behaviours; and thus validated their domination.
"For example, the Western world saw people living in tropical environments as ""less civilized"", therefore justifying colonial control as a civilizing mission."
"Across the three major waves of European colonialism (the first in the Americas, the second in Asia and the last in Africa), environmental determinism served to place categorically indigenous people in a racial hierarchy."
"This takes two forms, orientalism and tropicality."
Some geographic scholars under colonizing empires divided the world into climatic zones.
"These scholars believed that Northern Europe and the Mid-Atlantic temperate climate produced a hard-working, moral, and upstanding human being."
"In contrast, tropical climates allegedly yielded lazy attitudes, sexual promiscuity, exotic culture, and moral degeneracy."
The people of these climates were believed to be in need of guidance and intervention from a European empire to aid in the governing of a more evolved social structure; they were seen as incapable of such a feat.
"Similarly, orientalism could promote a view of a people based on their geographical location."
"Some anti-imperialist groups who opposed the United States supported the power of the Soviet Union, such as in Guevarism, while in Maoism this was criticized as social imperialism."
In 1599 the British East India Company was established and was chartered by Queen Elizabeth in the following year.
Most of these colonies were either aborted or collapsed quickly for various reasons.
"In 1767, the Anglo-Mysore Wars and other political activity caused exploitation of the East India Company causing the plundering of the local economy, almost bringing the company into bankruptcy."
"By the year 1670 Britain's imperialist ambitions were well off as she had colonies in Virginia, Massachusetts, Bermuda, Honduras, Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica and Nova Scotia."
"Due to the vast imperialist ambitions of European countries, Britain had several clashes with France."
This competition was evident in the colonization of what is now known as Canada.
"Britain continued to expand by colonizing countries such as New Zealand and Australia, both of which were not empty land as they had their own locals and cultures."
Its growth was reversed by the loss of the American colonies in 1776.
"Britain made compensating gains in India, Australia, and in constructing an informal economic empire through control of trade and finance in Latin America after the independence of Spanish and Portuguese colonies in about 1820."
"By the 1840s, Britain had adopted a highly successful policy of free trade that gave it dominance in the trade of much of the world."
"After losing its first Empire to the Americans, Britain then turned its attention towards Asia, Africa, and the Pacific."
"Following the defeat of Napoleonic France in 1815, Britain enjoyed a century of almost unchallenged dominance and expanded its imperial holdings around the globe."
"Unchallenged at sea, British dominance was later described as Pax Britannica (""British Peace""), a period of relative peace in Europe and the world (1815–1914) during which the British Empire became the global hegemon and adopted the role of global policeman."
"However, this peace was mostly a perceived one from Europe, and the period was still an almost uninterrupted series of colonial wars and disputes."
"The British Conquest of India, its intervention against Mehemet Ali, the Anglo-Burmese Wars, the Crimean War, the Opium Wars and the Scramble for Africa to name the most notable conflicts mobilised ample military means to press Britain's lead in the global conquest Europe led across the century."
"In the early 19th century, the Industrial Revolution began to transform Britain; by the time of the Great Exhibition in 1851 the country was described as the ""workshop of the world""."
"The British Empire expanded to include India, large parts of Africa and many other territories throughout the world."
"Alongside the formal control it exerted over its own colonies, British dominance of much of world trade meant that it effectively controlled the economies of many regions, such as Asia and Latin America."
"Domestically, political attitudes favoured free trade and laissez-faire policies and a gradual widening of the voting franchise."
"During this century, the population increased at a dramatic rate, accompanied by rapid urbanisation, causing significant social and economic stresses."
"To seek new markets and sources of raw materials, the Conservative Party under Disraeli launched a period of imperialist expansion in Egypt, South Africa, and elsewhere."
"Canada, Australia, and New Zealand became self-governing dominions."
A resurgence came in the late 19th century with the Scramble for Africa and major additions in Asia and the Middle East.
"The British spirit of imperialism was expressed by Joseph Chamberlain and Lord Rosebury, and implemented in Africa by Cecil Rhodes."
The pseudo-sciences of Social Darwinism and theories of race formed an ideological underpinning and legitimation during this time.
"Other influential spokesmen included Lord Cromer, Lord Curzon, General Kitchener, Lord Milner, and the writer Rudyard Kipling."
The British Empire was the largest Empire that the world has ever seen both in terms of landmass and population.
"Its power, both military and economic, remained unmatched for a few decades."
"After the First Boer War, the South African Republic and Orange Free State were recognised by Britain but eventually re-annexed after the Second Boer War."
"But British power was fading, as the reunited German state founded by the Kingdom of Prussia posed a growing threat to Britain's dominance."
But Britain gained control of former German and Ottoman colonies with the League of Nations mandate.
Britain now had a practically continuous line of controlled territories from Egypt to Burma and another one from Cairo to Cape Town.
"However, this period was also the one of the emergence of independence movements based on nationalism and new experiences the colonists had gained in the war."
"World War II decisively weakened Britain's position in the world, especially financially."
"Decolonization movements arose nearly everywhere in the Empire, resulting in Indian independence and partition in 1947 and the establishment of independent states in the 1950s."
British imperialism showed its frailty in Egypt during the Suez Crisis in 1956.
"However, with the United States and Soviet Union emerging from World War II as the sole superpowers, Britain's role as a worldwide power declined significantly and rapidly."
"Due to its long history of imperialist expansion, China has been seen by its neighboring countries as a threat due to its large population, giant economy, large military force as well as its territorial evolution throughout history."
"Starting with the unification of China under the Qin dynasty, later Chinese dynasties continued to follow its form of expansions."
"The most successful Chinese imperial dynasties in terms of territorial expansion were the Han, Tang, Yuan, and Qing dynasties."
"At its apex there were colonies on four continents: Europe, North America, Africa and Asia."
"In the 17th century, following territorial losses on the Scandinavian Peninsula, Denmark-Norway began to develop colonies, forts, and trading posts in West Africa, the Caribbean, and the Indian subcontinent."
"Christian IV first initiated the policy of expanding Denmark-Norway's overseas trade, as part of the mercantilist wave that was sweeping Europe."
Denmark-Norway's first colony was established at Tranquebar  on India's southern coast in 1620.
Admiral Ove Gjedde led the expedition that established the colony.
"After 1814, when Norway was ceded to Sweden, Denmark retained what remained of Norway's great medieval colonial holdings."
One by one the smaller colonies were lost or sold.
"Today, the only remaining vestiges are two originally Norwegian colonies that are currently within the Danish Realm, the Faroe Islands and Greenland; the Faroes were a Danish county until 1948, while Greenland's colonial status ceased in 1953."
They are now autonomous territories.
It was followed by French East India Company's trading posts in Africa and Asia in the 17th century.
"France had its ""First colonial empire"" from 1534 until 1814, including New France (Canada, Acadia, Newfoundland and Louisiana), French West Indies (Saint-Domingue, Guadeloupe, Martinique), French Guiana, Senegal (Gorée), Mascarene Islands (Mauritius Island, Réunion) and French India."
"Its ""Second colonial empire"" began with the conquest of Algiers in 1830 and came for the most part to an end with the granting of independence to Algeria in 1962."
"The French imperial history was marked by numerous wars, large and small, and also by significant help to France itself from the colonials in the world wars."
"France took control of Algeria in 1830 but began in earnest to rebuild its worldwide empire after 1850, concentrating chiefly in North and West Africa (French North Africa, French West Africa, French Equatorial Africa), as well as South-East Asia (French Indochina), with other conquests in the South Pacific (New Caledonia, French Polynesia)."
France also twice attempted to make Mexico a colony in 1838–39 and in 1861-67 (see Pastry War and Second French intervention in Mexico).
"French Republicans, at first hostile to empire, only became supportive when Germany started to build her own colonial empire."
"As it developed, the new empire took on roles of trade with France, supplying raw materials and purchasing manufactured items, as well as lending prestige to the motherland and spreading French civilization and language as well as Catholicism."
It also provided crucial manpower in both World Wars.
It became a moral justification to lift the world up to French standards by bringing Christianity and French culture.
"In 1884 the leading exponent of colonialism, Jules Ferry declared France had a civilising mission: ""The higher races have a right over the lower races, they have a duty to civilize the inferior""."
"Full citizenship rights – assimilation – were offered, although in reality assimilation was always on the distant horizon."
"Contrasting from Britain, France sent small numbers of settlers to its colonies, with the only notable exception of Algeria, where French settlers nevertheless always remained a small minority."
"However, after 1945 anti-colonial movements began to challenge the Empire."
France fought and lost a bitter war in Vietnam in the 1950s.
"Whereas they won the war in Algeria, de Gaulle decided to grant Algeria independence anyway in 1962."
French settlers and many local supporters relocated to France.
"Nearly all of France's colonies gained independence by 1960, but France retained great financial and diplomatic influence."
It has repeatedly sent troops to assist its former colonies in Africa in suppressing insurrections and coups d'état.
"They did not establish colonial school systems with the idea of furthering the ambitions of the local people, but rather simply exported the systems and methods in vogue in the mother nation."
Having a moderately trained lower bureaucracy was of great use to colonial officials.
The emerging French-educated indigenous elite saw little value in educating rural peoples.
After 1946 the policy was to bring the best students to Paris for advanced training.
The result was to immerse the next generation of leaders in the growing anti-colonial diaspora centered in Paris.
Impressionistic colonials could mingle with studious scholars or radical revolutionaries or so everything in between.
"The colony was administered by Paul Cambon, who built an educational system for colonists and indigenous people alike that was closely modeled on mainland France."
He emphasized female and vocational education.
The French set up schools based on the scientific method and French culture.
The Pied-Noir (Catholic migrants from Europe) welcomed this.
"Those goals were rejected by the Moslem Arabs, who prized mental agility and their distinctive religious tradition."
They sharply disagreed on goals.
The French educators sought to preserving French culture among the Vietnamese elites and relied on the Mission Culturelle – the heir of the colonial Direction of Education – and its prestigious high schools.
The Americans looked at the great mass of people and sought to make South Vietnam a nation strong enough to stop communism.
"The Americans had far more money, as USAID coordinated and funded the activities of expert teams, and particularly of academic missions."
The French deeply resented the American invasion of their historical zone of cultural imperialism.
The concept of Drang Nach Osten was a core element of German nationalism and a major element of Nazi ideology.
"However, the German involvement in the seizure of overseas territories was negligible until the end of the 19th century."
Prussia unified the other states into the second German Empire in 1871.
"Its Chancellor, Otto von Bismarck (1862–90), long opposed colonial acquisitions, arguing that the burden of obtaining, maintaining, and defending such possessions would outweigh any potential benefits."
In 1883–84 Germany began to build a colonial empire in Africa and the South Pacific.
The Treaty of Versailles made them mandates temporarily operated by the Allied victors.
Germany also lost part of the Eastern territories that became part of independent Poland as a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919.
"Finally, the Eastern territories captured in the Middle Ages were torn from Germany and became part of Poland and the USSR as a result of the territorial reorganization established by the Potsdam conference of the great powers in 1945."
"This was taken over by the Italian government in 1882, becoming modern Italy's first overseas territory."
"Outside Africa, Italy possessed the Dodecanese Islands off the coast of Turkey (following the Italo-Turkish War) and a small concession in Tianjin in China following the Boxer War of 1900."
"During the First World War, Italy occupied southern Albania to prevent it from falling to Austria-Hungary."
"In 1917, it established a protectorate over Albania, which remained in place until 1920."
The Fascist government that came to power with Benito Mussolini in 1922 sought to increase the size of the Italian empire and to satisfy the claims of Italian irredentists.
"In its second invasion of Ethiopia in 1935–36, Italy was successful and it merged its new conquest with its older east African colonies to create Italian East Africa."
"In 1939, Italy invaded Albania and incorporated it into the Fascist state."
It was forced in the peace treaty of 1947 to relinquish sovereignty over all its colonies.
It was granted a trust to administer former Italian Somaliland under United Nations supervision in 1950.
"When Somalia became independent in 1960, Italy's eight-decade experiment with colonialism ended."
"However, in the 1850s, military pressure from the United States and other world powers coerced Japan to open itself to the global market, resulting in an end to the country's isolation."
"A period of conflicts and political revolutions followed due to socioeconomic uncertainty, ending in 1868 with the reunification of political power under the Japanese Emperor during the Meiji Restoration."
This sparked a period of rapid industrialization driven in part by a Japanese desire for self-sufficiency.
In 1869 they took advantage of the defeat of the rebels of the Republic of Ezo to incorporate definitely the island of Hokkaido to Japan.
"For centuries, Japan viewed the Ryukyu Islands as one of its provinces."
"At that time the Ryukyu Islands were claimed by both Qing China and Japan, and the Japanese interpreted the incident as an attack on their citizens."
"They took steps to bring the islands in their jurisdiction: in 1872 the Japanese Ryukyu Domain was declared, and in 1874 a retaliatory incursion to Taiwan was sent, which was a success."
The success of this expedition emboldened the Japanese: not even the Americans could defeat the Taiwanese in the Formosa Expedition of 1867.
"Very few gave it much thought at the time, but this was the first move in the Japanese expansionism series."
"As a result of winning the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Japan took part of Sakhalin Island from Russia."
"Precisely, the victory against the Russian Empire shook the world: never before had an Asian nation defeated a European power, and in Japan it was seen as a feat."
Japan's victory against Russia would act as an antecedent for Asian countries in the fight against the Western powers for Decolonization.
"During World War I, Japan took German-leased territories in China's Shandong Province, as well as the Mariana, Caroline, and Marshall Islands, and kept the islands as League of nations mandates."
"At first, Japan was in good standing with the victorious Allied powers of World War I, but different discrepancies and dissatisfaction with the rewards of the treaties cooled the relations with them, for example American pressure forced it to return the Shandong area."
"Through the decade, it would grow closer to Germany and Italy, forming together the Axis alliance."
"International reactions condemned this move, but Japan's already strong skepticism against Allied nations meant that it nevertheless carried on."
"During the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Japan's military invaded central China."
"Also, in 1938-1939 Japan made an attempt to seize the territory of Soviet Russia and Mongolia, but suffered a serious defeats (see Battle of Lake Khasan, Battles of Khalkhin Gol)."
"By now, relations with the Allied powers were at the bottom, and an international boycott against Japan to deprive it of natural resources was enforced."
"Thus a military move to gain access to them was needed, and so Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, bringing the United States to World War II."
"Using its superior technological advances in naval aviation and its modern doctrines of amphibious and naval warfare, Japan achieved one of the fastest maritime expansions in history."
"Just as Japan's late industrialization success and victory against the Russian Empire was seen as an example among underdeveloped Asia-Pacific nations, the Japanese took advantage of this and promoted among its conquered the goal to jointly create an anti-European ""Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere""."
"This plan helped the Japanese gain support from native populations during its conquests, especially in Indonesia."
"However, the United States had a vastly stronger military and industrial base and defeated Japan, stripping it of conquests and returning its settlers back to Japan."
"In 1453, Mehmed the Conqueror captured Constantinople and made it his capital."
"Its repeated invasions, and brutal treatment of Slavs led to the Great Migrations of the Serbs to escape persecution."
At the beginning of the 17th century the empire contained 32 provinces and numerous vassal states.
"Some of these were later absorbed into the empire, while others were granted various types of autonomy during the course of centuries."
"With Constantinople as its capital and control of lands around the Mediterranean basin, the Ottoman Empire was at the center of interactions between the Eastern and Western worlds for six centuries."
"Following a long period of military setbacks against European powers, the Ottoman Empire gradually declined, losing control of much of its territory in Europe and Africa."
The Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire caused the breakdown of the Ottoman millet concept.
"An understanding of the concept of the nationhood prevalent in the Ottoman Empire, which was different from the current one as it was centered on religion, was a key factor in the decline of the Ottoman Empire."
"The empire allied with Germany in World War I with the imperial ambition of recovering its lost territories, but it dissolved in the aftermath of its decisive defeat."
"The Kemalist national movement, supported by Soviet Russia, achieved victory in the course of the Turkish War of Independence, and the parties signed and ratified the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 and 1924."
The Republic of Turkey was established.
"This took place in a large number of military invasions of the lands east, west, and south of it."
The war resulted in eastern Poland being conquered by Imperial Russia as a colony until 1918.
"The southern campaigns involved a series of Russo-Persian Wars, which began with the Persian Expedition of 1796, resulting in the acquisition of Georgia (country) as a protectorate."
This last conflict led to the ethnic cleansing of Circassians from their lands.
"The Russian conquest of Siberia over the Khanate of Sibir took place in the 16th and 17th centuries, and resulted in the slaughter of various indigenous tribes by Russians, including the Daur, the Koryaks, the Itelmens, Mansi people and the Chukchi."
"The Russian colonization of Central and Eastern Europe and Siberia and treatment of the resident indigenous peoples has been compared to European colonization of the Americas, with similar negative impacts on the indigenous Siberians as upon the indigenous peoples of the Americas."
"The extermination of indigenous Siberian tribes was so complete that a relatively small population of only 180,000 are said to exist today."
"The Russian Empire exploited and suppressed Cossacks hosts during this period, before turning them into the special military estate Sosloviye in the late 18th century."
"The reunification of Ukraine with Russia took place in 1654, when Polish rule brought the population of Ukraine to revolts (see Pereyaslav Council)."
"Given Georgia's history of invasions from the south, an alliance with Russia may have been seen as the only way to discourage or resist Persian and Ottoman aggression, while also establishing a link to Western Europe (see Treaty of Georgievsk)."
Russia's support helped establish independent Mongolia (independent from China) (see Mongolian Revolution of 1911).
"Bolshevik leaders had effectively reestablished a polity with roughly the same extent as that empire by 1921, however with an internationalist ideology: Lenin in particular asserted the right to limited self-determination for national minorities within the new territory."
"After World War II, the Soviet Union installed socialist regimes modeled on those it had installed in 1919–20 in the old Russian Empire, in areas its forces occupied in Eastern Europe."
"The Soviet Union and later the People's Republic of China supported revolutionary and communist movements in foreign nations and colonies to advance their own interests, but were not always successful."
The USSR provided great assistance to Kuomintang in 1926–1928 in the formation of a unified Chinese government (see Northern Expedition).
"Although then relations with the USSR deteriorated, but the USSR was the only world power that provided military assistance to China against Japanese aggression in 1937-1941 (see Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact)."
The victory of the Chinese Communists in the civil war of 1946-1949 relied on the great help of the USSR (see Chinese Civil War).
"Trotsky, and others, believed that the revolution could only succeed in Russia as part of a world revolution."
Lenin wrote extensively on the matter and famously declared that Imperialism was the highest stage of capitalism.
"However, after Lenin's death, Joseph Stalin established 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union, creating the model for subsequent inward looking Stalinist states and purging the early Internationalist elements."
The internationalist tendencies of the early revolution would be abandoned until they returned in the framework of a client state in competition with the Americans during the Cold War.
"Although the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it exhibited traits common to historic empires."
Some scholars hold that the Soviet Union was a hybrid entity containing elements common to both multinational empires and nation states.
Some also argued that the USSR practiced colonialism as did other imperial powers and was carrying on the old Russian tradition of expansion and control.
Mao Zedong once argued that the Soviet Union had itself become an imperialist power while maintaining a socialist façade.
"Moreover, the ideas of imperialism were widely spread in action on the higher levels of government."
Soviet imperialism was roundly condemned In 1979 when the USSR invaded Afghanistan to keep a friendly government in power.
"The invasion ""alerted the Third World, as no earlier Soviet intervention had done, to the nature of Soviet imperialism."
"It must be said that the USSR never called itself an ""Empire"" unlike other world powers and the use of such a name carries a negative connotation."
The United States achieved very significant territorial concessions from Mexico during the Mexican-American War.
"Beginning in the late 19th and early 20th century, policies such as Theodore Roosevelt’s interventionism in Central America and Woodrow Wilson’s mission to ""make the world safe for democracy"" changed all this."
"They were often backed by military force, but were more often affected from behind the scenes."
This is consistent with the general notion of hegemony and imperium of historical empires.
"One year later, a war erupted in the Philippines causing business, labor and government leaders in the US to condemn America's occupation in the Philippines as they also denounced them for causing the deaths of many Filipinos."
He pulled back when Britain's Winston Churchill demanded that victory in the war be the first priority.
"This internal form of imperialism is also distinct from the United States' formation of ""colonies"" abroad."
"Through the treatment of its indigenous peoples during westward expansion, the United States took on the form of an imperial power prior to any attempts at external imperialism."
"This internal form of empire has been referred to as ""internal colonialism""."
"Participation in the African slave trade and the subsequent treatment of its 12 to 15 million Africans is viewed by some to be a more modern extension of America's ""internal colonialism""."
"However, this internal colonialism faced resistance, as external colonialism did, but the anti-colonial presence was far less prominent due to the nearly complete dominance that the United States was able to assert over both indigenous peoples and African-Americans."
"The western world forgets during this process of converting the other that enlightenment and democracy are concepts that not all will agree upon""."
"Following the successes of exploratory maritime voyages conducted during the Age of Discovery, such as those undertaken by Christopher Columbus, Spain committed considerable financial and military resources towards developing a robust navy capable of conducting large-scale, transatlantic expeditionary operations in order to establish and solidify a firm imperial presence across large portions of North America, South America, and the geographic regions comprising the Caribbean basin."
"Concomitant with Spanish endorsement and sponsorship of transatlantic expeditionary voyages was the deployment of Conquistadors, which further expanded Spanish imperial boundaries through the acquisition and development of territories and colonies."
The Caribbean basin functioned as a key geographic focal point for advancing Spanish imperialism.
"Similar to the strategic prioritization Spain placed towards achieving victory in the conquests of the Aztec Empire and Inca Empire, Spain placed equal strategic emphasis on expanding the nation's imperial footprint within the Caribbean basin."
"Echoing the prevailing ideological perspectives regarding colonialism and imperialism embraced by Spain's European rivals during the colonial era, including the English, French, and the Dutch, the Spanish utilized colonialism as a means of expanding imperial geopolitical borders and securing the defense of maritime trade routes in the Caribbean basin."
"While leveraging colonialism in the same geographic operating theater as its imperial rivals, Spain maintained distinct imperial objectives and instituted a unique form of colonialism in support of its imperial agenda."
"Spain placed significant strategic emphasis on the acquisition, extraction, and exportation of precious metals (primarily gold and silver)."
A second objective was the evangelization of subjugated indigenous populations residing in mineral-rich and strategically favorable locations.
"Compulsory labor and slavery were widely institutionalized across Spanish-occupied territories and colonies, with an initial emphasis on directing labor towards mining activity and related methods of procuring semi-precious metals."
A fundamental source of contention stems from the inadvertent conflation of theoretical conceptions of imperialism and colonialism.
"Furthermore, significant variation exists in the definition and interpretation of these terms as expounded by historians, anthropologists, philosophers, and political scientists."
"Among historians, there is substantial support in favor of approaching imperialism as a conceptual theory emerging during the 18th–19th centuries, particularly within Britain, propagated by key exponents such as Joseph Chamberlain and Benjamin Disraeli."
"In accordance with this theoretical perspective, the activities of the Spanish in the Caribbean are not components of a preeminent, ideologically-driven form of imperialism."
"Rather, these activities are more accurately classified as representing a form of colonialism."
Further divergence among historians can be attributed to varying theoretical perspectives regarding imperialism that are proposed by emerging academic schools of thought.
Cultural imperialism signifies the dimensions of the process that go beyond economic exploitation or military force.
"Colonialism is a practice or policy of control by one people or power over other people or areas, often by establishing colonies and generally with the aim of economic dominance."
"In the process of colonisation, colonisers may impose their religion, language, economics, and other cultural practices on indigenous peoples."
"The foreign administrators rule the territory in pursuit of their interests, seeking to benefit from the colonised region's people and resources."
"At first, European colonising countries followed policies of mercantilism, aiming to strengthen the home-country economy, so agreements usually restricted the colony to trading only with the metropole (mother country)."
"By the mid-19th century, however, the British Empire gave up mercantilism and trade restrictions and adopted the principle of free trade, with few restrictions or tariffs."
Christian missionaries were active in practically all of the European-controlled colonies because the metropoles were Christian.
"Postcolonialism and neocolonialism has continued or shifted relations and ideologies of colonialism, justifying its continuation with concepts such as development and new frontiers, as in exploring outer space for colonization."
"Webster's Encyclopedic Dictionary defines colonialism as ""the system or policy of a nation seeking to extend or retain its authority over other people or territories""."
"The Merriam-Webster Dictionary offers four definitions, including ""something characteristic of a colony"" and ""control by one power over a dependent area or people""."
"Etymologically, the word ""colony"" comes from the Latin colōnia—""a place for agriculture""."
"The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy uses the term ""to describe the process of European settlement and political control over the rest of the world, including the Americas, Australia, and parts of Africa and Asia""."
"It discusses the distinction between colonialism, imperialism and conquest and states that ""[t]he difficulty of defining colonialism stems from the fact that the term is often used as a synonym for imperialism."
The fundamental decisions affecting the lives of the colonised people are made and implemented by the colonial rulers in pursuit of interests that are often defined in a distant metropolis.
"Rejecting cultural compromises with the colonised population, the colonisers are convinced of their own superiority and their ordained mandate to rule."
"Settler colonialism involves large-scale immigration, often motivated by religious, political, or economic reasons."
It aims largely to replace any existing population.
"Here, a large number of people emigrate to the colony for the purpose of staying and cultivating the land."
"Australia, Canada, Turkey and the United States, all exemplify settler-colonial societies."
"Exploitation colonialism involves fewer colonists and focuses on the exploitation of natural resources or population as labour, typically to the benefit of the metropole."
This category includes trading posts as well as larger colonies where colonists would constitute much of the political and economic administration.
"Prior to the end of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and widespread abolition, when indigenous labour was unavailable, slaves were often imported to the Americas, first by the Portuguese, and later by the Spanish, Dutch, French and British."
"Surrogate colonialism involves a settlement project supported by a colonial power, in which most of the settlers do not come from a same ethnic group as the ruling power."
Internal colonialism is a notion of uneven structural power between areas of a state.
The source of exploitation comes from within the state.
This is demonstrated in the way control and exploitation may pass from people from the colonising country to an immigrant population within a newly independent country.
"National colonialism is a process involving elements of both settler and internal colonialism, in which nation-building and colonization are symbiotically connected, with the colonial regime seeking to remake the colonized peoples into their own cultural and political image."
"The goal is to integrate them into the state, but only as reflections of the state's preferred culture."
The Republic of China in Taiwan is the archetypal example of a national-colonialist society.
"Colonialism gave rise to culturally and ethnically mixed populations such as the mestizos of the Americas, as well as racially divided populations such as those found in French Algeria or in Southern Rhodesia."
"In fact, everywhere where colonial powers established a consistent and continued presence, hybrid communities existed."
"Notable examples in Asia include the Anglo-Burmese, Anglo-Indian, Burgher, Eurasian Singaporean, Filipino mestizo, Kristang and Macanese peoples."
"In the Dutch East Indies (later Indonesia) the vast majority of ""Dutch"" settlers were in fact Eurasians known as Indo-Europeans, formally belonging to the European legal class in the colony (see also Indos in pre-colonial history and Indos in colonial history)."
"Phoenicians, Greeks and  Romans founded colonies in antiquity."
Phoenicia had an enterprising maritime trading-culture that spread across the Mediterranean from 1550 BC to 300 BC; later the Persian empire and various Greek city-states continued on this line of setting up colonies.
"The  Romans would soon follow, setting up  coloniae throughout the Mediterranean, in Northern Africa, and in Western Asia."
"Beginning in the 7th century, Arabs colonized a substantial portion of the Middle East, Northern Africa, and parts of Asia and Europe."
"From the 9th century  Vikings (Norsemen) established  colonies in Britain, Ireland, Iceland, Greenland, North America, present-day Russia and Ukraine, France (Normandy) and Sicily."
"In the 9th century a new wave of Mediterranean colonisation began, with competitors such as the  Venetians,  Genovese and  Amalfians infiltrating the wealthy previously Byzantine or Eastern Roman islands and lands."
"European Crusaders set up colonial regimes in Outremer (in the Levant, 1097-1291) and in the  Baltic littoral (12th century onwards)."
"Venice began to dominate Dalmatia and reached its greatest nominal colonial extent at the conclusion of the Fourth Crusade in 1204, with the declaration of the  acquisition of three octaves of the Byzantine Empire."
Spain (initially the Crown of Castile) and soon after Portugal encountered the Americas (1492 onwards) through sea travel and built trading posts or conquered large extents of land.
"For some people, it is this building of colonies across oceans that differentiates colonialism from other types of expansionism."
"Madrid and Lisbon  divided the areas of these ""new"" lands between the Spanish Empire and the Portuguese Empire in 1494; other would-be colonial powers paid little heed to the theoretical demarcation."
"The 17th century saw the birth of the French colonial empire and the Dutch Empire, as well as the English overseas possessions, which later became the British Empire."
"However, empire-builders established several new colonies after this time, including in the German colonial empire and the Belgian colonial empire."
"Rather, these empires expanded through the more traditional route of the conquest of neighbouring territories."
"There was, though, some Russian colonisation of the Americas across the Bering Strait."
"From the 1860s, the Empire of Japan modelled itself on European colonial empires and expanded its territories in the Pacific and on the Asian mainland."
Argentina and the Empire of Brazil fought for hegemony in South America.
"The United States of America gained overseas territories after the 1898 Spanish–American War - hence the coining of the term  ""American Empire""."
"Nazi Germany set up short-lived colonial systems (Reichskommissariate,  Generalgouvernement) in Eastern Europe in the early 1940s."
"These included significant wars of independence fought in  Indonesia,  Vietnam,  Algeria, and  Kenya."
"Eventually, the European powers—pressured by the United States and Soviets—resigned themselves to decolonisation."
"In 1962 the United Nations set up a Special Committee on Decolonisation, often called the Committee of 24, to encourage this process."
"Outside Europe, few areas had remained without coming under formal colonial tutorship - and even Siam,  China, Nepal, Japan, Afghanistan, Persia and  Abyssinia had felt varying degrees of Western colonial-style influence -  concessions,  unequal treaties, extraterritoriality and the like."
"He reports that in every case the support cost, especially the military system necessary to support and defend colonies, outran the total trade they produced."
"Apart from the British Empire, they did not provide favoured destinations for the immigration of surplus metropole populations."
"The question of whether colonies paid is, however, a complicated one when recognizing the multiplicity of interests involved."
In some cases colonial powers paid a lot in military costs while private investors pocketed the benefits.
In other cases the colonial powers managed to move the burden of administrative costs to the colonies themselves by imposing taxes.
Generally it does not refer to a type of direct colonisation - rather to colonialism or colonial-style exploitation by other means.
"Various effects, both immediate and protracted, include the spread of virulent diseases, unequal social relations, detribalization, exploitation, enslavement, medical advances, the creation of new institutions, abolitionism, improved infrastructure, and technological progress."
"Colonial practices also spur the spread of colonist languages, literature and cultural institutions, while endangering or obliterating those of native peoples."
The native cultures of the colonised peoples can also have a powerful influence on the imperial country.
Greek trade networks spread throughout the Mediterranean region while Roman trade expanded with the primary goal of directing tribute from the colonised areas towards the Roman metropole.
"According to Strabo, by the time of emperor Augustus, up to 120 Roman ships would set sail every year from Myos Hormos in Roman Egypt to India."
"Aztec civilisation developed into an extensive empire that, much like the Roman Empire, had the goal of exacting tribute from the conquered colonial areas."
"Despite the general trend of economic expansion, the economic performance of former European colonies varies significantly."
"At the same time, these institutions are also consequences of political institutions – especially how de facto and de jure political power is allocated."
"To explain the different colonial cases, we thus need to look first into the political institutions that shaped the economic institutions."
"For example, one interesting observation is ""the Reversal of Fortune"" – the less developed civilisations in 1500, like North America, Australia, and New Zealand, are now much richer than those countries who used to be in the prosperous civilisations in 1500 before the colonists came, like the Mughals in India and the Incas in the Americas."
One explanation offered by the paper focuses on the political institutions of the various colonies: it was less likely for European colonists to introduce economic institutions where they could benefit quickly from the extraction of resources in the area.
"Therefore, given a more developed civilisation and denser population, European colonists would rather keep the existing economic systems than introduce an entirely new system; while in places with little to extract, European colonists would rather establish new economic institutions to protect their interests."
"In many pre-colonialist areas, women maintained power, prestige, or authority through reproductive or agricultural control."
"For example, in certain parts of sub-Saharan Africa women maintained farmland in which they had usage rights."
"While men would make political and communal decisions for a community, the women would control the village's food supply or their individual family's land."
"However, when working to improve productivity, Europeans focused mostly on male workers."
"Foreign aid arrived in the form of loans, land, credit, and tools to speed up development, but were only allocated to men."
"In a more European fashion, women were expected to serve on a more domestic level."
Exploitation of non-Europeans and of other Europeans to support imperial goals was acceptable to the colonisers.
Two outgrowths of this imperial agenda were the extension of slavery and indentured servitude.
"Spain and Portugal had brought African slaves to work in African colonies such as Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, and then in Latin America, by the 16th century."
"The British, French and Dutch joined in the slave trade in subsequent centuries."
The European colonial system took approximately 11 million Africans to the Caribbean and to North and South America as slaves.
"Abolitionists in Europe and Americas protested the inhumane treatment of African slaves, which led to the elimination of the slave trade (and later, of most forms of slavery) by the late 19th century."
"One (disputed) school of thought points to the role of abolitionism in the American Revolution: while the British colonial metropole started to move towards outlawing slavery, slave-owning elites in the Thirteen Colonies saw this as one of the reasons to fight for their post-colonial independence and for the right to develop and continue a largely slave-based economy."
British colonising activity in New Zealand from the early 19th century played a part in ending slave-taking and slave-keeping among the indigenous Māori.
Indentured servants consented to a contract with the European colonisers.
"Under their contract, the servant would work for an employer for a term of at least a year, while the employer agreed to pay for the servant's voyage to the colony, possibly pay for the return to the country of origin, and pay the employee a wage as well."
"The employees became ""indentured"" to the employer because they owed a debt back to the employer for their travel expense to the colony, which they were expected to pay through their wages."
"In practice, indentured servants were exploited through terrible working conditions and burdensome debts imposed by the employers, with whom the servants had no means of negotiating the debt once they arrived in the colony."
India and China were the largest source of indentured servants during the colonial era.
"Indentured servants from India travelled to British colonies in Asia, Africa and the Caribbean, and also to French and Portuguese colonies, while Chinese servants travelled to British and Dutch colonies."
"Between 1830 and 1930, around 30 million indentured servants migrated from India, and 24 million returned to India."
"By the end of the colonial period they were mostly successful in this aim, though slavery persists in Africa and in the world at large with much the same practices of de facto servility despite legislative prohibition."
"Greeks developed the phalanx system, which enabled their military units to present themselves to their enemies as a wall, with foot soldiers using shields to cover one another during their advance on the battlefield."
"Under Philip II of Macedon, they were able to organise thousands of soldiers into a formidable battle force, bringing together carefully trained infantry and cavalry regiments."
Alexander the Great exploited this military foundation further during his conquests.
"The Spanish Empire held a major advantage over Mesoamerican warriors through the use of weapons made of stronger metal, predominantly iron, which was able to shatter the blades of axes used by the Aztec civilisation and others."
The use of gunpowder weapons cemented the European military advantage over the peoples they sought to subjugate in the Americas and elsewhere.
"Francophone residents of Quebec, for example, were vocal in opposing conscription into the armed services to fight on behalf of Britain during World War I, resulting in the Conscription crisis of 1917."
Other European colonies had much more pronounced conflict between European settlers and the local population.
"Rebellions broke out in the later decades of the imperial era, such as India's Sepoy Rebellion of 1857."
"The territorial boundaries imposed by European colonisers, notably in central Africa and South Asia, defied the existing boundaries of native populations that had previously interacted little with one another."
"European colonisers disregarded native political and cultural animosities, imposing peace upon people under their military control."
Native populations were often relocated at the will of the colonial administrators.
These events also caused much bloodshed at the time of the migration of immigrants from the two countries.
Muslims from India and Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan migrated to the respective countries they sought independence to.
"In some cases, this was a movement of settlers of European origin returning to the land of their birth, or to an ancestral birthplace."
"900,000 French colonists (known as the Pied-Noirs) resettled in France following Algeria's independence in 1962."
A significant number of these migrants were also of Algerian descent.
Citizens of the former colonies of European countries may have a privileged status in some respects with regard to immigration rights when settling in the former European imperial nation.
"For example, rights to dual citizenship may be generous, or larger immigrant quotas may be extended to former colonies."
"In some cases, the former European imperial nations continue to foster close political and economic ties with former colonies."
"The Commonwealth of Nations is an organisation that promotes cooperation between and among Britain and its former colonies, the Commonwealth members."
"A similar organisation exists for former colonies of France, the Francophonie; the Community of Portuguese Language Countries plays a similar role for former Portuguese colonies, and the Dutch Language Union is the equivalent for former colonies of the Netherlands."
"Migration from former colonies has proven to be problematic for European countries, where the majority population may express hostility to ethnic minorities who have immigrated from former colonies."
"Cultural and religious conflict have often erupted in France in recent decades, between immigrants from the Maghreb countries of north Africa and the majority population of France."
"Nonetheless, immigration has changed the ethnic composition of France; by the 1980s, 25% of the total population of ""inner Paris"" and 14% of the metropolitan region were of foreign origin, mainly Algerian."
"Smallpox also ravaged Mexico in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in Tenochtitlan alone, including the emperor, and Peru in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors."
Measles killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 17th century.
"In 1618–1619, smallpox wiped out 90% of the Massachusetts Bay Native Americans."
Some believe that the death of up to 95% of the Native American population of the New World was caused by Old World diseases.
"Introduced diseases, notably smallpox, nearly wiped out the native population of Easter Island."
"The findings suggested Europeans could have carried the nonvenereal tropical bacteria home, where the organisms may have mutated into a more deadly form in the different conditions of Europe."
The disease was more frequently fatal than it is today; syphilis was a major killer in Europe during the Renaissance.
"The first cholera pandemic began in Bengal, then spread across India by 1820."
Ten thousand British troops and countless Indians died during this pandemic.
"Waldemar Haffkine, who mainly worked in India, who developed and used vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague in the 1890s, is considered the first microbiologist."
"By 1832, the federal government of the United States established a smallpox vaccination program for Native Americans."
Under the direction of Mountstuart Elphinstone a program was launched to propagate smallpox vaccination in India.
The sleeping sickness epidemic in Africa was arrested due to mobile teams systematically screening millions of people at risk.
"Notable examples of these plants included sugar, nutmeg, tobacco, cloves, cinnamon, Peruvian bark, peppers and tea."
"This work was a large part of securing financing for colonial ambitions, supporting European expansion and ensuring the profitability of such endeavors."
"Vasco de Gama and Christopher Columbus were seeking to establish routes to trade spices, dyes and silk from the Moluccas, India and China by sea that would be independent of the established routes controlled by Venetian and Middle Eastern merchants."
"Naturalists like Hendrik van Rheede, Georg Eberhard Rumphius, and Jacobus Bontius compiled data about eastern plants on behalf of the Europeans."
"Though Sweden did not possess an extensive colonial network, botanical research based on Carl Linnaeus identified and developed techniques to grow cinnamon, tea and rice locally as an alternative to costly imports."
"From the time of Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome, this fact has been addressed by empires adopting the concept of universalism, and applying it to their imperial policies towards their subjects far from the imperial capitol."
"The capitol, the metropole, was the source of ostensibly enlightened policies imposed throughout the distant colonies."
"The empire that grew from Greek conquest, particularly by Alexander the Great, spurred the spread of Greek language, religion, science and philosophy throughout the colonies."
"While most Greeks considered their own culture superior to all others (the word barbarian is derived from mutterings that sounded to Greek ears like ""bar-bar""), Alexander was unique in promoting a campaign to win the hearts and minds of the Persians."
He adopted Persian customs of clothing and otherwise encouraged his men to go native by adopting local wives and learning their mannerisms.
"Of note is that he radically departed from earlier Greek attempts at colonisation, characterised by the murder and enslavement of the local inhabitants and the settling of Greek citizens from the polis."
Roman universalism was characterised by cultural and religious tolerance and a focus on civil efficiency and the rule of law.
Roman law was imposed on both Roman citizens and colonial subjects.
"Although Imperial Rome had no public education, Latin spread through its use in government and trade."
"Roman law prohibited local leaders to wage war between themselves, which was responsible for the 200 year long Pax Romana, at the time the longest period of peace in history."
"The Roman Empire was tolerant of diverse cultures and religious practises, even allowing them on a few occasions to threaten Roman authority."
"While the extent in which geography as an academic study is implicated in colonialism is contentious, geographical tools such as cartography, shipbuilding, navigation, mining and agricultural productivity were instrumental in European colonial expansion."
"Historical geographical theories such as environmental determinism legitimised colonialism by positing the view that some parts of the world were underdeveloped, which created notions of skewed evolution."
"Geographers are primarily focused on the spaces of colonialism and imperialism; more specifically, the material and symbolic appropriation of space enabling colonialism."
"Maps played an extensive role in colonialism, as Bassett would put it ""by providing geographical information in a convenient and standardised format, cartographers helped open West Africa to European conquest, commerce, and colonisation""."
"However, because the relationship between colonialism and geography was not scientifically objective, cartography was often manipulated during the colonial era."
Social norms and values had an effect on the constructing of maps.
During colonialism map-makers used rhetoric in their formation of boundaries and in their art.
The rhetoric favoured the view of the conquering Europeans; this is evident in the fact that any map created by a non-European was instantly regarded as inaccurate.
"Furthermore, European cartographers were required to follow a set of rules which led to ethnocentrism; portraying one's own ethnicity in the centre of the map."
"""A common practice by the European cartographers of the time was to map unexplored areas as ""blank spaces""."
This influenced the colonial powers as it sparked competition amongst them to explore and colonise these regions.
Imperialists aggressively and passionately looked forward to filling these spaces for the glory of their respective countries.
"The Dictionary of Human Geography notes that cartography was used to empty 'undiscovered' lands of their Indigenous meaning and bring them into spatial existence via the imposition of ""Western place-names and borders, [therefore] priming 'virgin' (putatively empty land, 'wilderness') for colonisation (thus sexualising colonial landscapes as domains of male penetration), reconfiguring alien space as absolute, quantifiable and separable (as property)."
"""David Livingstone stresses ""that geography has meant different things at different times and in different places"" and that we should keep an open mind in regards to the relationship between geography and colonialism instead of identifying boundaries."
"Geography as a discipline was not and is not an objective science, Painter and Jeffrey argue, rather it is based on assumptions about the physical world."
"Comparison of exogeographical representations of ostensibly tropical environments in science fiction art support this conjecture, finding the notion of the tropics to be an artificial collection of ideas and beliefs that are independent of geography."
"Colonialism is based on an imperial outlook, thereby creating a consequential relationship."
"Through an empire, colonialism is established and capitalism is expanded, on the other hand a capitalist economy naturally enforces an empire."
In the next section Marxists make a case for this mutually reinforcing relationship.
"Marx thought that working within the global capitalist system, colonialism is closely associated with uneven development."
"It is an ""instrument of wholesale destruction, dependency and systematic exploitation producing distorted economies, socio-psychological disorientation, massive poverty and neocolonial dependency""."
Colonies are constructed into modes of production.
The search for raw materials and the current search for new investment opportunities is a result of inter-capitalist rivalry for capital accumulation.
"Specifically, this demand for political democracy implies complete freedom to agitate for secession and for a referendum on secession by the seceding nation."""
"Non Russian marxists within the RSFSR and later the USSR, like Sultan Galiev and Vasyl Shakhrai, meanwhile, between 1918 and 1923 and then after 1929, considered the Soviet Regime a renewed version of the Russian imperialism and colonialism."
"Power is the ultimate determinant in human society, being basic to the relations within any group and between groups."
That little control over internal matters disappeared under colonialism.
Colonialism went much further than trade.
It meant a tendency towards direct appropriation by Europeans of the social institutions within Africa.
"Africans ceased to set indigenous cultural goals and standards, and lost full command of training young members of the society."
"From an African view-point, that amounted to consistent expatriation of surplus produced by African labour out of African resources."
It meant the development of Europe as part of the same dialectical process in which Africa was underdeveloped.
"""Colonial Africa fell within that part of the international capitalist economy from which surplus was drawn to feed the metropolitan sector."
"As seen earlier, exploitation of land and labour is essential for human social advance, but only on the assumption that the product is made available within the area where the exploitation takes place."
"""According to Lenin, the new imperialism emphasised the transition of capitalism from free trade to a stage of monopoly capitalism to finance capital."
"He states it is, ""connected with the intensification of the struggle for the partition of the world""."
"As free trade thrives on exports of commodities, monopoly capitalism thrived on the export of capital amassed by profits from banks and industry."
"This, to Lenin, was the highest stage of capitalism."
He goes on to state that this form of capitalism was doomed for war between the capitalists and the exploited nations with the former inevitably losing.
War is stated to be the consequence of imperialism.
"Uzoigwe states, ""But it is now clear from more serious investigations of African history in this period that imperialism was essentially economic in its fundamental impulses."""
"Their philosophies found the colonial enterprise, particularly mercantilism, in opposition to the principles of free trade and liberal policies."
"Adam Smith wrote in The Wealth of Nations that Britain should grant independence to all of its colonies and also argued that it would be economically beneficial for British people in the average, although the merchants having mercantilist privileges would lose out."
"Colonialism also acted to reinforce these same racial belief systems within the ""mother-countries"" themselves."
"Biologists, naturalists, anthropologists, and ethnologists of the 19th century were focused on the study of colonised indigenous women, as in the case of Georges Cuvier's study of Sarah Baartman."
Such cases embraced a natural superiority and inferiority relationship between the races based on the observations of naturalists' from the mother-countries.
"Female inferiority across all cultures was emerging as an idea supposedly supported by craniology that led scientists to argue that the typical brain size of the female human was, on the average, slightly smaller than that of the male, thus inferring that therefore female humans must be less developed and less evolutionarily advanced than males."
"Such seemingly flawed studies of race and gender coincided with the era of colonialism and the initial introduction of foreign cultures, appearances, and gender roles into the now gradually widening world-views of the scholars of the mother-countries."
"Othering is the creation of those who discriminate, to distinguish, label, categorise those who do not fit in the societal norm."
"Several scholars in recent decades developed the notion of the ""other"" as an epistemological concept in social theory."
"""othered"" places they wanted to dominate to legalise their exploitation of the land."
"During and after the rise of colonialism the Western powers perceived the East as the ""other"", being different and separate from their societal norm."
"This viewpoint and separation of culture had divided the Eastern and Western culture creating a dominant/subordinate dynamic, both being the ""other"" towards themselves."
"In this sense, one can regard post-colonial literature as a branch of postmodern literature concerned with the political and cultural independence of peoples formerly subjugated in colonial empires."
"Saïd analyzed the works of Balzac, Baudelaire and Lautréamont, arguing that they helped to shape a societal fantasy of European racial superiority."
"Writers of post-colonial fiction interact with the traditional colonial discourse, but modify or subvert it; for instance by retelling a familiar story from the perspective of an oppressed minor character in the story."
"In explaining his position, he says ""I admit that it is a good thing to place different civilisations in contact with each other that it is an excellent thing to blend different worlds; that whatever its own particular genius may be, a civilisation that withdraws into itself atrophies; that for civilisations, exchange is oxygen."""
"However, he contends that colonisation is a harmful and counterproductive means of interacting with and learning from neighbouring civilisations."
"To illustrate his point, he explains that colonisation relies on racist and xenophobic frameworks that dehumanise the targets of colonisation and justify their extreme and brutal mistreatment."
"Every time an immoral act perpetrated by colonisers onto the colonised is justified by racist, sexist, otherwise xenophobic, or capitalist motivations to subjugate a group of people, the colonising civilisation ""acquires another dead weight, a universal regression takes place, a gangrene sets in, a centre of infection begins to spread."""

Archaeology (or archeology) is the study of human activity through the recovery and analysis of material culture.
"Archaeology is often considered a branch of socio-cultural anthropology, but archaeologists also draw from biological, geological, and environmental systems through their study of the past."
"The archaeological record consists of artifacts, architecture, biofacts or ecofacts and cultural landscapes."
Archaeology can be considered both a social science and a branch of the humanities.
"Archaeology is distinct from palaeontology, which is the study of fossil remains."
"It is particularly important for learning about prehistoric societies, for whom there may be no written records to study."
"Prehistory includes over 99% of the human past, from the Paleolithic until the advent of literacy in societies across the world."
"Archaeology has various goals, which range from understanding culture history to reconstructing past lifeways to documenting and explaining changes in human societies through time."
"In broad scope, archaeology relies on cross-disciplinary research."
"Archaeology developed out of antiquarianism in Europe during the 19th century, and has since become a discipline practiced across the world."
Archaeology has been used by nation-states to create particular visions of the past.
"Since its early development, various specific sub-disciplines of archaeology have developed, including maritime archaeology, feminist archaeology and archaeoastronomy, and numerous different scientific techniques have been developed to aid archaeological investigation."
"Nonetheless, today, archaeologists face many problems, such as dealing with pseudoarchaeology, the looting of artifacts, a lack of public interest, and opposition to the excavation of human remains."
"Not only did he lead the first excavations which were to find the foundation deposits of the temples of Šamaš the sun god, the warrior goddess Anunitu (both located in Sippar), and the sanctuary that Naram-Sin built to the moon god, located in Harran, but he also had them restored to their former glory."
He was also the first to date an archaeological artifact in his attempt to date Naram-Sin's temple during his search for it.
"Even though his estimate was inaccurate by about 1,500 years, it was still a very good one considering the lack of accurate dating technology at the time."
"Antiquarians studied history with particular attention to ancient artifacts and manuscripts, as well as historical sites."
"Antiquarianism focused on the empirical evidence that existed for the understanding of the past, encapsulated in the motto of the 18th-century antiquary, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, ""We speak from facts not theory""."
"In his book published in 1088, Shen Kuo criticized contemporary Chinese scholars for attributing ancient bronze vessels as creations of famous sages rather than artisan commoners, and for attempting to revive them for ritual use without discerning their original functionality and purpose of manufacture."
"Flavio Biondo, an Italian Renaissance humanist historian, created a systematic guide to the ruins and topography of ancient Rome in the early 15th century, for which he has been called an early founder of archaeology."
"Antiquarians of the 16th century, including John Leland and William Camden, conducted surveys of the English countryside, drawing, describing and interpreting the monuments that they encountered."
"""Archaeology"", from 1607 onwards, initially meant what we would call ""ancient history"" generally, with the narrower modern sense first seen in 1837."
He was also ahead of his time in the analysis of his findings.
"The discovery of entire towns, complete with utensils and even human shapes, as well the unearthing of frescos, had a big impact throughout Europe."
"However, prior to the development of modern techniques, excavations tended to be haphazard; the importance of concepts such as stratification and context were overlooked."
"The idea of overlapping strata tracing back to successive periods was borrowed from the new geological and paleontological work of scholars like William Smith, James Hutton and Charles Lyell."
The application of stratigraphy to archaeology first took place with the excavations of prehistorical and Bronze Age sites.
"In the third and fourth decades of the 19th-century, archaeologists like Jacques Boucher de Perthes and Christian Jürgensen Thomsen began to put the artifacts they had found in chronological order."
"A major figure in the development of archaeology into a rigorous science was the army officer and ethnologist, Augustus Pitt Rivers, who began excavations on his land in England in the 1880s."
"His approach was highly methodical by the standards of the time, and he is widely regarded as the first scientific archaeologist."
"He arranged his artifacts by type or ""typologically, and within types by date or ""chronologically""."
"This style of arrangement, designed to highlight the evolutionary trends in human artifacts, was of enormous significance for the accurate dating of the objects."
"His painstaking recording and study of artifacts, both in Egypt and later in Palestine, laid down many of the ideas behind modern archaeological recording; he remarked that ""I believe the true line of research lies in the noting and comparison of the smallest details."""
"Petrie developed the system of dating layers based on pottery and ceramic findings, which revolutionized the chronological basis of Egyptology."
Petrie was the first to scientifically investigate the Great Pyramid in Egypt during the 1880s.
"He was also responsible for mentoring and training a whole generation of Egyptologists, including Howard Carter who went on to achieve fame with the discovery of the tomb of 14th-century BC pharaoh Tutankhamun."
"The first stratigraphic excavation to reach wide popularity with public was that of Hissarlik, on the site of ancient Troy, carried out by Heinrich Schliemann, Frank Calvert and Wilhelm Dörpfeld in the 1870s."
"These scholars individuated nine different cities that had overlapped with one another, from prehistory to the Hellenistic period."
"Wheeler developed the grid system of excavation, which was further improved by his student Kathleen Kenyon."
"Archaeology became a professional activity in the first half of the 20th century, and it became possible to study archaeology as a subject in universities and even schools."
"By the end of the 20th century nearly all professional archaeologists, at least in developed countries, were graduates."
"Further adaptation and innovation in archaeology continued in this period, when maritime archaeology and urban archaeology became more prevalent and rescue archaeology was developed as a result of increasing commercial development."
"Over 99% of the development of humanity has occurred within prehistoric cultures, who did not make use of writing, thereby no written records exist for study purposes."
"Without such written sources, the only way to understand prehistoric societies is through archaeology."
"Many important developments in human history occurred during prehistory, such as the evolution of humanity during the Paleolithic period, when the hominins developed from the australopithecines in Africa and eventually into modern Homo sapiens."
"Archaeology also sheds light on many of humanity's technological advances, for instance the ability to use fire, the development of stone tools, the discovery of metallurgy, the beginnings of religion and the creation of agriculture."
"For many literate cultures, such as Ancient Greece and Mesopotamia, their surviving records are often incomplete and biased to some extent."
"In many societies, literacy was restricted to the elite classes, such as the clergy or the bureaucracy of court or temple."
The literacy even of aristocrats has sometimes been restricted to deeds and contracts.
The interests and world-view of elites are often quite different from the lives and interests of the populace.
Writings that were produced by people more representative of the general population were unlikely to find their way into libraries and be preserved there for posterity.
"Thus, written records tend to reflect the biases, assumptions, cultural values and possibly deceptions of a limited range of individuals, usually a small fraction of the larger population."
"Hence, written records cannot be trusted as a sole source."
Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of people have come and gone of which there is little or no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete.
"Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations."
"These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently."
Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded.
"Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology."
"In addition to their scientific importance, archaeological remains sometimes have political or cultural significance to descendants of the people who produced them, monetary value to collectors, or simply strong aesthetic appeal."
"Many people identify archaeology with the recovery of such aesthetic, religious, political, or economic treasures rather than with the reconstruction of past societies."
"This view is often espoused in works of popular fiction, such as Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Mummy, and King Solomon's Mines."
"When such unrealistic subjects are treated more seriously, accusations of pseudoscience are invariably levelled at their proponents (see Pseudoarchaeology)."
"However, these endeavours, real and fictional, are not representative of modern archaeology."
"When archaeology developed in the late 19th century, the first approach to archaeological theory to be practiced was that of cultural-history archaeology, which held the goal of explaining why cultures changed and adapted rather than just highlighting the fact that they did, therefore emphasizing historical particularism."
"In the early 20th century, many archaeologists who studied past societies with direct continuing links to existing ones (such as those of Native Americans, Siberians, Mesoamericans etc.)"
"followed the direct historical approach, compared the continuity between the past and contemporary ethnic and cultural groups."
"In the 1960s, an archaeological movement largely led by American archaeologists like Lewis Binford and Kent Flannery arose that rebelled against the established cultural-history archaeology."
"It questioned processualism's appeals to scientific positivism and impartiality, and emphasized the importance of a more self-critical theoretical reflexivity."
"However, this approach has been criticized by processualists as lacking scientific rigor, and the validity of both processualism and post-processualism is still under debate."
"Before any practical work can begin, however, a clear objective as to what the archaeologists are looking to achieve must be agreed upon."
"This done, a site is surveyed to find out as much as possible about it and the surrounding area."
"Second, an excavation may take place to uncover any archaeological features buried under the ground."
"And, third, the information collected during the excavation is studied and evaluated in an attempt to achieve the original research objectives of the archaeologists."
"It is then considered good practice for the information to be published so that it is available to other archaeologists and historians, although this is sometimes neglected."
There are two types of remote sensing instruments—passive and active.
Passive instruments detect natural energy that is reflected or emitted from the observed scene.
Passive instruments sense only radiation emitted by the object being viewed or reflected by the object from a source other than the instrument.
Active instruments emit energy and record what is reflected.
Satellite imagery is an example of passive remote sensing.
Distance to the object is determined by recording the time between the transmitted and backscattered pulses and using the speed of light to calculate the distance travelled.
"Lidars can determine atmospheric profiles of aerosols, clouds, and other constituents of the atmosphere."
"By independently knowing the height of the platform with respect to the mean Earth's surface, the topography of the underlying surface can be determined."
Regional survey is the attempt to systematically locate previously unknown sites in a region.
"Site survey is the attempt to systematically locate features of interest, such as houses and middens, within a site."
Each of these two goals may be accomplished with largely the same methods.
Survey was not widely practiced in the early days of archaeology.
"Cultural historians and prior researchers were usually content with discovering the locations of monumental sites from the local populace, and excavating only the plainly visible features there."
"It requires relatively little time and expense, because it does not require processing large volumes of soil to search out artifacts."
"(Nevertheless, surveying a large region or site can be expensive, so archaeologists often employ sampling methods.)"
"As with other forms of non-destructive archaeology, survey avoids ethical issues (of particular concern to descendant peoples) associated with destroying a site through excavation."
"It is the only way to gather some forms of information, such as settlement patterns and settlement structure."
"Survey data are commonly assembled into maps, which may show surface features and/or artifact distribution."
The simplest survey technique is surface survey.
"It involves combing an area, usually on foot but sometimes with the use of mechanized transport, to search for features or artifacts visible on the surface."
"Surface survey cannot detect sites or features that are completely buried under earth, or overgrown with vegetation."
"Surface survey may also include mini-excavation techniques such as augers, corers, and shovel test pits."
"If no materials are found, the area surveyed is deemed sterile."
"Aerial survey is conducted using cameras attached to airplanes, balloons, UAVs, or even Kites."
A bird's-eye view is useful for quick mapping of large or complex sites.
Aerial photographs are used to document the status of the archaeological dig.
Aerial imaging can also detect many things not visible from the surface.
"Plants growing above a buried man made structure, such as a stone wall, will develop more slowly, while those above other types of features (such as middens) may develop more rapidly."
"Photographs of ripening grain, which changes colour rapidly at maturation, have revealed buried structures with great precision."
Aerial photographs taken at different times of day will help show the outlines of structures by changes in shadows.
"Magnetometers detect minute deviations in the Earth's magnetic field caused by iron artifacts, kilns, some types of stone structures, and even ditches and middens."
Devices that measure the electrical resistivity of the soil are also widely used.
Archaeological features whose electrical resistivity contrasts with that of surrounding soils can be detected and mapped.
"Some archaeological features (such as those composed of stone or brick) have higher resistivity than typical soils, while others (such as organic deposits or unfired clay) tend to have lower resistivity."
"Although some archaeologists consider the use of metal detectors to be tantamount to treasure hunting, others deem them an effective tool in archaeological surveying."
"Examples of formal archaeological use of metal detectors include musketball distribution analysis on English Civil War battlefields, metal distribution analysis prior to excavation of a 19th-century ship wreck, and service cable location during evaluation."
Metal detectorists have also contributed to archaeology where they have made detailed records of their results and refrained from raising artifacts from their archaeological context.
"In the UK, metal detectorists have been solicited for involvement in the Portable Antiquities Scheme."
"Regional survey in underwater archaeology uses geophysical or remote sensing devices such as marine magnetometer, side-scan sonar, or sub-bottom sonar."
"It can reveal several types of information usually not accessible to survey, such as stratigraphy, three-dimensional structure, and verifiably primary context."
"Modern excavation techniques require that the precise locations of objects and features, known as their provenance or provenience, be recorded."
"This always involves determining their horizontal locations, and sometimes vertical position as well (also see Primary Laws of Archaeology)."
"Likewise, their association, or relationship with nearby objects and features, needs to be recorded for later analysis."
This allows the archaeologist to deduce which artifacts and features were likely used together and which may be from different phases of activity.
"For example, excavation of a site reveals its stratigraphy; if a site was occupied by a succession of distinct cultures, artifacts from more recent cultures will lie above those from more ancient cultures."
"Excavation is the most expensive phase of archaeological research, in relative terms."
"Also, as a destructive process, it carries ethical concerns."
"As a result, very few sites are excavated in their entirety."
"Again the percentage of a site excavated depends greatly on the country and ""method statement"" issued."
Sampling is even more important in excavation than in survey.
"Sometimes large mechanical equipment, such as backhoes (JCBs), is used in excavation, especially to remove the topsoil (overburden), though this method is increasingly used with great caution."
"Following this rather dramatic step, the exposed area is usually hand-cleaned with trowels or hoes to ensure that all features are apparent."
The next task is to form a site plan and then use it to help decide the method of excavation.
Features dug into the natural subsoil are normally excavated in portions to produce a visible archaeological section for recording.
"A feature, for example a pit or a ditch, consists of two parts: the cut and the fill."
"The cut describes the edge of the feature, where the feature meets the natural soil."
"The fill is what the feature is filled with, and will often appear quite distinct from the natural soil."
The cut and fill are given consecutive numbers for recording purposes.
"Scaled plans and sections of individual features are all drawn on site, black and white and colour photographs of them are taken, and recording sheets are filled in describing the context of each."
All this information serves as a permanent record of the now-destroyed archaeology and is used in describing and interpreting the site.
"This process is known as post-excavation analysis, and is usually the most time-consuming part of an archaeological investigation."
It is not uncommon for final excavation reports for major sites to take years to be published.
"At a basic level of analysis, artifacts found are cleaned, catalogued and compared to published collections."
This comparison process often involves classifying them typologically and identifying other sites with similar artifact assemblages.
"However, a much more comprehensive range of analytical techniques are available through archaeological science, meaning that artifacts can be dated and their compositions examined."
"Bones, plants, and pollen collected from a site can all be analyzed using the methods of zooarchaeology, paleoethnobotany, palynology and stable isotopes while any texts can usually be deciphered."
"These techniques frequently provide information that would not otherwise be known, and therefore they contribute greatly to the understanding of a site."
"Photogrammetry is also used as an analytical tool, and digital topographical models have been combined with astronomical calculations to verify whether or not certain structures (such as pillars) were aligned with astronomical events such as the sun's position at a solstice."
Agent-based modeling and simulation can be used to better understand past social dynamics and outcomes.
Data mining can be applied to large bodies of archaeological 'grey literature'.
"In England, archaeologists have uncovered layouts of 14th century medieval villages, abandoned after crises such as the Black Death."
"In downtown New York City, archaeologists have exhumed the 18th century remains of the African Burial Ground."
"When remnants of the WWII Siegfried Line were being destroyed, emergency archaeological digs took place whenever any part of the line was removed, to further scientific knowledge and reveal details of the line's construction."
"The approach first gained prominence during the processual movement of the 1960s, and continues to be a vibrant component of post-processual and other current archaeological approaches."
Early ethnoarchaeological research focused on hunter-gatherer or foraging societies; today ethnoarchaeological research encompasses a much wider range of human behaviour.
In the context of the logical positivism of processualism with its goals of improving the scientific rigor of archaeological epistemologies the experimental method gained importance.
Experimental techniques remain a crucial component to improving the inferential frameworks for interpreting the archaeological record.
"It emphasizes the application of analytical techniques from physics, chemistry, and engineering."
It is a field of research that frequently focuses on the definition of the chemical composition of archaeological remains for source analysis.
"Archaeometry also investigates different spatial characteristics of features, employing methods such as space syntax techniques and geodesy as well as computer-based tools such as geographic information system technology."
Rare earth elements patterns may also be used.
"A relatively nascent subfield is that of archaeological materials, designed to enhance understanding of prehistoric and non-industrial culture through scientific analysis of the structure and properties of materials associated with human activity."
CRM archaeologists frequently examine archaeological sites that are threatened by development.
"Today, CRM accounts for most of the archaeological research done in the United States and much of that in western Europe as well."
"In the US, CRM archaeology has been a growing concern since the passage of the National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966, and most taxpayers, scholars, and politicians believe that CRM has helped preserve much of that nation's history and prehistory that would have otherwise been lost in the expansion of cities, dams, and highways."
"Along with other statutes, the NHPA mandates that projects on federal land or involving federal funds or permits consider the effects of the project on each archaeological site."
The application of CRM in the United Kingdom is not limited to government-funded projects.
"Since 1990, PPG 16 has required planners to consider archaeology as a material consideration in determining applications for new development."
"As a result, numerous archaeological organizations undertake mitigation work in advance of (or during) construction work in archaeologically sensitive areas, at the developer's expense."
"In England, ultimate responsibility of care for the historic environment rests with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport in association with English Heritage."
"In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the same responsibilities lie with Historic Scotland, Cadw and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency respectively."
"In France, the Institut national du patrimoine (The National Institute of Cultural Heritage) trains curators specialized in archaeology."
Their mission is to enhance the objects discovered.
"The curator is the link between scientific knowledge, administrative regulations, heritage objects and the public."
"Among the goals of CRM are the identification, preservation, and maintenance of cultural sites on public and private lands, and the removal of culturally valuable materials from areas where they would otherwise be destroyed by human activity, such as proposed construction."
This study involves at least a cursory examination to determine whether or not any significant archaeological sites are present in the area affected by the proposed construction.
"If these do exist, time and money must be allotted for their excavation."
"If initial survey and/or test excavations indicate the presence of an extraordinarily valuable site, the construction may be prohibited entirely."
"Cultural resources management has, however, been criticized."
CRM is conducted by private companies that bid for projects by submitting proposals outlining the work to be done and an expected budget.
It is not unheard-of for the agency responsible for the construction to simply choose the proposal that asks for the least funding.
"CRM archaeologists face considerable time pressure, often being forced to complete their work in a fraction of the time that might be allotted for a purely scholarly endeavour."
Compounding the time pressure is the vetting process of site reports that are required (in the US) to be submitted by CRM firms to the appropriate State Historic Preservation Office (SHPO).
"From the SHPO's perspective there is to be no difference between a report submitted by a CRM firm operating under a deadline, and a multi-year academic project."
"The end result is that for a Cultural Resource Management archaeologist to be successful, they must be able to produce academic quality documents at a corporate world pace."
"The annual ratio of open academic archaeology positions (inclusive of post-doc, temporary, and non- tenure track appointments) to the annual number of archaeology MA/MSc and PhD students is disproportionate."
"Cultural Resource Management, once considered an intellectual backwater for individuals with ""strong backs and weak minds,"" has attracted these graduates, and CRM offices are thus increasingly staffed by advance degreed individuals with a track record of producing scholarly articles but who also have extensive CRM field experience."
This happens on the one hand through international agreements and on the other hand through organizations that monitor or enforce protection.
"United Nations, UNESCO and Blue Shield International deal with the protection of cultural heritage and thus also archaeological sites."
This also applies to the integration of United Nations peacekeeping.
"Blue Shield International has undertaken various fact-finding missions in recent years to protect archaeological sites during the wars in Libya, Syria, Egypt and Lebanon."
"If you destroy their culture, you also destroy their identity."
"Many people are uprooted, often have no prospects anymore and subsequently flee from their homeland."""
This general tendency laid the foundation for the modern popular view of archaeology and archaeologists.
Many of the public view archaeology as something only available to a narrow demographic.
"The job of archaeologist is depicted as a ""romantic adventurist occupation""."
and as a hobby more than a job in the scientific community.
"Cinema audiences form a notion of ""who archaeologists are, why they do what they do, and how relationships to the past are constituted"", and is often under the impression that all archaeology takes place in a distant and foreign land, only to collect monetarily or spiritually priceless artifacts."
The modern depiction of archaeology has incorrectly formed the public's perception of what archaeology is.
"Much thorough and productive research has indeed been conducted in dramatic locales such as Copán and the Valley of the Kings, but the bulk of activities and finds of modern archaeology are not so sensational."
"Archaeological adventure stories tend to ignore the painstaking work involved in carrying out modern surveys, excavations, and data processing."
"Some archaeologists refer to such off-the-mark portrayals as ""pseudoarchaeology""."
Archaeologists are also very much reliant on public support; the question of exactly who they are doing their work for is often discussed.
"They seek to stop looting by combatting people who illegally take artifacts from protected sites, and by alerting people who live near archaeological sites of the threat of looting."
"Common methods of public outreach include press releases, the encouragement of school field trips to sites under excavation by professional archaeologists, and making reports and publications accessible outside of academia."
Public appreciation of the significance of archaeology and archaeological sites often leads to improved protection from encroaching development or other threats.
One audience for archaeologists' work is the public.
"They increasingly realize that their work can benefit non-academic and non-archaeological audiences, and that they have a responsibility to educate and inform the public about archaeology."
"Local heritage awareness is aimed at increasing civic and individual pride through projects such as community excavation projects, and better public presentations of archaeological sites and knowledge."
"of Agriculture, Forest Service (USFS) operates a volunteer archaeology and historic preservation program called the Passport in Time (PIT)."
"The Mardi Gras Shipwreck Project integrated a one-hour HD documentary, short videos for public viewing and video updates during the expedition as part of the educational outreach."
Webcasting is also another tool for educational outreach.
"For one week in 2000 and 2001, live underwater video of the Queen Anne's Revenge Shipwreck Project was webcast to the Internet as a part of the QAR DiveLive educational program that reached thousands of children around the world."
"Where possible, archaeologists now make more provisions for public involvement and outreach in larger projects than they once did, and many local archaeological organizations operate within the Community archaeology framework to expand public involvement in smaller-scale, more local projects."
"Archaeological excavation, however, is best undertaken by well-trained staff that can work quickly and accurately."
Often this requires observing the necessary health and safety and indemnity insurance issues involved in working on a modern building site with tight deadlines.
Certain charities and local government bodies sometimes offer places on research projects either as part of academic work or as a defined community project.
"Often archaeologists are assisted by the public in the locating of archaeological sites, which professional archaeologists have neither the funding, nor the time to do."
"ALI founded a website, The Archaeology Channel to support the organization's mission ""to nurturing and bringing attention to the human cultural heritage, by using media in the most efficient and effective ways possible."""
"It includes much fictional archaeological work (discussed above), as well as some actual activity."
"Many non-fiction authors have ignored the scientific methods of processual archaeology, or the specific critiques of it contained in post-processualism."
"His 1968 book, Chariots of the Gods?, together with many subsequent lesser-known works, expounds a theory of ancient contacts between human civilization on Earth and more technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilizations."
"This theory, known as palaeocontact theory, or Ancient astronaut theory, is not exclusively Däniken's, nor did the idea originate with him."
"Works of this nature are usually marked by the renunciation of well-established theories on the basis of limited evidence, and the interpretation of evidence with a preconceived theory in mind."
"For instance, many of the tombs of the Egyptian pharaohs were looted during antiquity."
"Archaeology stimulates interest in ancient objects, and people in search of artifacts or treasure cause damage to archaeological sites."
The commercial and academic demand for artifacts unfortunately contributes directly to the illicit antiquities trade.
Smuggling of antiquities abroad to private collectors has caused great cultural and economic damage in many countries whose governments lack the resources and or the will to deter it.
"Looters damage and destroy archaeological sites, denying future generations information about their ethnic and cultural heritage."
"For years, American archaeologists dug on Indian burial grounds and other places considered sacred, removing artifacts and human remains to storage facilities for further study."
In some cases human remains were not even thoroughly studied but instead archived rather than reburied.
"Furthermore, Western archaeologists' views of the past often differ from those of tribal peoples."
"The West views time as linear; for many natives, it is cyclic."
"From a Western perspective, the past is long-gone; from a native perspective, disturbing the past can have dire consequences in the present."
"As a consequence of this, American Indians attempted to prevent archaeological excavation of sites inhabited by their ancestors, while American archaeologists believed that the advancement of scientific knowledge was a valid reason to continue their studies."
"This contradictory situation was addressed by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA, 1990), which sought to reach a compromise by limiting the right of research institutions to possess human remains."
"Due in part to the spirit of postprocessualism, some archaeologists have begun to actively enlist the assistance of indigenous peoples likely to be descended from those under study."
Archaeologists have also been obliged to re-examine what constitutes an archaeological site in view of what native peoples believe to constitute sacred space.
"To many native peoples, natural features such as lakes, mountains or even individual trees have cultural significance."
Australian archaeologists especially have explored this issue and attempted to survey these sites to give them some protection from being developed.
Such work requires close links and trust between archaeologists and the people they are trying to help and at the same time study.
"While this cooperation presents a new set of challenges and hurdles to fieldwork, it has benefits for all parties involved."
"Tribal elders cooperating with archaeologists can prevent the excavation of areas of sites that they consider sacred, while the archaeologists gain the elders' aid in interpreting their finds."
There have also been active efforts to recruit aboriginal peoples directly into the archaeological profession.
"An example of this occurred on 21 June 2005, when community members and elders from a number of the 10 Algonquian nations in the Ottawa area convened on the Kitigan Zibi reservation near Maniwaki, Quebec, to inter ancestral human remains and burial goods—some dating back 6,000 years."
"It was not determined, however, if the remains were directly related to the Algonquin people who now inhabit the region."
"The remains may be of Iroquoian ancestry, since Iroquoian people inhabited the area before the Algonquin."
"Moreover, the oldest of these remains might have no relation at all to the Algonquin or Iroquois, and belong to an earlier culture who previously inhabited the area."
"The remains and artifacts, including jewelry, tools and weapons, were originally excavated from various sites in the Ottawa Valley, including Morrison and the Allumette Islands."
"They had been part of the Canadian Museum of Civilization's research collection for decades, some since the late 19th century."
"Elders from various Algonquin communities conferred on an appropriate reburial, eventually deciding on traditional redcedar and birchbark boxes lined with redcedar chips, muskrat and beaver pelts."
An inconspicuous rock mound marks the reburial site where close to 80 boxes of various sizes are buried.
"Because of this reburial, no further scientific study is possible."
A computer is a machine that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming.
"Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs."
These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
"A ""complete"" computer including the hardware, the operating system (main software), and peripheral equipment required and used for ""full"" operation can be referred to as a computer system."
"This term may as well be used for a group of computers that are connected and work together, in particular a computer network or computer cluster."
Computers are used as control systems for a wide variety of industrial and consumer devices.
"This includes simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer-aided design, and also general-purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones."
The Internet is run on computers and it connects hundreds of millions of other computers and their users.
Early computers were only conceived as calculating devices.
"Since ancient times, simple manual devices like the abacus aided people in doing calculations."
"Early in the Industrial Revolution, some mechanical devices were built to automate long tedious tasks, such as guiding patterns for looms."
More sophisticated electrical machines did specialized analog calculations in the early 20th century.
The first digital electronic calculating machines were developed during World War II.
"The speed, power and versatility of computers have been increasing dramatically ever since then, with transistor counts increasing at a rapid pace (as predicted by Moore's law), leading to the Digital Revolution during the late 20th to early 21st centuries."
"Conventionally, a modern computer consists of at least one processing element, typically a central processing unit (CPU) in the form of a microprocessor, along with some type of computer memory, typically semiconductor memory chips."
"The processing element carries out arithmetic and logical operations, and a sequencing and control unit can change the order of operations in response to stored information."
Peripheral devices allow information to be retrieved from an external source and they enable the result of operations to be saved and retrieved.
"This usage of the term referred to a human computer, a person who carried out calculations or computations."
The word continued with the same meaning until the middle of the 20th century.
During the latter part of this period women were often hired as computers because they could be paid less than their male counterparts.
"The Online Etymology Dictionary indicates that the ""modern use"" of the term, to mean ""programmable digital electronic computer"" dates from ""1945 under this name; [in a] theoretical [sense] from 1937, as Turing machine""."
The earliest counting device was probably a form of tally stick.
"which represented counts of items, probably livestock or grains, sealed in hollow unbaked clay containers."
The use of counting rods is one example.
The abacus was initially used for arithmetic tasks.
The Roman abacus was developed from devices used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC.
"Since then, many other forms of reckoning boards or tables have been invented."
"In a medieval European counting house, a checkered cloth would be placed on a table, and markers moved around on it according to certain rules, as an aid to calculating sums of money."
It was designed to calculate astronomical positions.
Devices of a level of complexity comparable to that of the Antikythera mechanism would not reappear until a thousand years later.
Many mechanical aids to calculation and measurement were constructed for astronomical and navigation use.
The astrolabe was invented in the Hellenistic world in either the 1st or 2nd centuries BC and is often attributed to Hipparchus.
"A combination of the planisphere and dioptra, the astrolabe was effectively an analog computer capable of working out several different kinds of problems in spherical astronomy."
"An astrolabe incorporating a mechanical calendar computer and gear-wheels was invented by Abi Bakr of Isfahan, Persia in 1235."
"The sector, a calculating instrument used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation."
The planimeter was a manual instrument to calculate the area of a closed figure by tracing over it with a mechanical linkage.
It is a hand-operated analog computer for doing multiplication and division.
"As slide rule development progressed, added scales provided reciprocals, squares and square roots, cubes and cube roots, as well as transcendental functions such as logarithms and exponentials, circular and hyperbolic trigonometry and other functions."
"Slide rules with special scales are still used for quick performance of routine calculations, such as the E6B circular slide rule used for time and distance calculations on light aircraft."
"In the 1770s, Pierre Jaquet-Droz, a Swiss watchmaker, built a mechanical doll (automaton) that could write holding a quill pen."
"By switching the number and order of its internal wheels different letters, and hence different messages, could be produced."
"In effect, it could be mechanically ""programmed"" to read instructions."
The tide-predicting machine invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872 was of great utility to navigation in shallow waters.
It used a system of pulleys and wires to automatically calculate predicted tide levels for a set period at a particular location.
"The differential analyser, a mechanical analog computer designed to solve differential equations by integration, used wheel-and-disc mechanisms to perform the integration."
"In 1876, Lord Kelvin had already discussed the possible construction of such calculators, but he had been stymied by the limited output torque of the ball-and-disk integrators."
"In a differential analyzer, the output of one integrator drove the input of the next integrator, or a graphing output."
The torque amplifier was the advance that allowed these machines to work.
"Starting in the 1920s, Vannevar Bush and others developed mechanical differential analyzers."
"Considered the ""father of the computer"", he conceptualized and invented the first mechanical computer in the early 19th century."
"After working on his revolutionary difference engine, designed to aid in navigational calculations, in 1833 he realized that a much more general design, an Analytical Engine, was possible."
"The input of programs and data was to be provided to the machine via punched cards, a method being used at the time to direct mechanical looms such as the Jacquard loom."
"For output, the machine would have a printer, a curve plotter and a bell."
The machine would also be able to punch numbers onto cards to be read in later.
All the parts for his machine had to be made by hand – this was a major problem for a device with thousands of parts.
"Eventually, the project was dissolved with the decision of the British Government to cease funding."
Babbage's failure to complete the analytical engine can be chiefly attributed to political and financial difficulties as well as his desire to develop an increasingly sophisticated computer and to move ahead faster than anyone else could follow.
He gave a successful demonstration of its use in computing tables in 1906.
"However, these were not programmable and generally lacked the versatility and accuracy of modern digital computers."
"The first modern analog computer was a tide-predicting machine, invented by Sir William Thomson in 1872."
A dozen of these devices were built before their obsolescence became obvious.
"By the 1950s, the success of digital electronic computers had spelled the end for most analog computing machines, but analog computers remained in use during the 1950s in some specialized applications such as education (slide rule) and aircraft (control systems)."
"This was the Torpedo Data Computer, which used trigonometry to solve the problem of firing a torpedo at a moving target."
During World War II similar devices were developed in other countries as well.
Early digital computers were electromechanical; electric switches drove mechanical relays to perform the calculation.
"These devices had a low operating speed and were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers, originally using vacuum tubes."
"The Z3 was built with 2000 relays, implementing a 22 bit word length that operated at a clock frequency of about 5–10 Hz."
Program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored in 64 words of memory or supplied from the keyboard.
"It was quite similar to modern machines in some respects, pioneering numerous advances such as floating point numbers."
"Rather than the harder-to-implement decimal system (used in Charles Babbage's earlier design), using a binary system meant that Zuse's machines were easier to build and potentially more reliable, given the technologies available at that time."
The Z3 was not itself a universal computer but could be extended to be Turing complete.
"The engineer Tommy Flowers, working at the Post Office Research Station in London in the 1930s, began to explore the possible use of electronics for the telephone exchange."
"Experimental equipment that he built in 1934 went into operation five years later, converting a portion of the telephone exchange network into an electronic data processing system, using thousands of vacuum tubes."
"This design was also all-electronic and used about 300 vacuum tubes, with capacitors fixed in a mechanically rotating drum for memory."
"During World War II, the British at Bletchley Park achieved a number of successes at breaking encrypted German military communications."
"The German encryption machine, Enigma, was first attacked with the help of the electro-mechanical bombes which were often run by women."
"To crack the more sophisticated German Lorenz SZ 40/42 machine, used for high-level Army communications, Max Newman and his colleagues commissioned Flowers to build the Colossus."
He spent eleven months from early February 1943 designing and building the first Colossus.
"It had paper-tape input and was capable of being configured to perform a variety of boolean logical operations on its data, but it was not Turing-complete."
"Although the ENIAC was similar to the Colossus, it was much faster, more flexible, and it was Turing-complete."
"Like the Colossus, a ""program"" on the ENIAC was defined by the states of its patch cables and switches, a far cry from the stored program electronic machines that came later."
"Once a program was written, it had to be mechanically set into the machine with manual resetting of plugs and switches."
"It could add or subtract 5000 times a second, a thousand times faster than any other machine."
"It also had modules to multiply, divide, and square root."
High speed memory was limited to 20 words (about 80 bytes).
"The machine was huge, weighing 30 tons, using 200 kilowatts of electric power and contained over 18,000 vacuum tubes, 1,500 relays, and hundreds of thousands of resistors, capacitors, and inductors."
"Turing proposed a simple device that he called ""Universal Computing machine"" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine."
"He proved that such a machine is capable of computing anything that is computable by executing instructions (program) stored on tape, allowing the machine to be programmable."
"The fundamental concept of Turing's design is the stored program, where all the instructions for computing are stored in memory."
Von Neumann acknowledged that the central concept of the modern computer was due to this paper.
Turing machines are to this day a central object of study in theory of computation.
"Except for the limitations imposed by their finite memory stores, modern computers are said to be Turing-complete, which is to say, they have algorithm execution capability equivalent to a universal Turing machine."
Changing its function required the re-wiring and re-structuring of the machine.
With the proposal of the stored-program computer this changed.
A stored-program computer includes by design an instruction set and can store in memory a set of instructions (a program) that details the computation.
The theoretical basis for the stored-program computer was laid by Alan Turing in his 1936 paper.
"In 1945, Turing joined the National Physical Laboratory and began work on developing an electronic stored-program digital computer."
"His 1945 report ""Proposed Electronic Calculator"" was the first specification for such a device."
"It was designed as a testbed for the Williams tube, the first random-access digital storage device."
"Although the computer was considered ""small and primitive"" by the standards of its time, it was the first working machine to contain all of the elements essential to a modern electronic computer."
"As soon as the Baby had demonstrated the feasibility of its design, a project was initiated at the university to develop it into a more usable computer, the Manchester Mark 1."
"Built by Ferranti, it was delivered to the University of Manchester in February 1951."
"At least seven of these later machines were delivered between 1953 and 1957, one of them to Shell labs in Amsterdam."
The LEO I computer became operational in April 1951 and ran the world's first regular routine office computer job.
"John Bardeen and Walter Brattain, while working under William Shockley at Bell Labs, built the first working transistor, the point-contact transistor, in 1947, which was followed by Shockley's bipolar junction transistor in 1948."
"From 1955 onwards, transistors replaced vacuum tubes in computer designs, giving rise to the ""second generation"" of computers."
"Compared to vacuum tubes, transistors have many advantages: they are smaller, and require less power than vacuum tubes, so give off less heat."
"Junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes and had longer, indefinite, service life."
Transistorized computers could contain tens of thousands of binary logic circuits in a relatively compact space.
"Their first transistorised computer and the first in the world, was operational by 1953, and a second version was completed there in April 1955."
"However, the machine did make use of valves to generate its 125 kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry to read and write on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorized computer."
"That distinction goes to the Harwell CADET of 1955, built by the electronics division of the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell."
It was the first truly compact transistor that could be miniaturised and mass-produced for a wide range of uses.
"With its high scalability, and much lower power consumption and higher density than bipolar junction transistors, the MOSFET made it possible to build high-density integrated circuits."
"In addition to data processing, it also enabled the practical use of MOS transistors as memory cell storage elements, leading to the development of MOS semiconductor memory, which replaced earlier magnetic-core memory in computers."
"The MOSFET led to the microcomputer revolution, and became the driving force behind the computer revolution."
"The MOSFET is the most widely used transistor in computers, and is the fundamental building block of digital electronics."
"Kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning the integrated circuit in July 1958, successfully demonstrating the first working integrated example on 12 September 1958."
"However, Kilby's invention was a hybrid integrated circuit (hybrid IC), rather than a monolithic integrated circuit (IC) chip."
Noyce's invention was the first true monolithic IC chip.
His chip solved many practical problems that Kilby's had not.
"Produced at Fairchild Semiconductor, it was made of silicon, whereas Kilby's chip was made of germanium."
"Noyce's monolithic IC was fabricated using the planar process, developed by his colleague Jean Hoerni in early 1959."
"After the first MOSFET was invented by Mohamed Atalla and Dawon Kahng at Bell Labs in 1959, Atalla first proposed the concept of the MOS integrated circuit in 1960, followed by Kahng in 1961, both noting that the MOS transistor's ease of fabrication made it useful for integrated circuits."
The earliest experimental MOS IC to be fabricated was a 16-transistor chip built by Fred Heiman and Steven Hofstein at RCA in 1962.
"General Microelectronics later introduced the first commercial MOS IC in 1964, developed by Robert Norman."
"While the subject of exactly which device was the first microprocessor is contentious, partly due to lack of agreement on the exact definition of the term ""microprocessor"", it is largely undisputed that the first single-chip microprocessor was the Intel 4004, designed and realized by Federico Faggin with his silicon-gate MOS IC technology, along with Ted Hoff, Masatoshi Shima and Stanley Mazor at Intel."
They may or may not have integrated RAM and flash memory.
"If not integrated, The RAM is usually placed directly above (known as Package on package) or below (on the opposite side of the circuit board) the SoC, and the flash memory is usually placed right next to the SoC, this all done to improve data transfer speeds, as the data signals don't have to travel long distances."
Later portables such as the Osborne 1 and Compaq Portable were considerably lighter but still needed to be plugged in.
"The first laptops, such as the Grid Compass, removed this requirement by incorporating batteries – and with the continued miniaturization of computing resources and advancements in portable battery life, portable computers grew in popularity in the 2000s."
The same developments allowed manufacturers to integrate computing resources into cellular mobile phones by the early 2000s.
These smartphones and tablets run on a variety of operating systems and recently became the dominant computing device on the market.
"These are powered by System on a Chip (SoCs), which are complete computers on a microchip the size of a coin."
"Circuits, computer chips, graphic cards, sound cards, memory (RAM), motherboard, displays, power supplies, cables, keyboards, printers and ""mice"" input devices are all hardware."
"These parts are interconnected by buses, often made of groups of wires."
Inside each of these parts are thousands to trillions of small electrical circuits which can be turned off or on by means of an electronic switch.
"Each circuit represents a bit (binary digit) of information so that when the circuit is on it represents a ""1"", and when off it represents a ""0"" (in positive logic representation)."
The circuits are arranged in logic gates so that one or more of the circuits may control the state of one or more of the other circuits.
The input devices may be hand-operated or automated.
The act of processing is mainly regulated by the CPU.
Control systems in advanced computers may change the order of execution of some instructions to improve performance.
Decode the numerical code for the instruction into a set of commands or signals for each of the other systems.
Increment the program counter so it points to the next instruction.
Read whatever data the instruction requires from cells in memory (or perhaps from an input device).
The location of this required data is typically stored within the instruction code.
Provide the necessary data to an ALU or register.
"If the instruction requires an ALU or specialized hardware to complete, instruct the hardware to perform the requested operation."
Write the result from the ALU back to a memory location or to a register or perhaps an output device.
Adding 100 to the program counter would cause the next instruction to be read from a place 100 locations further down the program.
"Instructions that modify the program counter are often known as ""jumps"" and allow for loops (instructions that are repeated by the computer) and often conditional instruction execution (both examples of control flow)."
"The sequence of operations that the control unit goes through to process an instruction is in itself like a short computer program, and indeed, in some more complex CPU designs, there is another yet smaller computer called a microsequencer, which runs a microcode program that causes all of these events to happen."
Early CPUs were composed of many separate components.
"Since the 1970s, CPUs have typically been constructed on a single MOS integrated circuit chip called a microprocessor."
"Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) while others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision."
"However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform."
"Therefore, any computer can be programmed to perform any arithmetic operation—although it will take more time to do so if its ALU does not directly support the operation."
"An ALU may also compare numbers and return boolean truth values (true or false) depending on whether one is equal to, greater than or less than the other (""is 64 greater than 65?"")."
These can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements and processing boolean logic.
"Superscalar computers may contain multiple ALUs, allowing them to process several instructions simultaneously."
Graphics processors and computers with SIMD and MIMD features often contain ALUs that can perform arithmetic on vectors and matrices.
"Each cell has a numbered ""address"" and can store a single number."
The information stored in memory may represent practically anything.
"Letters, numbers, even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease."
"Since the CPU does not differentiate between different types of information, it is the software's responsibility to give significance to what the memory sees as nothing but a series of numbers."
"In almost all modern computers, each memory cell is set up to store binary numbers in groups of eight bits (called a byte)."
"To store larger numbers, several consecutive bytes may be used (typically, two, four or eight)."
"When negative numbers are required, they are usually stored in two's complement notation."
"Other arrangements are possible, but are usually not seen outside of specialized applications or historical contexts."
A computer can store any kind of information in memory if it can be represented numerically.
Modern computers have billions or even trillions of bytes of memory.
The CPU contains a special set of memory cells called registers that can be read and written to much more rapidly than the main memory area.
There are typically between two and one hundred registers depending on the type of CPU.
Registers are used for the most frequently needed data items to avoid having to access main memory every time data is needed.
"As data is constantly being worked on, reducing the need to access main memory (which is often slow compared to the ALU and control units) greatly increases the computer's speed."
ROM is typically used to store the computer's initial start-up instructions.
"In general, the contents of RAM are erased when the power to the computer is turned off, but ROM retains its data indefinitely."
"In a PC, the ROM contains a specialized program called the BIOS that orchestrates loading the computer's operating system from the hard disk drive into RAM whenever the computer is turned on or reset."
"In embedded computers, which frequently do not have disk drives, all of the required software may be stored in ROM."
"Software stored in ROM is often called firmware, because it is notionally more like hardware than software."
"Flash memory blurs the distinction between ROM and RAM, as it retains its data when turned off but is also rewritable."
"Generally computers with this sort of cache are designed to move frequently needed data into the cache automatically, often without the need for any intervention on the programmer's part."
Devices that provide input or output to the computer are called peripherals.
"On a typical personal computer, peripherals include input devices like the keyboard and mouse, and output devices such as the display and printer."
"Hard disk drives, floppy disk drives and optical disc drives serve as both input and output devices."
"I/O devices are often complex computers in their own right, with their own CPU and memory."
A graphics processing unit might contain fifty or more tiny computers that perform the calculations necessary to display 3D graphics.
Modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist the main CPU in performing I/O.
A 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry.
having the computer switch rapidly between running each program in turn.
"One means by which this is done is with a special signal called an interrupt, which can periodically cause the computer to stop executing instructions where it was and do something else instead."
"By remembering where it was executing prior to the interrupt, the computer can return to that task later."
"then the interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second, causing a program switch each time."
"Since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders of magnitude faster than human perception, it may appear that many programs are running at the same time even though only one is ever executing in any given instant."
"Seemingly, multitasking would cause a computer that is switching between several programs to run more slowly, in direct proportion to the number of programs it is running, but most programs spend much of their time waiting for slow input/output devices to complete their tasks."
"If a program is waiting for the user to click on the mouse or press a key on the keyboard, then it will not take a ""time slice"" until the event it is waiting for has occurred."
This frees up time for other programs to execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss.
"Multiprocessor and multi-core (multiple CPUs on a single integrated circuit) personal and laptop computers are now widely available, and are being increasingly used in lower-end markets as a result."
Supercomputers in particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from the basic stored-program architecture and from general-purpose computers.
"They often feature thousands of CPUs, customized high-speed interconnects, and specialized computing hardware."
Such designs tend to be useful only for specialized tasks due to the large scale of program organization required to successfully utilize most of the available resources at once.
"Supercomputers usually see usage in large-scale simulation, graphics rendering, and cryptography applications, as well as with other so-called ""embarrassingly parallel"" tasks."
"Software is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built."
"Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media."
It is often divided into system software and application software Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
"When software is stored in hardware that cannot easily be modified, such as with BIOS ROM in an IBM PC compatible computer, it is sometimes called ""firmware""."
"That is to say that some type of instructions (the program) can be given to the computer, and it will process them."
Modern computers based on the von Neumann architecture often have machine code in the form of an imperative programming language.
"In practical terms, a computer program may be just a few instructions or extend to many millions of instructions, as do the programs for word processors and web browsers for example."
A typical modern computer can execute billions of instructions per second (gigaflops) and rarely makes a mistake over many years of operation.
"Large computer programs consisting of several million instructions may take teams of programmers years to write, and due to the complexity of the task almost certainly contain errors."
"In most cases, computer instructions are simple: add one number to another, move some data from one location to another, send a message to some external device, etc."
These instructions are read from the computer's memory and are generally carried out (executed) in the order they were given.
"However, there are usually specialized instructions to tell the computer to jump ahead or backwards to some other place in the program and to carry on executing from there."
"Furthermore, jump instructions may be made to happen conditionally so that different sequences of instructions may be used depending on the result of some previous calculation or some external event."
"Many computers directly support subroutines by providing a type of jump that ""remembers"" the location it jumped from and another instruction to return to the instruction following that jump instruction."
Program execution might be likened to reading a book.
"While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest."
"Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met."
This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.
"Comparatively, a person using a pocket calculator can perform a basic arithmetic operation such as adding two numbers with just a few button presses."
"But to add together all of the numbers from 1 to 1,000 would take thousands of button presses and a lot of time, with a near certainty of making a mistake."
"On the other hand, a computer may be programmed to do this with just a few simple instructions."
It will almost never make a mistake and a modern PC can complete the task in a fraction of a second.
"The command to add two numbers together would have one opcode; the command to multiply them would have a different opcode, and so on."
"The simplest computers are able to perform any of a handful of different instructions; the more complex computers have several hundred to choose from, each with a unique numerical code."
"Since the computer's memory is able to store numbers, it can also store the instruction codes."
This leads to the important fact that entire programs (which are just lists of these instructions) can be represented as lists of numbers and can themselves be manipulated inside the computer in the same way as numeric data.
"The fundamental concept of storing programs in the computer's memory alongside the data they operate on is the crux of the von Neumann, or stored program, architecture."
"In some cases, a computer might store some or all of its program in memory that is kept separate from the data it operates on."
This is called the Harvard architecture after the Harvard Mark I computer.
"Modern von Neumann computers display some traits of the Harvard architecture in their designs, such as in CPU caches."
"While it is possible to write computer programs as long lists of numbers (machine language) and while this technique was used with many early computers, it is extremely tedious and potentially error-prone to do so in practice, especially for complicated programs."
"Instead, each basic instruction can be given a short name that is indicative of its function and easy to remember – a mnemonic such as ADD, SUB, MULT or JUMP."
These mnemonics are collectively known as a computer's assembly language.
Converting programs written in assembly language into something the computer can actually understand (machine language) is usually done by a computer program called an assembler.
"Unlike natural languages, programming languages are designed to permit no ambiguity and to be concise."
They are purely written languages and are often difficult to read aloud.
"They are generally either translated into machine code by a compiler or an assembler before being run, or translated directly at run time by an interpreter."
Sometimes programs are executed by a hybrid method of the two techniques.
"For instance, an ARM architecture CPU (such as may be found in a smartphone or a hand-held videogame) cannot understand the machine language of an x86 CPU that might be in a PC."
"Historically a significant number of other cpu architectures were created and saw extensive use, notably including the MOS Technology 6502 and 6510 in addition to the Zilog Z80."
"Therefore, most practical programs are written in more abstract high-level programming languages that are able to express the needs of the programmer more conveniently (and thereby help reduce programmer error)."
"High level languages are usually ""compiled"" into machine language (or sometimes into assembly language and then into machine language) using another computer program called a compiler."
"High level languages are less related to the workings of the target computer than assembly language, and more related to the language and structure of the problem(s) to be solved by the final program."
It is therefore often possible to use different compilers to translate the same high level language program into the machine language of many different types of computer.
This is part of the means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such as personal computers and various video game consoles.
"As problems become larger and more complex, features such as subprograms, modules, formal documentation, and new paradigms such as object-oriented programming are encountered."
Large programs involving thousands of line of code and more require formal software methodologies.
The task of developing large software systems presents a significant intellectual challenge.
Producing software with an acceptably high reliability within a predictable schedule and budget has historically been difficult; the academic and professional discipline of software engineering concentrates specifically on this challenge.
"They may be benign and not affect the usefulness of the program, or have only subtle effects."
"But in some cases, they may cause the program or the entire system to ""hang"", becoming unresponsive to input such as mouse clicks or keystrokes, to completely fail, or to crash."
"Otherwise benign bugs may sometimes be harnessed for malicious intent by an unscrupulous user writing an exploit, code designed to take advantage of a bug and disrupt a computer's proper execution."
Bugs are usually not the fault of the computer.
"Since computers merely execute the instructions they are given, bugs are nearly always the result of programmer error or an oversight made in the program's design."
"Admiral Grace Hopper, an American computer scientist and developer of the first compiler, is credited for having first used the term ""bugs"" in computing after a dead moth was found shorting a relay in the Harvard Mark II computer in September 1947."
"In the 1970s, computer engineers at research institutions throughout the United States began to link their computers together using telecommunications technology."
The technologies that made the Arpanet possible spread and evolved.
"In time, the network spread beyond academic and military institutions and became known as the Internet."
The emergence of networking involved a redefinition of the nature and boundaries of the computer.
"Computer operating systems and applications were modified to include the ability to define and access the resources of other computers on the network, such as peripheral devices, stored information, and the like, as extensions of the resources of an individual computer."
"Initially these facilities were available primarily to people working in high-tech environments, but in the 1990s the spread of applications like e-mail and the World Wide Web, combined with the development of cheap, fast networking technologies like Ethernet and ADSL saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous."
"In fact, the number of computers that are networked is growing phenomenally."
A very large proportion of personal computers regularly connect to the Internet to communicate and receive information.
"""Wireless"" networking, often utilizing mobile phone networks, has meant networking is becoming increasingly ubiquitous even in mobile computing environments."
"While popular usage of the word ""computer"" is synonymous with a personal electronic computer, the modern definition of a computer is literally: ""A device that computes, especially a programmable [usually] electronic machine that performs high-speed mathematical or logical operations or that assembles, stores, correlates, or otherwise processes information."""
"Any device which processes information qualifies as a computer, especially if the processing is purposeful."
"Most computers are universal, and are able to calculate any computable function, and are limited only by their memory capacity and operating speed."
However different designs of computers can give very different performance for particular problems; for example quantum computers can potentially break some modern encryption algorithms (by quantum factoring) very quickly.
Logic gates are a common abstraction which can apply to most of the above digital or analog paradigms.
"The ability to store and execute lists of instructions called programs makes computers extremely versatile, distinguishing them from calculators."
"is able to perform the same computational tasks, given enough time and storage capacity."
Computer programs that learn and adapt are part of the emerging field of artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Artificial intelligence based products generally fall into two major categories: rule based systems and pattern recognition systems.
Rule based systems attempt to represent the rules used by human experts and tend to be expensive to develop.
Pattern based systems use data about a problem to generate conclusions.
"Examples of pattern based systems include voice recognition, font recognition, translation and the emerging field of on-line marketing."
"The need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has spawned the need for many standards organizations, clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature."
The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are located primarily in Europe.
"The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states in those matters, and only those matters, where members have agreed to act as one."
"EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services and capital within the internal market; enact legislation in justice and home affairs; and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries and regional development."
Passport controls have been abolished for travel within the Schengen Area.
"The EU traces its origins to the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) and the European Economic Community (EEC), established, respectively, by the 1951 Treaty of Paris and 1957 Treaty of Rome."
"The original members of what came to be known as the European Communities were the Inner Six: Belgium, France, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, and West Germany."
The Communities and their successors have grown in size by the accession of new member states and in power by the addition of policy areas to their remit.
The United Kingdom became the first member state to leave the EU on 31 January 2020.
"Before this, three territories of member states had left the EU or its forerunners."
"The latest major amendment to the constitutional basis of the EU, the Treaty of Lisbon, came into force in 2009."
"Additionally, all EU countries have a very high Human Development Index according to the United Nations Development Programme."
"In 2012, the EU was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."
"Through the Common Foreign and Security Policy, the union has developed a role in external relations and defence."
"It maintains permanent diplomatic missions throughout the world and represents itself at the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, the G7 and the G20."
"Due to its global influence, the European Union has been described by some scholars as an emerging superpower."
The following timeline outlines the legal inception of the European Union (EU)—the principal framework for this unification.
"The EU inherited many of its present responsibilities from the European Communities (EC), which were founded in the 1950s in the spirit of the Schuman Declaration."
"This political philosophy of a supra-national rule over the continent, similar to the example of the ancient Roman Empire, resulted in the early Middle Ages in the concept of a renovatio imperii (""restoration of the empire""), either in the forms of the Reichsidee (""imperial idea"") or the religiously inspired Imperium Christianum (""christian empire"")."
"In the decades following the outcomes of the Congress of Vienna, ideals of European unity flourished across the continent, especially in the writings of Wojciech Jastrzębowski (1799–1882) or Giuseppe Mazzini (1805–1872)."
"During the interwar period, the consciousness that national markets in Europe were interdependent though confrontational, along with the observation of a larger and growing US market on the other side of the ocean, nourished the urge for the economic integration of the continent."
"During the same decade, Richard von Coudenhove-Kalergi, one of the first to imagine of a modern political union of Europe, founded the Pan-Europa Movement."
"His ideas influenced his contemporaries, among which then Prime Minister of France Aristide Briand."
"In 1929, the latter gave a speech in favour of a European Union before the assembly of the League of Nations, precursor of the United Nations."
"In a radio address in March 1943, with war still raging, Britain's leader Sir Winston Churchill spoke warmly of ""restoring the true greatness of Europe"" once victory had been achieved, and mused on the post-war creation of a ""Council of Europe"" which would bring the European nations together to build peace."
"In a speech delivered on 19 September 1946 at the University of Zürich, Switzerland, Winston Churchill went further and advocated the emergence of a United States of Europe."
"The Council focused primarily on values—human rights and democracy—rather than on economic or trade issues, and was always envisaged as a forum where sovereign governments could choose to work together, with no supra-national authority."
"It raised great hopes of further European integration, and there were fevered debates in the two years that followed as to how this could be achieved."
"But in 1952, disappointed at what they saw as the lack of progress within the Council of Europe, six nations decided to go further and created the European Coal and Steel Community, which was declared to be ""a first step in the federation of Europe""."
This community helped to economically integrate and coordinate the large number of Marshall Plan funds from the United States.
"European leaders Alcide De Gasperi from Italy, Jean Monnet and Robert Schuman from France, and Paul-Henri Spaak from Belgium understood that coal and steel were the two industries essential for waging war, and believed that by tying their national industries together, future war between their nations became much less likely."
These men and others are officially credited as the founding fathers of the European Union.
They also signed another pact creating the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom) for co-operation in developing nuclear energy.
The EEC was headed by Walter Hallstein (Hallstein Commission) and Euratom was headed by Louis Armand (Armand Commission) and then Étienne Hirsch.
"Nevertheless, in 1965 an agreement was reached and on 1 July 1967 the Merger Treaty created a single set of institutions for the three communities, which were collectively referred to as the European Communities."
"Norway had negotiated to join at the same time, but Norwegian voters rejected membership in a referendum."
"In 1985, the Schengen Agreement paved the way for the creation of open borders without passport controls between most member states and some non-member states."
"In 1986, the European flag began to be used by the EEC and the Single European Act was signed."
"In 1990, after the fall of the Eastern Bloc, the former East Germany became part of the Communities as part of a reunified Germany."
"The treaty also gave the name European Community to the EEC, even if it was referred as such before the treaty."
"With further enlargement planned to include the former communist states of Central and Eastern Europe, as well as Cyprus and Malta, the Copenhagen criteria for candidate members to join the EU were agreed upon in June 1993."
The expansion of the EU introduced a new level of complexity and discord.
"In 1995, Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined the EU."
"In 2002, euro banknotes and coins replaced national currencies in 12 of the member states."
"In 2004, the EU saw its biggest enlargement to date when Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia joined the Union."
"On 1 December 2009, the Lisbon Treaty entered into force and reformed many aspects of the EU."
"The UK formally notified the European Council of its decision to leave on 29 March 2017, initiating the formal withdrawal procedure for leaving the EU; following extensions to the process, the UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, though most areas of EU law continued to apply to the UK for a transition period which lasted until 23:00 GMT on 31 December 2020."
"In 2017, approximately 825,000 people acquired citizenship of a member state of the European Union."
"The largest groups were nationals of Morocco, Albania, India, Turkey and Pakistan."
"The European Commission conducts its internal business in three procedural languages: English, French, and German."
"English is the most widely spoken language in the EU, being understood by 51% of the EU population when counting both native and non-native speakers."
"German is the most widely spoken mother tongue (18% of the EU population), and the second most widely understood foreign language, followed by French (13% of the EU population)."
"In addition, both are official languages of several EU member states."
"Only four languages, namely Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian (all three Uralic), and Maltese (Semitic), are not Indo-European languages."
"On 26 February 2016 it was made public that Cyprus has asked to make Turkish an official EU language, in a ""gesture"" that could help solve the division of the country."
"Catalan, Galician and Basque are not recognised official languages of the European Union but have official status in one member state (Spain): therefore, official translations of the treaties are made into them and citizens have the right to correspond with the institutions in these languages."
The European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages ratified by most EU states provides general guidelines that states can follow to protect their linguistic heritage.
"The other world religions of Buddhism, Hinduism, and Sikhism are also represented in the EU population."
Many countries have experienced falling church attendance and membership in recent years.
"The most religious countries were Malta (95%, predominantly Catholic) as well as Cyprus and Romania (both predominantly Orthodox) each with about 90% of citizens professing a belief in their respective god."
"Across the EU, belief was higher among women, older people, those with religious upbringing, those who left school at 15 or 16, and those ""positioning themselves on the right of the political scale""."
"Countries accede to the union by becoming party to the founding treaties, thereby subjecting themselves to the privileges and obligations of EU membership."
"These require a stable democracy that respects human rights and the rule of law; a functioning market economy; and the acceptance of the obligations of membership, including EU law."
Evaluation of a country's fulfilment of the criteria is the responsibility of the European Council.
Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty provides the basis for a member to leave the Union.
"Two territories have left the Union: Greenland (an autonomous province of Denmark) withdrew in 1985; the United Kingdom formally invoked Article 50 of the Consolidated Treaty on European Union in 2017, and became the only sovereign state to leave when it withdrew from the EU in 2020."
"There are six countries that are recognised as candidates for membership: Albania, Iceland, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey, though Iceland suspended negotiations in 2013."
"Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognised as potential candidates, with Bosnia and Herzegovina having submitted a membership application."
"The four countries forming the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) are not EU members, but have partly committed to the EU's economy and regulations: Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway, which are a part of the single market through the European Economic Area, and Switzerland, which has similar ties through bilateral treaties."
"The relationships of the European microstates, Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City include the use of the euro and other areas of co-operation."
"Including the overseas territories of France which are located outside the continent of Europe, but which are members of the union, the EU experiences most types of climate from Arctic (north-east Europe) to tropical (French Guiana), rendering meteorological averages for the EU as a whole meaningless."
Laws made by the EU institutions are passed in a variety of forms.
"This is reflected in the fact that the member states remain the 'masters of the Treaties', retaining control over the allocation of competences to the Union through constitutional change (thus retaining so-called Kompetenz-kompetenz); in that they retain control of the use of armed force; they retain control of taxation; and in that they retain a right of unilateral withdrawal from the Union under Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union."
"In addition, the principle of subsidiarity requires that only those matters that need to be determined collectively are so determined."
"The European Union has seven principal decision-making bodies, its institutions: the European Parliament, the European Council, the Council of the European Union, the European Commission, the Court of Justice of the European Union, the European Central Bank and the European Court of Auditors."
"Competence in scrutinising and amending legislation is shared between the Council of the European Union and the European Parliament, while executive tasks are performed by the European Commission and in a limited capacity by the European Council (not to be confused with the aforementioned Council of the European Union)."
The monetary policy of the eurozone is determined by the European Central Bank.
The interpretation and the application of EU law and the treaties are ensured by the Court of Justice of the European Union.
The EU budget is scrutinised by the European Court of Auditors.
There are also a number of ancillary bodies which advise the EU or operate in a specific area.
"EU policy is in general promulgated by EU directives, which are then implemented in the domestic legislation of its member states, and EU regulations, which are immediately enforceable in all member states."
Lobbying at EU level by special interest groups is regulated to try to balance the aspirations of private initiatives with public interest decision-making process.
"It convenes at least four times a year and comprises the President of the European Council (currently Charles Michel), the President of the European Commission and one representative per member state (either its head of state or head of government)."
The High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (currently Josep Borrell) also takes part in its meetings.
"It has been described by some as the Union's ""supreme political authority""."
It is actively involved in the negotiation of treaty changes and defines the EU's policy agenda and strategies.
"The European Council uses its leadership role to sort out disputes between member states and the institutions, and to resolve political crises and disagreements over controversial issues and policies."
"The European Council should not be mistaken for the Council of Europe, an international organisation independent of the EU based in Strasbourg."
The commission is 'guardian of the Treaties' and is responsible for their efficient operation and policing.
"It operates de facto as a cabinet government, with 27 Commissioners for different areas of policy, one from each member state, though Commissioners are bound to represent the interests of the EU as a whole rather than their home state."
"One of the 27 is the President of the European Commission (Ursula von der Leyen for 2019–2024), appointed by the European Council, subject to the Parliament's approval."
"After the President, the most prominent Commissioner is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, who is ex-officio a Vice-President of the Commission and is also chosen by the European Council."
The other 26 Commissioners are subsequently appointed by the Council of the European Union in agreement with the nominated President.
The 27 Commissioners as a single body are subject to approval (or otherwise) by vote of the European Parliament.
It consists of a government minister from each member state and meets in different compositions depending on the policy area being addressed.
"Notwithstanding its different configurations, it is considered to be one single body."
"In addition to its legislative functions, the council also exercises executive functions in relations to the Common Foreign and Security Policy."
"In some policies, there are several member states that ally with strategic partners within the Union."
"Examples of such alliances include the Visegrad Group, Benelux, the Baltic Assembly, the New Hanseatic League, the Weimar Triangle, the Lublin Triangle, EU Med Group and the Craiova Group."
The 705 Members of the European Parliament (MEPs) are directly elected by EU citizens every five years on the basis of proportional representation.
MEPs are elected on a national basis and they sit according to political groups rather than their nationality.
"This process applies to nearly all areas, including the EU budget."
"The Parliament is the final body to approve or reject the proposed membership of the commission, and can attempt motions of censure on the commission by appeal to the Court of Justice."
The President of the European Parliament (currently David Sassoli) carries out the role of speaker in Parliament and represents it externally.
The President and Vice-Presidents are elected by MEPs every two and a half years.
The Court also gives opinions and proposals on financial legislation and anti-fraud actions.
The Parliament uses this to decide whether to approve the commission's handling of the budget.
"The European Court of Auditors has signed off the European Union accounts every year since 2007 and, while making it clear that the European Commission has more work to do, has highlighted that most of the errors take place at national level."
"In their report on 2009 the auditors found that five areas of Union expenditure, agriculture and the cohesion fund, were materially affected by error."
The budget may still be approved if Hungary and Poland withdraw their vetos after further negotiations in the Council and the European Council.
In some areas the EU enjoys exclusive competence.
These are areas in which member states have renounced any capacity to enact legislation.
In other areas the EU and its member states share the competence to legislate.
"While both can legislate, member states can only legislate to the extent to which the EU has not."
"Different legislative procedures are used within the same category of competence, and even with the same policy area."
"These first established the European Community and the EU, and then made amendments to those founding treaties."
These are power-giving treaties which set broad policy goals and establish institutions with the necessary legal powers to implement those goals.
These legal powers include the ability to enact legislation which can directly affect all member states and their inhabitants.
"The Court of Justice primarily deals with cases taken by member states, the institutions, and cases referred to it by the courts of member states."
"Because of the doctrines of direct effect and supremacy, many judgments of the Court of Justice are automatically applicable within the internal legal orders of the member states."
"The General Court mainly deals with cases taken by individuals and companies directly before the EU's courts, and the European Union Civil Service Tribunal adjudicates in disputes between the European Union and its civil service."
Decisions from the General Court can be appealed to the Court of Justice but only on a point of law.
"""In 2009, the Lisbon Treaty gave legal effect to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union."
The charter is a codified catalogue of fundamental rights against which the EU's legal acts can be judged.
"It consolidates many rights which were previously recognised by the Court of Justice and derived from the ""constitutional traditions common to the member states."""
"The Court of Justice has long recognised fundamental rights and has, on occasion, invalidated EU legislation based on its failure to adhere to those fundamental rights."
Signing the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) is a condition for EU membership.
"Previously, the EU itself could not accede to the convention as it is neither a state nor had the competence to accede."
The Lisbon Treaty and Protocol 14 to the ECHR have changed this: the former binds the EU to accede to the convention while the latter formally permits it.
"The EU is independent from the Council of Europe, although they share purpose and ideas,  especially on the rule of law, human rights and democracy."
"Furthermore, the European Convention on Human Rights and European Social Charter, as well as the source of law for the Charter of Fundamental Rights are created by the Council of Europe."
The EU has also promoted human rights issues in the wider world.
The EU opposes the death penalty and has proposed its worldwide abolition.
The new plan was expected to provide the European Union with greater flexibility to target and sanction those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses around the world.
"Regulations become law in all member states the moment they come into force, without the requirement for any implementing measures, and automatically override conflicting domestic provisions."
Directives require member states to achieve a certain result while leaving them discretion as to how to achieve the result.
The details of how they are to be implemented are left to member states.
"When the time limit for implementing directives passes, they may, under certain conditions, have direct effect in national law against member states."
Decisions offer an alternative to the two above modes of legislation.
"They are legal acts which only apply to specified individuals, companies or a particular member state."
"They are most often used in competition law, or on rulings on State Aid, but are also frequently used for procedural or administrative matters within the institutions."
"Regulations, directives, and decisions are of equal legal value and apply without any formal hierarchy."
"The ombudsman is elected by the European Parliament for the length of the Parliament's term, and the position is renewable."
"Any EU citizen or entity may appeal to the ombudsman to investigate an EU institution on the grounds of maladministration (administrative irregularities, unfairness, discrimination, abuse of power, failure to reply, refusal of information or unnecessary delay)."
Emily O'Reilly is the current ombudsman since 2013.
"Accordingly, the Union has legislated in areas such as extradition, family law, asylum law, and criminal justice."
Prohibitions against sexual and nationality discrimination have a long standing in the treaties.
"In more recent years, these have been supplemented by powers to legislate against discrimination based on race, religion, disability, age, and sexual orientation."
The EU also operates the Schengen Information System which provides a common database for police and immigration authorities.
This co-operation had to particularly be developed with the advent of open borders through the Schengen Agreement and the associated cross border crime.
Steps for a more wide-ranging co-ordination in foreign relations began in 1970 with the establishment of European Political Cooperation which created an informal consultation process between member states with the aim of forming common foreign policies.
In 1987 the European Political Cooperation was introduced on a formal basis by the Single European Act.
The CFSP requires unanimity among the member states on the appropriate policy to follow on any particular issue.
"The unanimity and difficult issues treated under the CFSP sometimes lead to disagreements, such as those which occurred over the war in Iraq."
"The coordinator and representative of the CFSP within the EU is the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy who speaks on behalf of the EU in foreign policy and defence matters, and has the task of articulating the positions expressed by the member states on these fields of policy into a common alignment."
"The High Representative heads up the European External Action Service (EEAS), a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 on the occasion of the first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon."
"The perceived benefits of becoming a member of the EU act as an incentive for both political and economic reform in states wishing to fulfil the EU's accession criteria, and are considered an important factor contributing to the reform of European formerly Communist countries."
"The demand of Swiss People’s Party (SPP) was, however, turned down, as the voters rejected SPP’s demand for taking back immigration control."
"To that end, a number of efforts were made to increase the EU's military capability, notably the Helsinki Headline Goal process."
"EU military operations are supported by a number of bodies, including the European Defence Agency, European Union Satellite Centre and the European Union Military Staff."
Frontex is an agency of the EU established to manage the cooperation between national border guards securing its external borders.
"It aims to detect and stop illegal immigration, human trafficking and terrorist infiltration."
In 2015 the European Commission presented its proposal for a new European Border and Coast Guard Agency having a stronger role and mandate along with national authorities for border management.
"In an EU consisting of 27 members, substantial security and defence co-operation is increasingly relying on collaboration among all member states."
The EU's external action financing is divided into 'geographic' instruments and 'thematic' instruments.
"If considered collectively, EU member states are the largest contributor of foreign aid in the world."
"These countries, primarily developing countries, include some who seek to one day become either a member state of the European Union, or more closely integrated with the European Union."
"The EU offers financial assistance to countries within the European Neighbourhood, so long as they meet the strict conditions of government reform, economic reform and other issues surrounding positive transformation."
"This process is normally underpinned by an Action Plan, as agreed by both Brussels and the target country."
International recognition of sustainable development as a key element is growing steadily.
"Its role was recognized in three major UN summits on sustainable development: the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) in Johannesburg, South Africa; and the 2012 UN Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD) in Rio de Janeiro."
"Other key global agreements are the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (United Nations, 2015)."
"The SDGs recognize that all countries must stimulate action in the following key areas - people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership - in order to tackle the global challenges that are crucial for the survival of humanity."
"EU development action is based on the European Consensus on Development, which was endorsed on 20 December 2005 by EU Member States, the council, the European Parliament and the commission."
It is applied from the principles of Capability approach and Rights-based approach to development.
Partnership and cooperation agreements are bilateral agreements with non-member nations.
Internal trade between the member states is aided by the removal of barriers to trade such as tariffs and border controls.
"The European Union represents all its members at the World Trade Organization (WTO), and acts on behalf of member states in any disputes."
The currency union represents 342 million EU citizens.
There is a significant variation in Nominal GDP per capita within individual EU states.
"The difference between the richest and poorest regions (281 NUTS-2 regions of the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics) ranged, in 2017, from 31% (Severozapaden, Bulgaria) of the EU28 average (€30,000) to 253% (Luxembourg), or from €4,600 to €92,600."
"The single market involves the free circulation of goods, capital, people, and services within the EU, and the customs union involves the application of a common external tariff on all goods entering the market."
"Once goods have been admitted into the market they cannot be subjected to customs duties, discriminatory taxes or import quotas, as they travel internally."
"The non-EU member states of Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein and Switzerland participate in the single market but not in the customs union."
Until the drive towards economic and monetary union the development of the capital provisions had been slow.
Post-Maastricht there has been a rapidly developing corpus of ECJ judgements regarding this initially neglected freedom.
The free movement of capital is unique insofar as it is granted equally to non-member states.
"The free movement of persons means that EU citizens can move freely between member states to live, work, study or retire in another country."
"While services account for 60–70% of GDP, legislation in the area is not as developed as in other areas."
This lacuna has been addressed by the recently passed Directive on services in the internal market which aims to liberalise the cross border provision of services.
According to the Treaty the provision of services is a residual freedom that only applies if no other freedom is being exercised.
"In 1992, having negotiated the structure and procedures of a currency union, the member states signed the Maastricht Treaty and were legally bound to fulfil the agreed-on rules including the convergence criteria if they wanted to join the monetary union."
The states wanting to participate had first to join the European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
"In 1999 the currency union started, first as an accounting currency with eleven member states joining."
"In 2002, the currency was fully put into place, when euro notes and coins were issued and national currencies began to phase out in the eurozone, which by then consisted of 12 member states."
The eurozone (constituted by the EU member states which have adopted the euro) has since grown to 19 countries.
"The euro, and the monetary policies of those who have adopted it in agreement with the EU, are under the control of the European Central Bank (ECB)."
"The ECB is the central bank for the eurozone, and thus controls monetary policy in that area with an agenda to maintain price stability."
"To complement this framework, there is also a European Systemic Risk Board under the responsibility of the ECB."
Around 46% of the energy consumed was produced within the member states while 54% was imported.
There is a strong dependence on Russian energy that the EU has been attempting to reduce.
"Projects under TEN include the Channel Tunnel, LGV Est, the Fréjus Rail Tunnel, the Öresund Bridge, the Brenner Base Tunnel and the Strait of Messina Bridge."
The developing European transport policies will increase the pressure on the environment in many regions by the increased transport network.
"In the pre-2004 EU members, the major problem in transport deals with congestion and pollution."
"After the recent enlargement, the new states that joined since 2004 added the problem of solving accessibility to the transport agenda."
The Polish road network was upgraded such as the A4 autostrada.
"Galileo is a proposed Satellite navigation system, to be built by the EU and launched by the European Space Agency (ESA)."
"The Galileo project was launched partly to reduce the EU's dependency on the US-operated Global Positioning System, but also to give more complete global coverage and allow for greater accuracy, given the aged nature of the GPS system."
"The policy has the objectives of increasing agricultural production, providing certainty in food supplies, ensuring a high quality of life for farmers, stabilising markets, and ensuring reasonable prices for consumers."
"It was, until recently, operated by a system of subsidies and market intervention."
These were intervention stores of products bought up by the Community to maintain minimum price levels.
"To dispose of surplus stores, they were often sold on the world market at prices considerably below Community guaranteed prices, or farmers were offered subsidies (amounting to the difference between the Community and world prices) to export their products outside the Community."
"This system has been criticised for under-cutting farmers outside Europe, especially those in the developing world."
"Initially, these reforms included the introduction of set-aside in 1988, where a proportion of farm land was deliberately withdrawn from production, milk quotas and, more recently, the 'de-coupling' (or disassociation) of the money farmers receive from the EU and the amount they produce (by the Fischler reforms in 2004)."
"Agriculture expenditure will move away from subsidy payments linked to specific produce, toward direct payments based on farm size."
This is intended to allow the market to dictate production levels.
"One of these reforms entailed the modification of the EU's sugar regime, which previously divided the sugar market between member states and certain African-Caribbean nations with a privileged relationship with the EU."
"For example, in 2001 the commission for the first time prevented a merger between two companies based in the United States (GE and Honeywell) which had already been approved by their national authority."
"Another high-profile case against Microsoft, resulted in the Commission fining Microsoft over €777 million following nine years of legal action."
To this end it has adopted laws establishing minimum employment and environmental standards.
These included the Working Time Directive and the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.
The EU has also sought to coordinate the social security and health systems of member states to facilitate individuals exercising free movement rights and to ensure they maintain their ability to access social security and health services in other member states.
A European unemployment insurance has been proposed among others by the commissioner of Jobs Nicolas Schmit.
A European Directive about Minimum Wage has also been discussedSince 2019 there is a European Commissioner for Equality; a European Institute for Gender Equality has existed since 2007.
Such regions are primarily located in the states of central and southern Europe.
"Several funds provide emergency aid, support for candidate members to transform their country to conform to the EU's standard (Phare, ISPA, and SAPARD), and support to the Commonwealth of Independent States (TACIS)."
TACIS has now become part of the worldwide EuropeAid programme.
"Demographic transition to a society of aging population, low fertility-rates and depopulation of non-metropolitan regions is tackled within this policies."
"Over the past 50 years, an increasingly dense network of legislation has been created, extending to all areas of environmental protection, including air pollution, water quality, waste management, nature conservation, and the control of chemicals, industrial hazards, and biotechnology."
"In subsequent years, the environment became a formal policy area, with its own policy actors, principles and procedures."
the role of the EU in securing the ratification and coming into force of the Kyoto Protocol despite opposition from the United States.
"This international dimension is reflected in the EU's Sixth Environmental Action Programme, which recognises that its objectives can only be achieved if key international agreements are actively supported and properly implemented both at EU level and worldwide."
The Lisbon Treaty further strengthened the leadership ambitions.
"In 2007, member states agreed that, in the future, 20% of the energy used across the EU must be renewable, and carbon dioxide emissions have to be lower in 2020 by at least 20% compared to 1990 levels."
The EU has adopted an emissions trading system to incorporate carbon emissions into the economy.
"The European Green Capital is an annual award given to cities that focuses on the environment, energy efficiency, and quality of life in urban areas to create smart city."
Almost all member states supported that goal at an EU summit in June 2019.
"In higher education, the policy was developed in the 1980s in programmes supporting exchanges and mobility."
"The most visible of these has been the Erasmus Programme, a university exchange programme which began in 1987."
These programmes are designed to encourage a wider knowledge of other countries and to spread good practices in the education and training fields across the EU.
"Through its support of the Bologna Process, the EU is supporting comparable standards and compatible degrees across Europe."
"Scientific development is facilitated through the EU's Framework Programmes, the first of which started in 1984."
The aims of EU policy in this area are to co-ordinate and stimulate research.
The independent European Research Council allocates EU funds to European or national research projects.
"EU research and technological framework programmes deal in a number of areas, for example energy where the aim is to develop a diverse mix of renewable energy to help the environment and to reduce dependence on imported fuels."
"In general, life expectancy is lower in Eastern Europe than in Western Europe."
The European Capital of Culture programme selects one or more cities in every year to assist the cultural development of that city.
"This followed lobbying by governing organisations such as the International Olympic Committee and FIFA, due to objections over the application of free market principles to sport, which led to an increasing gap between rich and poor clubs."
"The EU does fund a programme for Israeli, Jordanian, Irish, and British football coaches, as part of the Football 4 Peace project."
"Originally designed in 1955 for the Council of Europe, the flag was adopted by the European Communities, the predecessors of the present Union, in 1986."
"The number of stars is invariably twelve, the figure twelve being the symbol of perfection and entirety."
"The anthem of the Union is an instrumental version of the prelude to the Ode to Joy, the 4th movement of Ludwig van Beethoven's ninth symphony."
The anthem was adopted by European Community leaders in 1985 and has since been played on official occasions.
"Besides naming the continent, the Greek mythological figure of Europa has frequently been employed as a personification of Europe."
"Known from the myth in which Zeus seduces her in the guise of a white bull, Europa has also been referred to in relation to the present Union."
Statues of Europa and the bull decorate several of the Union's institutions and a portrait of her is seen on the 2013 series of Euro banknotes.
The commission has named one of its central buildings in Brussels after Charlemagne and the city of Aachen has since 1949 awarded the Charlemagne Prize to champions of European unification.
ARTE is a public Franco-German TV network that promotes programming in the areas of culture and the arts.
"It provides support for the development, promotion and distribution of European works within Europe and beyond."
"Scholar Thomas Risse wrote in 2009, ""there is a consensus in the literature on Eastern Europe that the EU membership perspective had a huge anchoring effects for the new democracies."""
"At the same time, the union provides an external constraint that prevents soft authoritarian regimes from progressing into hard dictatorships."
"On 2 August 1990, the Iraqi Army invaded and occupied Kuwait, which was met with international condemnation and brought immediate economic sanctions against Iraq by members of the UN Security Council."
"An array of nations joined the coalition, forming the largest military alliance since World War II."
"Most of the coalition's military forces were from the US, with Saudi Arabia, the United Kingdom and Egypt as leading contributors, in that order."
This was followed by a ground assault on 24 February.
"This was a decisive victory for the coalition forces, who liberated Kuwait and advanced into Iraqi territory."
The coalition ceased its advance and declared a ceasefire 100 hours after the ground campaign started.
"Aerial and ground combat was confined to Iraq, Kuwait, and areas on Saudi Arabia's border."
Iraq launched Scud missiles against Israel and coalition targets in Saudi Arabia.
The US was concerned with Iraq's position on Israeli–Palestinian politics.
"The US also disliked Iraqi support for many Arab and Palestinian militant groups such as Abu Nidal, which led to Iraq's inclusion on the developing US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism on 29 December 1979."
"In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of State Sponsors of Terrorism."
The real reason was to help them succeed in the war against Iran.
"""With Iraq's newfound success in the war, and the Iranian rebuff of a peace offer in July, arms sales to Iraq reached a record spike in 1982."
"When Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expelled Abu Nidal to Syria at the US's request in November 1983, the Reagan administration sent Donald Rumsfeld to meet Saddam as a special envoy and to cultivate ties."
"By the time the ceasefire with Iran was signed in August 1988, Iraq was heavily debt-ridden and tensions within society were rising."
Most of its debt was owed to Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.
"Iraq pressured both nations to forgive the debts, but they refused."
The Iraq–Kuwait dispute also involved Iraqi claims to Kuwaiti territory.
"Kuwait had been a part of the Ottoman Empire's province of Basra, something that Iraq claimed made Kuwait rightful Iraqi territory."
"Kuwait's ruling dynasty, the al-Sabah family, had concluded a protectorate agreement in 1899 that assigned responsibility for Kuwait's foreign affairs to the United Kingdom."
The United Arab Emirates and Kuwait were consistently overproducing; the latter at least in part to repair losses caused by Iranian attacks in the Iran–Iraq War and to pay for the losses of an economic scandal.
"Resulting revenues struggled to support the government's basic costs, let alone repair Iraq's damaged infrastructure."
"Jordan and Iraq both looked for more discipline, with little success."
"The Iraqi government described it as a form of economic warfare, which it claimed was aggravated by Kuwait slant-drilling across the border into Iraq's Rumaila oil field."
"At the same time, Saddam looked for closer ties with those Arab states that had supported Iraq in the war."
"A pact of non-interference and non-aggression was signed between the countries, followed by a Kuwaiti-Iraqi deal for Iraq to supply Kuwait with water for drinking and irrigation, although a request for Kuwait to lease Iraq Umm Qasr was rejected."
"Saudi-backed development projects were hampered by Iraq's large debts, even with the demobilization of 200,000 soldiers."
These events drew little notice outside the Arab world because of fast-moving events directly related to the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe.
"However, the US did begin to condemn Iraq's human rights record, including the well-known use of torture."
"The UK also condemned the execution of Farzad Bazoft, a journalist working for the British newspaper The Observer."
"Following Saddam's declaration that ""binary chemical weapons"" would be used on Israel if it used military force against Iraq, Washington halted part of its funding."
"On the 23rd, the CIA reported that Iraq had moved 30,000 troops to the Iraq-Kuwait border, and the US naval fleet in the Persian Gulf was placed on alert."
"Saddam believed an anti-Iraq conspiracy was developing – Kuwait had begun talks with Iran, and Iraq's rival Syria had arranged a visit to Egypt."
"Upon review by the Secretary of Defense, it was found that Syria indeed planned a strike against Iraq in the coming days."
Saddam immediately used funding to incorporate central intelligence into Syria and ultimately prevented the impending air strike.
The US sent aerial refuelling planes and combat ships to the Persian Gulf in response to these threats.
We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country.
"Frankly, we can only see that you have deployed massive troops in the south."
Normally that would not be any of our business.
"But when this happens in the context of what you said on your national day, then when we read the details in the two letters of the Foreign Minister, then when we see the Iraqi point of view that the measures taken by the UAE and Kuwait is, in the final analysis, parallel to military aggression against Iraq, then it would be reasonable for me to be concerned."
"Saddam stated that he would attempt last-ditch negotiations with the Kuwaitis but Iraq ""would not accept death."
Glaspie similarly believed that war was not imminent.
"The Iraqi response was to immediately order an invasion, which started on 2 August 1990 with the bombing of Kuwait's capital, Kuwait City."
"Before the invasion, the Kuwaiti military was believed to have numbered 16,000 men, arranged into three armored, one mechanised infantry and one under-strength artillery brigade."
"The pre-war strength of the Kuwait Air Force was around 2,200 Kuwaiti personnel, with 80 fixed-wing aircraft and 40 helicopters."
"In spite of Iraqi saber rattling, Kuwait did not mobilize its force; the army had been stood-down on 19 July, and during the Iraqi invasion many Kuwaiti military personnel were on leave."
"By 1988, at the end of the Iran–Iraq war, the Iraqi Army was the world's fourth largest army, consisting of 955,000 standing soldiers and 650,000 paramilitary forces in the Popular Army."
"According to John Childs and André Corvisier, a low estimate shows the Iraqi Army capable of fielding 4,500 tanks, 484 combat aircraft and 232 combat helicopters."
"The Iraqi attack had two prongs, with the primary attack force driving south straight for Kuwait City down the main highway, and a supporting attack force entering Kuwait farther west, but then turning and driving east, cutting off Kuwait City from the country's southern half."
A few combat sorties were flown against Iraqi ground forces.
"The main Iraqi thrust into Kuwait City was conducted by commandos deployed by helicopters and boats to attack the city from the sea, while other divisions seized the airports and two airbases."
"The Iraqis attacked the Dasman Palace, the Royal Residence of Kuwait's Emir, Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, which was defended by the Emiri Guard supported with M-84 tanks."
"In the process, the Iraqis killed Fahad Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, the Emir's youngest brother."
"Within 12 hours, most resistance had ended within Kuwait, and the royal family had fled, allowing Iraq to control most of Kuwait."
"After two days of intense combat, most of the Kuwaiti military were either overrun by the Iraqi Republican Guard, or had escaped to Saudi Arabia."
The Emir and key ministers fled south along the highway for refuge in Saudi Arabia.
"Iraqi ground forces consolidated their control of Kuwait City, then headed south and redeployed along the Saudi border."
"After the decisive Iraqi victory, Saddam initially installed a puppet regime known as the ""Provisional Government of Free Kuwait"" before installing his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid as Kuwait's governor on 8 August."
"After the invasion, the Iraqi military looted over $1,000,000,000 in banknotes from Kuwait's Central Bank."
"At the same time, Saddam Hussein made the Kuwaiti dinar equal to the Iraqi dinar, thereby lowering the Kuwaiti currency to one-twelfth of its original value."
"In response, Sheikh Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah ruled the banknotes as invalid and refused to reimburse stolen notes, which became worthless because of a UN embargo."
"After the conflict ended, many of the stolen banknotes made their way back into circulation."
"Today, the stolen banknotes are a collectible for numismatists."
The Kuwaiti resistance's casualty rate far exceeded that of the coalition military forces and Western hostages.
The resistance predominantly consisted of ordinary citizens who lacked any form of training and supervision.
"The Iran–Iraq war had been going on for five years by that time and both sides sustained significant casualties, reaching into the hundreds of thousands."
Within President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council concern was growing that the war could spread beyond the boundaries of the two belligerents.
"A National Security Planning Group meeting was formed, chaired by then Vice President George Bush, to review US options."
"It was determined that the conflict would likely spread into Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states, but that the United States had little capability to defend the region."
"Furthermore, it was determined that a prolonged war in the region would induce much higher oil prices and threaten the fragile recovery of the world economy, which was just beginning to gain momentum."
"On 22 May 1984, President Reagan was briefed on the project conclusions in the Oval Office by William Flynn Martin who had served as the head of the NSC staff that organized the study."
"(The full declassified presentation can be seen here:) The conclusions were threefold: first, oil stocks needed to be increased among members of the International Energy Agency and, if necessary, released early if the oil market was disrupted; second, the United States needed to beef up the security of friendly Arab states in the region; and third, an embargo should be placed on sales of military equipment to Iran and Iraq."
"The plan was approved by President Reagan and later affirmed by the G-7 leaders headed by the United Kingdom's Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, in the London Summit of 1984."
The plan was implemented and became the basis for US preparedness to respond to the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait in 1991.
"Within hours of the invasion, Kuwait and US delegations requested a meeting of the UN Security Council, which passed Resolution 660, condemning the invasion and demanding a withdrawal of Iraqi troops."
"On 3 August 1990, the Arab League passed its own resolution, which called for a solution to the conflict from within the league, and warned against outside intervention."
Iraq and Libya were the only two Arab League states that opposed the resolution for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait; the PLO opposed it as well.
The Arab states of Yemen and Jordan – a Western ally which bordered Iraq and relied on the country for economic support – opposed military intervention from non-Arab states.
"Resolution 665 followed soon after, which authorized a naval blockade to enforce the sanctions."
"Specifically, he called for Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in Palestine, Syria, and Lebanon, Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and ""mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait."""
"He also called for a replacement of US troops that mobilized in Saudi Arabia in response to Kuwait's invasion with ""an Arab force"", as long as that force did not involve Egypt."
"Additionally, he requested an ""immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions"" and a general normalization of relations with Iraq."
"In the video, he asks a young British boy, Stuart Lockwood, whether he is getting his milk, and goes on to say, through his interpreter, ""We hope your presence as guests here will not be for too long."
"Your presence here, and in other places, is meant to prevent the scourge of war."
"""Another Iraqi proposal communicated in August 1990 was delivered to US National Security Advisor Brent Scowcroft by an unidentified Iraqi official."
"The official communicated to the White House that Iraq would ""withdraw from Kuwait and allow foreigners to leave"" provided that the UN lifted sanctions, allowed ""guaranteed access to the Persian Gulf through the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warbah"", and allowed Iraq to ""gain full control of the Rumaila oil field that extends slightly into Kuwaiti territory""."
"The proposal also ""include[d] offers to negotiate an oil agreement with the United States 'satisfactory to both nations' national security interests,' develop a joint plan 'to alleviate Iraq's economical and financial problems' and 'jointly work on the stability of the gulf."
"'""On 29 November 1990, the Security Council passed Resolution 678, which gave Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait, and empowered states to use ""all necessary means"" to force Iraq out of Kuwait after the deadline."
"In December 1990, Iraq made a proposal to withdraw from Kuwait provided that foreign troops left the region and that an agreement was reached regarding the Palestinian problem and the dismantlement of both Israel's and Iraq's weapons of mass destruction."
The White House rejected the proposal.
"The French proposal was supported by Belgium (at the moment one of the rotating Council members), Germany, Spain, Italy, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and several non-aligned nations."
"The US, the UK, and the Soviet Union rejected it; US Ambassador to the UN Thomas Pickering stated that the French proposal was unacceptable, because it went beyond previous Council resolutions on the Iraqi invasion."
"France dropped this proposal when it found ""no tangible sign of interest"" from Baghdad."
"Following Kuwait's conquest, the Iraqi Army was within easy striking distance of Saudi oil fields."
"Control of these fields, along with Kuwaiti and Iraqi reserves, would have given Saddam control over the majority of the world's oil reserves."
Iraq also had a number of grievances with Saudi Arabia.
The Saudis had lent Iraq some 26 billion dollars during its war with Iran.
"The Saudis had backed Iraq in that war, as they feared the influence of Shia Iran's Islamic revolution on its own Shia minority."
"After the war, Saddam felt he should not have to repay the loans due to the help he had given the Saudis by fighting Iran."
"Soon after his conquest of Kuwait, Saddam began verbally attacking the Saudis."
He argued that the US-supported Saudi state was an illegitimate and unworthy guardian of the holy cities of Mecca and Medina.
He combined the language of the Islamist groups that had recently fought in Afghanistan with the rhetoric Iran had long used to attack the Saudis.
The US also sent the battleships USS Missouri and USS Wisconsin to the region.
"Two Air National Guard units were stationed at Al Kharj Air Base, the South Carolina Air National Guard's 169th Fighter Wing flew bombing missions with 24 F-16s flying 2,000 combat missions and dropping four million pounds (1,800,000 kilograms; 1,800 metric tons) of munitions, and the New York Air National Guard's 174th Fighter Wing from Syracuse flew 24 F-16s on bombing missions."
"Military buildup continued from there, eventually reaching 543,000 troops, twice the number used in the 2003 invasion of Iraq."
"Much of the material was airlifted or carried to the staging areas via fast sealift ships, allowing a quick buildup."
"The first stop was Saudi Arabia, which a month before had already granted permission to the United States to use its facilities."
"However, Baker believed that Saudi Arabia should assume some of the cost of the military efforts to defend it."
"Baker then moved to enter talks with Egypt, whose leadership he considered ""the moderate voice of the Middle East""."
"President Mubarak of Egypt was furious with Saddam for his invasion of Kuwait, and for the fact that Saddam had assured Mubarak that an invasion was not his intention."
"Assad had a deep personal enmity towards Saddam, which was defined by the fact that ""Saddam had been trying to kill him [Assad] for years."""
"Harboring this animosity and impressed with Baker's diplomatic initiative to visit Damascus (relations had been severed since the 1983 bombing of US Marine barracks in Beirut), Assad agreed to pledge up to 100,000 Syrian troops to the coalition effort."
This was a vital step in ensuring Arab states were represented in the coalition.
"In exchange, Washington gave Syrian dictator President Hafez al-Assad the green light to wipe out forces opposing Syria's rule in Lebanon and arranged for weapons valued at a billion dollars to be provided to Syria, mostly through Gulf states."
"In exchange for Iran's support for the US-led intervention, the US government promised the Iranian government to end US opposition to World Bank loans to Iran."
"Although Germany's constitution (which was brokered essentially by the United States) prohibited military involvement in outside nations, Kohl committed a two billion dollar contribution to the coalition's war effort, as well as further economic and military support of coalition ally Turkey, and the transportation of Egyptian soldiers and ships to the Persian Gulf."
"A coalition of forces opposing Iraq's aggression was formed, consisting of forces from 39 countries: Afghanistan, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Canada, Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Greece, Honduras, Hungary, Italy, Kuwait, Morocco, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Niger, Norway, Oman, Pakistan, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sierra Leone, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Syria, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and the United States."
It was the largest coalition since World War II.
Some felt that the war was an internal Arab affair or did not want to increase US influence in the Middle East.
"In the end, however, many nations were persuaded by Iraq's belligerence towards other Arab states, offers of economic aid or debt forgiveness, and threats to withhold aid."
"In addition, the US moved to support its ally Saudi Arabia, whose importance in the region, and as a key supplier of oil, made it of considerable geopolitical importance."
"Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, US Defense Secretary Dick Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where King Fahd requested US military assistance."
"During a speech in a special joint session of the US Congress given on 11 September 1990, US President George Bush summed up the reasons with the following remarks: ""Within three days, 120,000 Iraqi troops with 850 tanks had poured into Kuwait and moved south to threaten Saudi Arabia."
It was then that I decided to act to check that aggression.
"""The Pentagon stated that satellite photos showing a buildup of Iraqi forces along the border were this information's source, but this was later alleged to be false."
"Iraq was also known to possess biological weapons and chemical weapons, which Saddam had used against Iranian troops during the Iran–Iraq War and against his own country's Kurdish population in the Al-Anfal campaign."
"Iraq was also known to have a nuclear weapons program, but the report about it from January 1991 was partially declassified by the CIA on 26 May 2001."
"Shortly after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the organization Citizens for a Free Kuwait was formed in the US."
The Senate supported the military actions in a 52–47 vote.
"However, a year after the war, this allegation was revealed to be a fabrication."
The young woman who had testified was found to be a member of Kuwait's Royal Family and the daughter of Kuwait's ambassador to the US.
She hadn't lived in Kuwait during the Iraqi invasion.
"This prompted a reexamination by Amnesty International, which had originally promoted an account alleging even greater numbers of babies torn from incubators than the original fake testimony."
"After finding no evidence to support it, the organization issued a retraction."
President Bush then repeated the incubator allegations on television.
"In reality, the Iraqi Army did commit various well-documented crimes during its occupation of Kuwait, such as the summary execution without trial of three brothers, after which their bodies were stacked and left to decay in a public street."
Iraqi troops also ransacked and looted private Kuwaiti homes; one residence was repeatedly defecated in.
"For 42 consecutive days and nights, the coalition forces subjected Iraq to one of the most intensive air bombardments in military history."
"The air campaign was commanded by USAF Lieutenant General Chuck Horner, who briefly served as US Central Command's Commander-in-Chief – Forward while General Schwarzkopf was still in the US."
The priority was the destruction of Iraq's Air Force and anti-aircraft facilities.
The sorties were launched mostly from Saudi Arabia and the six carrier battle groups (CVBG) in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea.
The next targets were command and communication facilities.
"Saddam Hussein had closely micromanaged Iraqi forces in the Iran–Iraq War, and initiative at lower levels was discouraged."
Coalition planners hoped that Iraqi resistance would quickly collapse if deprived of command and control.
"The air campaign's third and largest phase targeted military targets throughout Iraq and Kuwait: Scud missile launchers, weapons research facilities, and naval forces."
"About a third of the coalition's air power was devoted to attacking Scuds, some of which were on trucks and therefore difficult to locate."
US and British special operations forces had been covertly inserted into western Iraq to aid in the search for and destruction of Scuds.
"Iraqi anti-aircraft defenses, including man-portable air-defense systems, were surprisingly ineffective against enemy aircraft, and the coalition suffered only 75 aircraft losses in over 100,000 sorties, 44 due to Iraqi action."
Two of these losses are the result of aircraft colliding with the ground while evading Iraqi ground-fired weapons.
One of these losses is a confirmed air-air victory.
"""Five hours after the first attacks, Iraq's state radio broadcast declared that ""The dawn of victory nears as this great showdown begins."""
Iraq fired eight missiles the next day.
These missile attacks were to continue throughout the war.
Iraq fired 88 Scud missiles during the war's seven weeks.
Iraq hoped to provoke a military response from Israel.
"The Iraqi government hoped that many Arab states would withdraw from the Coalition, as they would be reluctant to fight alongside Israel."
"Following the first attacks, Israeli Air Force jets were deployed to patrol the northern airspace with Iraq."
"Israel prepared to militarily retaliate, as its policy for the previous 40 years had always been retaliation."
"However, President Bush pressured Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir not to retaliate and withdraw Israeli jets, fearing that if Israel attacked Iraq, the other Arab nations would either desert the coalition or join Iraq."
"It was also feared that if Israel used Syrian or Jordanian airspace to attack Iraq, they would intervene in the war on Iraq's side or attack Israel."
"According to the Jewish Virtual Library, Iraqi attacks killed 74 Israelis: two directly and the rest from suffocation and heart attacks."
Approximately 230 Israelis were injured.
"Extensive property damage was also caused, and, according to the Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ""Damage to general property consisted of 1,302 houses, 6,142 apartments, 23 public buildings, 200 shops and 50 cars."""
It was feared that Iraq would fire missiles filled with nerve agents such as sarin.
"As a result, Israel's government issued gas masks to its citizens."
"When the first Iraqi missiles hit Israel, some people injected themselves with an antidote for nerve gas."
"It has been suggested that the sturdy construction techniques used in Israeli cities, coupled with the fact that Scuds were only launched at night, played an important role in limiting the number of casualties from Scud attacks."
"In response to the threat of Scuds on Israel, the US rapidly sent a Patriot missile air defense artillery battalion to Israel along with two batteries of MIM-104 Patriot missiles for the protection of civilians."
The Royal Netherlands Air Force also deployed a Patriot missile squadron to Israel and Turkey.
"The Dutch Defense Ministry later stated that the military use of the Patriot missile system was largely ineffective, but its psychological value for the affected populations was high."
"Coalition air forces were also extensively exercised in ""Scud hunts"" in the Iraqi desert, trying to locate the camouflaged trucks before they fired their missiles at Israel or Saudi Arabia."
"On the ground, special operations forces also infiltrated Iraq, tasked with locating and destroying Scuds - including the ill-fated Bravo Two Zero patrol of the SAS."
"Once special operations were combined with air patrols, the number of attacks fell sharply, then increased slightly as Iraqi forces adjusted to coalition tactics."
"As the Scud attacks continued, the Israelis grew increasingly impatient, and considered taking unilateral military action against Iraq."
"On 22 January 1991, a Scud missile hit the Israeli city of Ramat Gan, after two coalition Patriots failed to intercept it."
"Three elderly people suffered fatal heart attacks, another 96 people were injured, and 20 apartment buildings were damaged."
"After this attack, the Israelis warned that if the US failed to stop the attacks, they would."
The missiles were fired at both military and civilian targets.
"One Saudi civilian was killed, and 78 others were injured."
No casualties were reported in Bahrain or Qatar.
The Saudi government issued all its citizens and expatriates with gas masks in the event of Iraq using missiles with chemical or biological warheads.
The government broadcast alerts and 'all clear' messages over television to warn citizens during Scud attacks.
"The Battle of Khafji ended two days later when the Iraqis were driven back by the Saudi Arabian National Guard, supported by Qatari forces and US Marines."
The allied forces used extensive artillery fire.
"Both sides suffered casualties, although Iraqi forces sustained substantially more dead and captured than the allied forces."
"Eleven Americans were killed in two separate friendly fire incidents, an additional 14 US airmen were killed when their AC-130 gunship was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile, and two US soldiers were captured during the battle."
Saudi and Qatari forces had a total of 18 dead.
The Battle of Khafji was an example of how air power could single-handedly hinder the advance of enemy ground forces.
Precision stand-off attacks were conducted during the night and through to the next day.
"Some crews simply abandoned their vehicles upon realizing that they could be destroyed by guided bombs, stopping the divisions from massing for an organized attack on the town."
"One Iraqi soldier, who had fought in the Iran–Iraq War, remarked that his brigade ""had sustained more punishment from allied airpower in 30 minutes at Khafji than in eight years of fighting against Iran."""
"It was the spearhead of VII Corps, consisting primarily of the 1st Battalion, 41st Infantry Regiment, 3rd Battalion, 66th Armor Regiment, and the 4th Battalion, 3rd Field Artillery Regiment."
"Task Force 1–41 was the first coalition force to breach the Saudi Arabian border on 15 February 1991, and to conduct ground combat operations in Iraq engaging in direct and indirect fire fights with the enemy on 17 February 1991."
Shortly after arrival in theatre Task Force 1–41 Infantry received a counter-reconnaissance mission.
"1–41 Infantry was assisted by the 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment."
This joint effort would become known as Task Force Iron.
Counter-reconnaissance generally includes destroying or repelling the enemy's reconnaissance elements and denying their commander any observation of friendly forces.
On 15 February 1991 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment fired on a trailer and a few trucks in the Iraqi sector observing American forces.
On 16 February 1991 several groups of Iraqi vehicles appeared to be performing reconnaissance on the Task Force and were driven away by fire from 4–3 FA.
"Another enemy platoon, including six vehicles, was reported as being to the northeast of the Task Force."
Later that evening another group of Iraqi vehicles was spotted moving towards the center of the Task Force.
They appeared to be Iraqi Soviet-made BTRs and tanks.
For the next hour the Task Force fought several small battles with Iraqi reconnaissance units.
Later that evening the Task Force received enemy artillery fire but suffered no casualties.
"Prior to this action the Task Force's primary fire support battalion, 4th Battalion of the 3rd Field Artillery Regiment, participated in a massive artillery preparation."
Around 300 guns from multiple nations participated in the artillery barrage.
"Over 14,000 rounds were fired during these missions."
"M270 Multiple Launch Rocket Systems contributed an additional 4,900 rockets fired at Iraqi targets."
One Iraqi unit that was totally destroyed during the preparation was the Iraqi 48th Infantry Division Artillery Group.
This artillery prep was supplemented by air attacks by B-52 bombers and Lockheed AC-130 fixed wing gunships.
"One artillery mission struck a series of Iraqi bunkers, reinforced by Iraqi T-55 tanks, in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division."
"The same day the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division with the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry, 1st Battalion, 32nd Armor, and the 1st Battalion, 8th Cavalry destroyed Iraqi bunkers and combat vehicles in the sector of the Iraqi 25th Infantry Division."
"On 24 February 2nd Brigade, 1st Infantry Division rolled through the breach in the Iraqi defense west of Wadi Al-Batin and also cleared the northeastern sector of the breach site of enemy resistance."
Also on 24 February the 1st Infantry Division along with the 1st Cavalry Division destroyed Iraqi outposts and patrols belonging to the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division.
The two divisions also began capturing prisoners.
The 1st Infantry Division cleared a zone between Phase Line Vermont and Phase Line Kansas.
"The 1st Squadron, 4th Armored Cavalry Regiment handled similar responsibilities in its sector of operations."
"The 1st Infantry Division's 5th Battalion, 16th Infantry also played a significant role clearing the trenches and captured 160 Iraqi soldiers in the process."
Once into Iraqi territory Task Force 1-41 Infantry encountered multiple Iraqi defensive positions and bunkers.
These defensive positions were occupied by a brigade-sized element.
Task Force 1-41 Infantry elements dismounted and prepared to engage the enemy soldiers who occupied these well-prepared and heavily fortified bunkers.
The Task Force found itself engaged in six hours of combat in order to clear the extensive bunker complex.
"The Iraqis engaged the Task Force with small arms fire, RPGs, mortar fire, and what was left of Iraqi artillery assets."
A series of battles unfolded resulting in heavy Iraqi casualties and the Iraqis being removed from their defensive positions with many becoming prisoners of war.
Some escaped to be killed or captured by other coalition forces.
"In the process of clearing the bunkers, Task Force 1-41 captured two brigade command posts and the command post of the Iraqi 26th Infantry Division."
"The Task Force also captured a brigade commander, several battalion commanders, company commanders, and staff officers."
"The battles at 73 Easting, Norfolk, and Medina Ridge are well noted for their historic significance."
Some consider the battle of Medina Ridge the largest tank battle of the war.
The US Marine Corps also fought the biggest tank battle in its history at Kuwait International Airport.
The US 3rd Armored Division also fought a significant battle at Objective Dorset not far from where the battle of Norfolk was taking place.
The US 3rd Armored Division destroyed approximately 300 enemy combat vehicles during this particular encounter with Iraqi forces.
"The Iraqis suffered the loss of over 3,000 tanks and over 2,000 other combat vehicles during these battles against the American-led coalition."
"For months, American units in Saudi Arabia had been under almost constant Iraqi artillery fire, as well as threats from Scud missiles and chemical attacks."
"On 24 February 1991, the 1st and 2nd Marine Divisions and the 1st Light Armored Infantry Battalion crossed into Kuwait and headed toward Kuwait City."
"They encountered trenches, barbed wire, and minefields."
"However, these positions were poorly defended, and were overrun in the first few hours."
"Several tank battles took place, but otherwise coalition troops encountered minimal resistance, as most Iraqi troops surrendered."
The general pattern was that the Iraqis would put up a short fight before surrendering.
"However, Iraqi air defenses shot down nine US aircraft."
"It was decided to send British armored forces into Kuwait 15 hours ahead of schedule, and to send US forces after the Republican Guard."
"The coalition advance was preceded by a heavy artillery and rocket barrage, after which 150,000 troops and 1,500 tanks began their advance."
"Iraqi forces in Kuwait counterattacked against US troops, acting on a direct order from Saddam Hussein himself."
Iraqi troops offered only light resistance.
The Kuwaitis quickly liberated the city despite losing one soldier and having one plane shot down.
"On 27 February, Saddam ordered a retreat from Kuwait, and President Bush declared it liberated."
"However, an Iraqi unit at Kuwait International Airport appeared not to have received the message and fiercely resisted."
"US Marines had to fight for hours before securing the airport, after which Kuwait was declared secure."
"After four days of fighting, Iraqi forces were expelled from Kuwait."
"As part of a scorched earth policy, they set fire to nearly 700 oil wells and placed land mines around the wells to make extinguishing the fires more difficult."
"The first units to move into Iraq were three patrols of the British Special Air Service's B squadron, call signs Bravo One Zero, Bravo Two Zero, and Bravo Three Zero, in late January."
"These eight-man patrols landed behind Iraqi lines to gather intelligence on the movements of Scud mobile missile launchers, which could not be detected from the air, as they were hidden under bridges and camouflage netting during the day."
Other objectives included the destruction of the launchers and their fiber-optic communications arrays that lay in pipelines and relayed coordinates to the TEL operators launching attacks against Israel.
The operations were designed to prevent any possible Israeli intervention.
"Due to lack of sufficient ground cover to carry out their assignment, One Zero and Three Zero abandoned their operations, while Two Zero remained, and was later compromised, with only Sergeant Chris Ryan escaping to Syria."
"Elements of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Battalion 5th Cavalry of the 1st Cavalry Division of the US Army performed a direct attack into Iraq on 15 February 1991, followed by one in force on 20 February that led directly through seven Iraqi divisions which were caught off guard."
"It was a feint attack, designed to make the Iraqis think that a coalition invasion would take place from the south."
"The Iraqis fiercely resisted, and the Americans eventually withdrew as planned back into the Wadi Al-Batin."
"Three US soldiers were killed and nine wounded, with one M2 Bradley IFV turret destroyed, but they had taken 40 prisoners and destroyed five tanks, and successfully deceived the Iraqis."
This attack led the way for the XVIII Airborne Corps to sweep around behind the 1st Cav and attack Iraqi forces to the west.
"On 22 February 1991, Iraq agreed to a Soviet-proposed ceasefire agreement."
"The agreement called for Iraq to withdraw troops to pre-invasion positions within six weeks following a total ceasefire, and called for monitoring of the ceasefire and withdrawal to be overseen by the UN Security Council."
"The coalition rejected the proposal, but said that retreating Iraqi forces would not be attacked, and gave 24 hours for Iraq to withdraw its forces."
"Iraqi resistance was light, and four Americans were killed."
"Simultaneously, the US XVIII Airborne Corps launched a sweeping ""left-hook"" attack across southern Iraq's largely undefended desert, led by the US 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment and the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized)."
This movement's left flank was protected by the French Division Daguet.
The 101st Airborne Division conducted a combat air assault into enemy territory.
The 101st Airborne Division had struck 249 km (155 mi) behind enemy lines.
It was the deepest air assault operation in history.
"Approximately 400 helicopters transported 2,000 soldiers into Iraq where they destroyed Iraqi columns trying to flee westward and prevented the escape of Iraqi forces."
The 101st Airborne Division travelled a further 80 to 100 km (50 to 60 mi) into Iraq.
"By nightfall, the 101st cut off Highway 8 which was a vital supply line running between Basra and the Iraqi forces."
The 101st had lost 16 soldiers in action during the 100-hour war and captured thousands of enemy prisoners of war.
"The French force quickly overcame Iraq's 45th Infantry Division, suffering light casualties and taking a large number of prisoners, and took up blocking positions to prevent an Iraqi counterattack on the coalition's flank."
The movement's right flank was protected by the United Kingdom's 1st Armoured Division.
"Once the allies had penetrated deep into Iraqi territory, they turned eastward, launching a flank attack against the elite Republican Guard before it could escape."
"The Iraqis resisted fiercely from dug-in positions and stationary vehicles, and even mounted armored charges."
"Unlike many previous engagements, the destruction of the first Iraqi tanks did not result in a mass surrender."
"The Iraqis suffered massive losses and lost dozens of tanks and vehicles, while US casualties were comparatively low, with a single Bradley knocked out."
"Coalition forces pressed another 10 km into Iraqi territory, and captured their objective within three hours."
"A US soldier was killed by an Iraqi land mine, another five by friendly fire, and 30 wounded during the battle."
"Meanwhile, British forces attacked Iraq's Medina Division and a major Republican Guard logistics base."
"In nearly two days of some of the war's most intense fighting, the British destroyed 40 enemy tanks and captured a division commander."
"Meanwhile, US forces attacked the village of Al Busayyah, meeting fierce resistance."
"The US force destroyed military hardware and took prisoners, while suffering no casualties."
"Although they were retreating, this convoy was bombed so extensively by coalition air forces that it came to be known as the Highway of Death."
Thousands of Iraqi troops were killed.
"At the conference, Iraq was authorized to fly armed helicopters on their side of the temporary border, ostensibly for government transit due to the damage done to civilian infrastructure."
"Soon after, these helicopters and much of Iraq's military were used to fight an uprising in the south."
"The rebellions were encouraged by an airing of ""The Voice of Free Iraq"" on 2 February 1991, which was broadcast from a CIA-run radio station out of Saudi Arabia."
"However, when no US support came, Iraqi generals remained loyal to Saddam and brutally crushed the Kurdish uprising."
Millions of Kurds fled across the mountains to Turkey and Kurdish areas of Iran.
These events later resulted in no-fly zones being established in northern and southern Iraq.
"In Kuwait, the Emir was restored, and suspected Iraqi collaborators were repressed."
We would not have been able to get everybody out and bring everybody home.
And the final point that I think needs to be made is this question of casualties.
"I don't think you could have done all of that without significant additional US casualties, and while everybody was tremendously impressed with the low cost of the (1991) conflict, for the 146 Americans who were killed in action and for their families, it wasn't a cheap war."
"And the question in my mind is, how many additional American casualties is Saddam [Hussein] worth?"
"And the answer is, not that damned many."
"So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the President made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq."
Kuwaiti democracy advocates had been calling for restoration of Parliament that the Emir had suspended in 1986.
This later became known as checkbook diplomacy.
"In addition, medical teams were deployed aboard a US hospital ship, and a naval clearance diving team took part in de-mining Kuwait's port facilities following the end of combat operations."
Australian forces experienced a number of incidents in the first number of weeks of the Desert Storm Campaign including the detection of significant air threats from Iraq as a part of the outer perimeter of Battle Force Zulu; the detection of free sea floating mines and assistance to the aircraft carrier USS Midway.
"The Australian Task Force was also placed at great risk with regard to the sea mine threat, with HMAS Brisbane narrowly avoiding a mine."
The Australians played a significant role in enforcing the sanctions put in place against Iraq following Kuwait's invasion.
"Following the war's end, Australia deployed a medical unit on Operation Habitat to northern Iraq as part of Operation Provide Comfort."
"In August 1990, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney committed the Canadian Forces to deploy a Naval Task Group."
The destroyers HMCS Terra Nova and HMCS Athabaskan joined the maritime interdiction force supported by the supply ship HMCS Protecteur in Operation Friction.
The Canadian Task Group led the coalition's maritime logistics forces in the Persian Gulf.
"A fourth ship, HMCS Huron, arrived in-theater after hostilities had ceased and was the first allied ship to visit Kuwait."
"Following the UN-authorized use of force against Iraq, the Canadian Forces deployed a CF-18 Hornet and CH-124 Sea King squadron with support personnel, as well as a field hospital to deal with casualties from the ground war."
"When the air war began, the CF-18s were integrated into the coalition force and were tasked with providing air cover and attacking ground targets."
This was the first time since the Korean War that Canada's military had participated in offensive combat operations.
"Operating on the left flank of the US XVIII Airborne Corps, the French Army force was the Division Daguet, including troops from the French Foreign Legion."
"Initially, the French operated independently under national command and control, but coordinated closely with the Americans (via CENTCOM) and Saudis."
"In January, the Division was placed under the tactical control of the XVIII Airborne Corps."
France also deployed several combat aircraft and naval units.
Operation Granby was the code name for the operations in the Persian Gulf.
"British Army regiments (mainly with the 1st Armoured Division), Royal Air Force, Naval Air Squadrons and Royal Navy vessels were mobilized in the Persian Gulf."
"Both Royal Air Force and Naval Air Squadrons, using various aircraft, operated from airbases in Saudi Arabia and Naval Air Squadrons from various vessels in the Persian Gulf."
The United Kingdom played a major role in the Battle of Norfolk where its forces destroyed over 200 Iraqi tanks and a large quantity of other vehicles.
and RFA ships were also deployed.
The light aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea.
Several SAS squadrons were deployed.
The increased importance of air attacks from both coalition warplanes and cruise missiles led to controversy over the number of civilian deaths caused during Desert Storm's initial stages.
"The city was the target of heavy bombing, as it was the seat of power for Saddam and the Iraqi forces' command and control."
This ultimately led to civilian casualties.
"In one noted incident, two USAF stealth planes bombed a bunker in Amiriyah, causing the deaths of 408 Iraqi civilians in the shelter."
"Scenes of burned and mutilated bodies were subsequently broadcast, and controversy arose over the bunker's status, with some stating that it was a civilian shelter, while others contended that it was a center of Iraqi military operations, and that the civilians had been deliberately moved there to act as human shields."
Saddam's government gave high civilian casualty to draw support from Islamic countries.
"""Without electricity, hospitals cannot function, perishable medicines spoil, water cannot be purified and raw sewage cannot be processed,"" the Harvard report said."
"Daponte later raised her estimate of the number of Iraqi deaths caused directly and indirectly by the Gulf War to between 142,500 and 206,000."
"The exact number of Iraqi combat casualties is unknown, but is believed to have been heavy."
This analysis is based on Iraqi prisoner of war reports.
"General Schwarzkopf talked about ""a very, very large number of dead in these units, a very, very large number indeed."""
"The chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Les Aspin, estimated that ""at least 65,000 Iraqi soldiers were killed""."
"A figure was supported by Israeli sources who speak of ""one to two hundred thousand Iraqi casualties."""
A further 145 Americans died in non-combat accidents.
"The UK suffered 47 deaths (nine to friendly fire, all by US forces), France nine, and the other countries, not including Kuwait, suffered 37 deaths (18 Saudis, one Egyptian, six UAE and three Qataris)."
"In all, 190 coalition troops were killed by Iraqi fire during the war, 113 of whom were American, out of 358 coalition deaths."
Another 44 soldiers were killed and 57 wounded by friendly fire.
This number was much lower than expected.
Among the American dead were three female soldiers.
A further 11 died in detonations of coalition munitions.
Nine British military personnel were killed in a friendly fire incident when a USAF A-10 Thunderbolt II destroyed a group of two Warrior IFVs.
"Common symptoms reported are chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, and gastrointestinal disorder."
There has been widespread speculation and disagreement about the causes of the illness and the possibly related birth defects.
Researchers found that infants born to male veterans of the 1991 war had higher rates of two types of heart valve defects.
Some children born after the war to Gulf War veterans had a certain kidney defect that was not found in Gulf War veterans' children born before the war.
"This publication, called the Riegle Report, summarized testimony this committee had received establishing that the US had in the 1980s supplied Saddam Hussein with chemical and biological warfare technology, that Saddam had used such chemical weapons against Iran and his own native Kurds, and possibly against US soldiers as well, plausibly contributing to the Gulf War Syndrome."
"Significant controversy regarding the long term safety of depleted uranium exists, including claims of pyrophoric, genotoxic, and teratogenic heavy metal effects."
"Many have cited its use during the war as a contributing factor to a number of major health issues in veterans and in surrounding civilian populations, including in birth defects and child cancer rates."
Scientific opinion on the risk is mixed.
Some say that depleted uranium is not a significant health hazard unless it is taken into the body.
External exposure to radiation from depleted uranium is generally not a major concern because the alpha particles emitted by its isotopes travel only a few centimeters in air or can be stopped by a sheet of paper.
"Also, the uranium-235 that remains in depleted uranium emits only a small amount of low-energy gamma radiation."
"However, if allowed to enter the body, depleted uranium, like natural uranium, has the potential for both chemical and radiological toxicity with the two important target organs being the kidneys and the lungs."
"A patrolling E-8 Joint STARS aircraft observed the retreating forces and relayed the information to the DDM-8 air operations center in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia."
"These vehicles and the retreating soldiers were subsequently attacked by two A-10 aircraft, resulting in a 60 km stretch of highway strewn with debris—the Highway of Death."
"This event was later called by the media ""The Highway of Death."""
"There were certainly a lot of dead vehicles, but not so many dead Iraqis."
They'd already learned to scamper off into the desert when our aircraft started to attack.
"Nevertheless, some people back home wrongly chose to believe we were cruelly and unusually punishing our already whipped foes."
"This was the ""bulldozer assault"", wherein two brigades from the US 1st Infantry Division (Mechanized) were faced with a large and complex trench network, as part of the heavily fortified ""Saddam Hussein Line""."
"After some deliberation, they opted to use anti-mine plows mounted on tanks and combat earthmovers to simply plow over and bury alive the defending Iraqi soldiers."
Not a single American was killed during the attack.
"Reporters were banned from witnessing the attack, near the neutral zone that touches the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq."
Every American in the assault was inside an armored vehicle.
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney did not mention the First Division's tactics in an interim report to Congress on Operation Desert Storm.
"After the Gulf War, the Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait in 1991."
"Kuwait's policy, which led to this exodus, was a response to alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein."
The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were Jordanian citizens.
"In 2013, 280,000 Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin lived in Kuwait."
"However, the UN subsequently spent billions rebuilding hospitals, schools, and water purification facilities throughout the country."
"Amongst several testimonies to poor treatment, USAF Captain Richard Storr was allegedly tortured by Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War."
"Iraqi secret police broke his nose, dislocated his shoulder and punctured his eardrum."
Royal Air Force Tornado crew John Nichol and John Peters have both alleged that they were tortured during this time.
Nichol and Peters were forced to make statements against the war on television.
Members of British Special Air Service Bravo Two Zero were captured while providing information about an Iraqi supply line of Scud missiles to coalition forces.
"Only one, Chris Ryan, evaded capture while the group's other surviving members were violently tortured."
Flight surgeon (later General) Rhonda Cornum was sexually assaulted by one of her captors after the Black Hawk helicopter in which she was riding was shot down while searching for a downed F-16 pilot.
Operation Southern Watch enforced the no-fly zones over southern Iraq set up after 1991; oil exports through the Persian Gulf's shipping lanes were protected by the Bahrain-based US Fifth Fleet.
"Since Saudi Arabia houses Mecca and Medina, Islam's holiest sites, many Muslims were upset at the permanent military presence."
"The continued presence of US troops in Saudi Arabia after the war was one of the stated motivations behind the 11 September terrorist attacks, the Khobar Towers bombing, and the date chosen for the 1998 US embassy bombings (7 August), which was eight years to the day that US troops were sent to Saudi Arabia."
"Osama bin Laden interpreted the Islamic prophet Muhammad as banning the ""permanent presence of infidels in Arabia""."
"In 1996, bin Laden issued a fatwa, calling for US troops to leave Saudi Arabia."
Studies dispute the number of people who died in south and central Iraq during the years of the sanctions.
"The marshes are typically divided into three main sub-marshes, the Hawizeh, Central, and Hammar Marshes and all three were drained at different times for different reasons."
It was reported as a deliberate natural resources attack to keep US Marines from coming ashore (Missouri and Wisconsin had shelled Failaka Island during the war to reinforce the idea that there would be an amphibious assault attempt).
About 30–40% of this came from allied raids on Iraqi coastal targets.
"Land mines had been placed in areas around the oil wells, and a military cleaning of the areas was necessary before the fires could be put out."
"By that time, however, the fires had burned for approximately 10 months, causing widespread pollution."
"About $52 billion of that amount was paid by other countries: $36 billion by Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Arab states of the Persian Gulf; $16 billion by Germany and Japan (which sent no combat forces due to their constitutions)."
"About 25% of Saudi Arabia's contribution was paid with in-kind services to the troops, such as food and transportation."
The Overseas Development Institute (ODI) undertook a study in 1991 to assess the effects on developing states and the international community's response.
International response to the crisis on developing states came with the channeling of aid through The Gulf Crisis Financial Co-ordination Group.
"They were 24 states, comprising most of the OECD countries plus some Gulf states: Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Kuwait."
The World Bank responded by speeding up the disbursement of existing project and adjustment loans.
The International Monetary Fund adopted two lending facilities – the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and the Compensatory & Contingency Financing Facility (CCFF).
"For the first time, people all over the world watched live pictures of missiles hitting their targets and fighters departing from aircraft carriers."
Allied forces were keen to demonstrate their weapons' accuracy.
"In the United States, the ""big three"" network anchors led the war's network news coverage: ABC's Peter Jennings, CBS's Dan Rather, and NBC's Tom Brokaw were anchoring their evening newscasts when air strikes began on 16 January 1991."
"ABC News correspondent Gary Shepard, reporting live from Baghdad, told Jennings of the city's quietness."
"But, moments later, Shepard returned as flashes of light were seen on the horizon and tracer fire was heard on the ground."
"On CBS, viewers were watching a report from correspondent Allen Pizzey, reporting from Baghdad, when the war began."
"Rather, after the report was finished, announced unconfirmed reports of flashes in Baghdad and heavy air traffic at bases in Saudi Arabia."
"On the NBC Nightly News, correspondent Mike Boettcher reported unusual air activity in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia."
"Moments later, Brokaw announced to his viewers that the air attack had begun."
"Still, it was CNN whose coverage gained the most popularity and indeed its wartime coverage is often cited as one of the landmark events in the network's history, ultimately leading to the establishment of CNN International."
CNN correspondents John Holliman and Peter Arnett and CNN anchor Bernard Shaw relayed audio reports from Baghdad's Al-Rashid Hotel as the air strikes began.
The network had previously convinced the Iraqi government to allow installation of a permanent audio circuit in their makeshift bureau.
"When the telephones of all the other Western TV correspondents went dead during the bombing, CNN was the only service able to provide live reporting."
"After the initial bombing, Arnett remained behind and was, for a time, the only American TV correspondent reporting from Iraq."
"In the United Kingdom, the BBC devoted the FM portion of its national speech radio station BBC Radio 4 to an 18-hour rolling news format creating Radio 4 News FM."
"The station was short lived, ending shortly after President Bush declared the ceasefire and Kuwait's liberation."
"However, it paved the way for the later introduction of Radio Five Live."
"Two BBC journalists, John Simpson and Bob Simpson (no relation), defied their editors and remained in Baghdad to report on the war's progress."
"They were responsible for a report which included an ""infamous cruise missile that travelled down a street and turned left at a traffic light."
"""Newspapers all over the world also covered the war and Time magazine published a special issue dated 28 January 1991, the headline ""War in the Gulf"" emblazoned on the cover over a picture of Baghdad taken as the war began."
US policy regarding media freedom was much more restrictive than in the Vietnam War.
The policy had been spelled out in a Pentagon document entitled Annex Foxtrot.
Most of the press information came from briefings organized by the military.
Only selected journalists were allowed to visit the front lines or conduct interviews with soldiers.
"Those visits were always conducted in the presence of officers, and were subject to both prior approval by the military and censorship afterward."
This was ostensibly to protect sensitive information from being revealed to Iraq.
"This policy was heavily influenced by the military's experience with the Vietnam War, in which public opposition within the US grew throughout the war's course."
"About halfway through the war, Iraq's government decided to allow live satellite transmissions from the country by Western news organizations, and US journalists returned en masse to Baghdad."
"NBC's Tom Aspell, ABC's Bill Blakemore, and CBS News' Betsy Aaron filed reports, subject to acknowledged Iraqi censorship."
"Throughout the war, footage of incoming missiles was broadcast almost immediately."
"A British crew from CBS News, David Green and Andy Thompson, equipped with satellite transmission equipment, traveled with the front line forces and, having transmitted live TV pictures of the fighting en route, arrived the day before the forces in Kuwait City, broadcasting live television from the city and covering the entrance of the Arab forces the next day."
Alternative media outlets provided views opposing the war.
"Deep Dish Television compiled segments from independent producers in the US and abroad, and produced a 10-hour series that was distributed internationally, called The Gulf Crisis TV Project."
"The series' first program War, Oil and Power was compiled and released in 1990, before the war broke out."
"News World Order was the title of another program in the series; it focused on the media's complicity in promoting the war, as well as Americans' reactions to the media coverage."
"In San Francisco, Paper Tiger Television West produced a weekly cable television show with highlights of mass demonstrations, artists' actions, lectures, and protests against mainstream media coverage at newspaper offices and television stations."
Local media outlets in cities across the USA screened similar oppositional media.
"The organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) critically analyzed media coverage during the war in various articles and books, such as the 1991 Gulf War Coverage: The Worst Censorship was at Home."
Some authors have called it the Second Gulf War to distinguish it from the Iran–Iraq War.
Terms in other languages include French: la Guerre du Golfe and German: Golfkrieg (Gulf War); German: Zweiter Golfkrieg (Second Gulf War); French: Guerre du Koweït (War of Kuwait).
"Operation Desert Storm was the US name of the airland conflict from 17 January 1991, through 28 February 1991."
"Operation Desert Sabre (early name Operation Desert Sword) was the US name for the airland offensive against the Iraqi Army in the Kuwaiti Theater of Operations (the ""100-hour war"") from 24 to 28 February 1991, in itself, part of Operation Desert Storm."
"Operation Desert Farewell was the name given to the return of US units and equipment to the US in 1991 after Kuwait's liberation, sometimes referred to as Operation Desert Calm."
Operation Granby was the British name for British military activities during the operations and conflict.
Specific buildings in downtown Baghdad could be bombed while journalists in their hotels watched cruise missiles fly by.
"Other bombs included cluster bombs, which disperse numerous submunitions, and daisy cutters, 15,000-pound bombs which can disintegrate everything within hundreds of yards."
Global Positioning System (GPS) units were relatively new at the time and were important in enabling coalition units to easily navigate across the desert.
"Since military GPS receivers were not available for most troops, many used commercially available units."
Two examples of this are the US Navy's Grumman E-2 Hawkeye and the US Air Force's Boeing E-3 Sentry.
Both were used in command and control area of operations.
"These systems provided essential communications links between air, ground, and naval forces."
It is one of several reasons coalition forces dominated the air war.
American-made color photocopiers were used to produce some of Iraq's battle plans.
"Some of the copiers contained concealed high-tech transmitters that revealed their positions to American electronic warfare aircraft, leading to more precise bombings."
Scud is a tactical ballistic missile that the Soviet Union developed and deployed among the forward deployed Soviet Army divisions in East Germany.
Scud missiles utilize inertial guidance which operates for the duration that the engines operate.
"Iraq used Scud missiles, launching them into both Saudi Arabia and Israel."
"The US military claimed a high effectiveness against Scuds at the time, but later analysis gives figures as low as 9%, with 45% of the 158 Patriot launches being against debris or false targets."
"The Dutch Ministry of Defense, which also sent Patriot missiles to protect civilians in Israel and Turkey, later disputed the higher claim."
"Further, there is at least one incident of a software error causing a Patriot missile's failure to engage an incoming Scud, resulting in deaths."
"Both the US Army and the missile manufacturers maintained the Patriot delivered a ""miracle performance"" in the Gulf War."
"There have also been numerous depictions in film including Jarhead (2005), which is based on US Marine Anthony Swofford's 2003 memoir of the same name."
"The Maya civilization was a Mesoamerican civilization developed by the Maya peoples, and noted for its logosyllabic script—the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system in pre-Columbian Americas—as well as for its art, architecture, mathematics, calendar, and astronomical system."
"The Maya civilization developed in the area that today comprises southeastern Mexico, all of Guatemala and Belize, and the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador."
"It includes the northern lowlands of the Yucatán Peninsula and the highlands of the Sierra Madre, the Mexican state of Chiapas,  southern Guatemala, El Salvador, and the southern lowlands of the Pacific littoral plain."
"“Maya"" is a modern term used to refer collectively to the various peoples that inhabited this area."
"In the Late Preclassic a number of large cities developed in the Petén Basin, and the city of Kaminaljuyu rose to prominence in the Guatemalan Highlands."
This period saw the Maya civilization develop many city-states linked by a complex trade network.
"In the Maya Lowlands two great rivals, the cities of Tikal and Calakmul, became powerful."
The Classic period also saw the intrusive intervention of the central Mexican city of Teotihuacan in Maya dynastic politics.
"In the 9th century, there was a widespread political collapse in the central Maya region, resulting in internecine warfare, the abandonment of cities, and a northward shift of population."
"The Postclassic period saw the rise of Chichen Itza in the north, and the expansion of the aggressive Kʼicheʼ kingdom in the Guatemalan Highlands."
"In the 16th century, the Spanish Empire colonised the Mesoamerican region, and a lengthy series of campaigns saw the fall of Nojpetén, the last Maya city, in 1697."
"Rule during the Classic period centred on the concept of the ""divine king"", who was thought to act as a mediator between mortals and the supernatural realm."
"Kingship was patrilineal, and power normally passed to the eldest son."
A prospective king was expected to be a successful war leader as well as a ruler.
"Closed patronage systems were the dominant force in Maya politics, although how patronage affected the political makeup of a kingdom varied from city-state to city-state."
"By the Late Classic period, the aristocracy had grown in size, reducing the previously exclusive power of the king."
"The Maya developed sophisticated art forms using both perishable and non-perishable materials, including wood, jade, obsidian, ceramics, sculpted stone monuments, stucco, and finely painted murals."
Maya cities tended to expand haphazardly.
"The city centres comprised ceremonial and administrative complexes, surrounded by an irregularly shaped sprawl of residential districts."
Different parts of a city were often linked by causeways.
"Architecturally, city buildings included palaces, pyramid-temples, ceremonial ballcourts, and structures specially aligned for astronomical observation."
"The Maya elite were literate, and developed a complex system of hieroglyphic writing."
Theirs was the most advanced writing system in the pre-Columbian Americas.
"The Maya recorded their history and ritual knowledge in screenfold books, of which only three uncontested examples remain, the rest having been destroyed by the Spanish."
"In addition, a great many examples of Maya texts can be found on stelae and ceramics."
"The Maya developed a highly complex series of interlocking ritual calendars, and employed mathematics that included one of the earliest known instances of the explicit zero in human history."
"As a part of their religion, the Maya practised human sacrifice."
Mesoamerica was one of six cradles of civilization worldwide.
"The Mesoamerican area gave rise to a series of cultural developments that included complex societies, agriculture, cities, monumental architecture, writing, and calendrical systems."
"The diverse climate allowed for wide variation in available crops, but all regions of Mesoamerica cultivated the base crops of maize, beans, and squashes."
"Mesoamerica lacked draft animals, did not use the wheel, and possessed few domesticated animals; the principal means of transport was on foot or by canoe."
Mesoamericans viewed the world as hostile and governed by unpredictable deities.
The ritual Mesoamerican ballgame was widely played.
"Mesoamerica is linguistically diverse, with most languages falling within a small number of language families—the major families are Mayan, Mixe–Zoquean, Otomanguean, and Uto-Aztecan; there are also a number of smaller families and isolates."
"During the Early Classic period, the Maya cities of Tikal and Kaminaljuyu were key Maya foci in a network that extended beyond the Maya area into the highlands of central Mexico."
"At around the same time, there was a strong Maya presence at the Tetitla compound of Teotihuacan."
"Centuries later, during the 9th century AD, murals at Cacaxtla, another site in the central Mexican highlands, were painted in a Maya style."
"This may have been either an effort to align itself with the still-powerful Maya area after the collapse of Teotihuacan and ensuing political fragmentation in the Mexican Highlands, or an attempt to express a distant Maya origin of the inhabitants."
The Maya city of Chichen Itza and the distant Toltec capital of Tula had an especially close relationship.
"This area included the entire Yucatán Peninsula and all of the territory now incorporated into the modern countries of Guatemala and Belize, as well as the western portions of Honduras and El Salvador."
To the south the plain gradually rises towards the Guatemalan Highlands.
"Dense forest covers northern Petén and Belize, most of Quintana Roo, southern Campeche, and a portion of the south of Yucatán state."
"The Maya highlands extend eastwards from Chiapas into Guatemala, reaching their highest in the Sierra de los Cuchumatanes."
"The major pre-Columbian population centres of the highlands were located in the largest highland valleys, such as the Valley of Guatemala and the Quetzaltenango Valley."
"In the southern highlands, a belt of volcanic cones runs parallel to the Pacific coast."
"The highlands extend northwards into Verapaz, and gradually descend to the east."
"These were preceded by the Archaic Period, during which the first settled villages and early developments in agriculture emerged."
"Modern scholars regard these periods as arbitrary divisions of Maya chronology, rather than indicative of cultural evolution or decline."
"Definitions of the start and end dates of period spans can vary by as much as a century, depending on the author."
Scholars continue to discuss when this era of Maya civilization began.
Maya occupation at Cuello (modern-day Belize) has been carbon dated to around 2600 BC.
"Nakbe in the Petén department of Guatemala is the earliest well-documented city in the Maya lowlands, where large structures have been dated to around 750 BC."
The northern lowlands of Yucatán were widely settled by the Middle Preclassic.
A developed script was already being used in Petén by the 3rd century BC.
"Takalik Abaj and Chocolá were two of the most important cities on the Pacific coastal plain, and Komchen grew to become an important site in northern Yucatán."
The Late Preclassic cultural florescence collapsed in the 1st century AD and many of the great Maya cities of the epoch were abandoned; the cause of this collapse is unknown.
"This period marked the peak of large-scale construction and urbanism, the recording of monumental inscriptions, and demonstrated significant intellectual and artistic development, particularly in the southern lowland regions."
"The Classic period Maya political landscape has been likened to that of Renaissance Italy or Classical Greece, with multiple city-states engaged in a complex network of alliances and enmities."
"In AD 378, Teotihuacan decisively intervened at Tikal and other nearby cities, deposed their rulers, and installed a new Teotihuacan-backed dynasty."
"Tikal and Calakmul both developed extensive systems of allies and vassals; lesser cities that entered one of these networks gained prestige from their association with the top-tier city, and maintained peaceful relations with other members of the same network."
Tikal and Calakmul engaged in the manoeuvering of their alliance networks against each other.
"At various points during the Classic period, one or other of these powers would gain a strategic victory over its great rival, resulting in respective periods of florescence and decline."
For the next two decades he fought loyally for his brother and overlord at Tikal.
Yuknoom Chʼeen II then reinstated Balaj Chan Kʼawiil upon the throne of Dos Pilas as his vassal.
The new king had strong ties with central Petén and Teotihuacan.
"Copán reached the height of its cultural and artistic development during the rule of Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil, who ruled from 695 to 738."
"His reign ended catastrophically when he was captured by his vassal, king Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá."
The captured lord of Copán was taken back to Quiriguá and was decapitated in a public ritual.
"It is likely that this coup was backed by Calakmul, in order to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal."
Palenque and Yaxchilan were the most powerful cities in the Usumacinta region.
"In the highlands, Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was already a sprawling city by 300."
"In the north of the Maya area, Coba was the most important capital."
"No universally accepted theory explains this collapse, but it likely had a combination of causes, including endemic internecine warfare, overpopulation resulting in severe environmental degradation, and drought."
"During this period, known as the Terminal Classic, the northern cities of Chichen Itza and Uxmal showed increased activity."
"This model of rulership was poorly structured to respond to changes, because the ruler's actions were limited by tradition to such activities as construction, ritual, and warfare."
This only served to exacerbate systemic problems.
"In the northern Yucatán, individual rule was replaced by a ruling council formed from elite lineages."
"Within a couple of generations, large swathes of the central Maya area were all but abandoned."
Both the capitals and their secondary centres were generally abandoned within a period of 50 to 100 years.
"One by one, cities stopped sculpting dated monuments; the last Long Count date was inscribed at Toniná in 909."
"Stelae were no longer raised, and squatters moved into abandoned royal palaces."
Mesoamerican trade routes shifted and bypassed Petén.
"Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic."
"Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths."
"Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined dramatically in the 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse."
"After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until the rise of the city of Mayapan in the 12th century."
"The once-great city of Kaminaljuyu in the Valley of Guatemala was abandoned after continuous occupation of almost 2,000 years."
"Across the highlands and neighbouring Pacific coast, long-occupied cities in exposed locations were relocated, apparently due to a proliferation of warfare."
"Cities came to occupy more-easily defended hilltop locations surrounded by deep ravines, with ditch-and-wall defences sometimes supplementing the protection provided by the natural terrain."
"One of the most important cities in the Guatemalan Highlands at this time was Qʼumarkaj, the capital of the aggressive Kʼicheʼ kingdom."
"The government of Maya states, from the Yucatán to the Guatemalan highlands, was often organised as joint rule by a council."
"However, in practice one member of the council could act as a supreme ruler, while the other members served him as advisors."
"The abandonment of the city was followed by a period of prolonged warfare, disease and natural disasters in the Yucatán Peninsula, which ended only shortly before Spanish contact in 1511."
"Even without a dominant regional capital, the early Spanish explorers reported wealthy coastal cities and thriving marketplaces."
"During the Late Postclassic, the Yucatán Peninsula was divided into a number of independent provinces that shared a common culture but varied in internal sociopolitical organization."
"On the eve of the Spanish conquest, the highlands of Guatemala were dominated by several powerful Maya states."
The Kʼicheʼ had carved out a small empire covering a large part of the western Guatemalan Highlands and the neighbouring Pacific coastal plain.
"However, in the decades before the Spanish invasion the Kaqchikel kingdom had been steadily eroding the kingdom of the Kʼicheʼ."
"They were seized by a Maya lord, and most were sacrificed, although two managed to escape."
"Shortly afterwards, the Spanish were invited as allies into Iximche, the capital city of the Kaqchikel Maya."
"Good relations did not last, due to excessive Spanish demands for gold as tribute, and the city was abandoned a few months later."
"Francisco de Montejo and his son, Francisco de Montejo the Younger, launched a long series of campaigns against the polities of the Yucatán Peninsula in 1527, and finally completed the conquest of the northern portion of the peninsula in 1546."
This left only the Maya kingdoms of the Petén Basin independent.
"However, many Maya villages remained remote from Spanish colonial authority, and for the most part continued to manage their own affairs."
Maya communities and the nuclear family maintained their traditional day-to-day life.
"The basic Mesoamerican diet of maize and beans continued, although agricultural output was improved by the introduction of steel tools."
"Traditional crafts such as weaving, ceramics, and basketry continued to be practised."
Community markets and trade in local products continued long after the conquest.
"At times, the colonial administration encouraged the traditional economy in order to extract tribute in the form of ceramics or cotton textiles, although these were usually made to European specifications."
"Maya beliefs and language proved resistant to change, despite vigorous efforts by Catholic missionaries."
This was followed by various Spanish priests and colonial officials who left descriptions of ruins they visited in Yucatán and Central America.
"In 1839, American traveller and writer John Lloyd Stephens set out to visit a number of Maya sites with English architect and draftsman Frederick Catherwood."
"Their illustrated accounts of the ruins sparked strong popular interest, and brought the Maya to the attention of the world."
"By the early 20th century, the Peabody Museum was sponsoring excavations at Copán and in the Yucatán Peninsula."
"In the first two decades of the 20th century, advances were made in deciphering the Maya calendar, and identifying deities, dates, and religious concepts."
"Since the 1930s, archaeological exploration increased dramatically, with large-scale excavations across the Maya region."
"These ideas began to collapse with major advances in the decipherment of the script in the late 20th century, pioneered by Heinrich Berlin, Tatiana Proskouriakoff, and Yuri Knorozov."
Multiple domestic constructions used by the population for religious purposes.
"Rather, throughout its history, the Maya area contained a varying mix of political complexity that included both states and chiefdoms."
"These polities fluctuated greatly in their relationships with each other and were engaged in a complex web of rivalries, periods of dominance or submission, vassalage, and alliances."
"At times, different polities achieved regional dominance, such as Calakmul, Caracol, Mayapan, and Tikal."
"The divine king was the centre of political power, exercising ultimate control over the administrative, economic, judicial, and military functions of the polity."
"The divine authority invested within the ruler was such that the king was able to mobilize both the aristocracy and commoners in executing huge infrastructure projects, apparently with no police force or standing army."
"Some polities engaged in a strategy of increasing administration, and filling administrative posts with loyal supporters rather than blood relatives."
"In the Late Classic, some cities established a long period of dominance over other large cities, such as the dominance of Caracol over Naranjo for half a century."
"In other cases, loose alliance networks were formed around a dominant city."
"Border settlements, usually located about halfway between neighbouring capitals, often switched allegiance over the course of their history, and at times acted independently."
Dominant capitals exacted tribute in the form of luxury items from subjugated population centres.
"Political power was reinforced by military power, and the capture and humiliation of enemy warriors played an important part in elite culture."
"An overriding sense of pride and honour among the warrior aristocracy could lead to extended feuds and vendettas, which caused political instability and the fragmentation of polities."
"As population increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialised, and political organization became increasingly complex."
"By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected in a complex web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied."
"A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking priests and officials, merchants, and soldiers."
"Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves."
"According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or clans."
"Such clans held that the land was the property of the clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds."
The king was the supreme ruler and held a semi-divine status that made him the mediator between the mortal realm and that of the gods.
"From very early times, kings were specifically identified with the young maize god, whose gift of maize was the basis of Mesoamerican civilization."
"Maya royal succession was patrilineal, and royal power only passed to queens when doing otherwise would result in the extinction of the dynasty."
"Typically, power was passed to the eldest son."
Various points in the young prince's childhood were marked by ritual; the most important was a bloodletting ceremony at age five or six years.
"Although being of the royal bloodline was of utmost importance, the heir also had to be a successful war leader, as demonstrated by taking of captives."
"Government was hierarchical, and official posts were sponsored by higher-ranking members of the aristocracy; officials tended to be promoted to higher levels of office during the course of their lives."
"Officials are referred to as being ""owned"" by their sponsor, and this relationship continued even after the death of the sponsor."
The Maya royal court was a vibrant and dynamic political institution.
"There was no universal structure for the Maya royal court, instead each polity formed a royal court that was suited to its own individual context."
A number of royal and noble titles have been identified by epigraphers translating Classic Maya inscriptions.
"Ajaw is usually translated as ""lord"" or ""king""."
"In the Early Classic, an ajaw was the ruler of a city."
"Later, with increasing social complexity, the ajaw was a member of the ruling class and a major city could have more than one, each ruling over different districts."
Paramount rulers distinguished themselves from the extended nobility by prefixing the word kʼuhul to their ajaw title.
"A kʼuhul ajaw was ""divine lord"", originally confined to the kings of the most prestigious and ancient royal lines."
"Kalomte was a royal title, whose exact meaning is not yet deciphered, but it was held only by the most powerful kings of the strongest dynasties."
"It indicated an overlord, or high king, and the title was only in use during the Classic period."
"By the Late Classic, the absolute power of the kʼuhul ajaw had weakened, and the political system had diversified to include a wider aristocracy, that by this time may well have expanded disproportionately."
"The ah tzʼihb was a royal scribe, usually a member of the royal family; the ah chʼul hun was the Keeper of the Holy Books, a title that is closely associated with the ajaw title, indicating that an ajaw always held the ah chʼul hun title simultaneously."
"Other courtly titles, the functions of which are not well understood, were yajaw kʼahk' (""Lord of Fire""), tiʼhuun and ti'sakhuun."
"These last two may be variations on the same title, and Mark Zender has suggested that the holder of this title may have been the spokesman for the ruler."
"Courtly titles are overwhelmingly male-oriented, and in those relatively rare occasions where they are applied to a woman, they appear to be used as honorifics for female royalty."
"Titled elites were often associated with particular structures in the hieroglyphic inscriptions of Classic period cities, indicating that such office holders either owned that structure, or that the structure was an important focus for their activities."
A lakam was possibly the only non-elite post-holder in the royal court.
"The kʼuhul ahaw and his household would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers."
"Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction."
Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were played out.
"In such a setting, public performance was vital."
"Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual."
"Their houses were generally constructed from perishable materials, and their remains have left little trace in the archaeological record."
"Some commoner dwellings were raised on low platforms, and these can be identified, but an unknown quantity of commoner houses were not."
Such low-status dwellings can only be detected by extensive remote-sensing surveys of apparently empty terrain.
"The range of commoners was broad; it consisted of everyone not of noble birth, and therefore included everyone from the poorest farmers to wealthy craftsmen and commoners appointed to bureaucratic positions."
"Commoners engaged in essential production activities, including that of products destined for use by the elite, such as cotton and cacao, as well as subsistence crops for their own use, and utilitarian items such as ceramics and stone tools."
"Commoners took part in warfare, and could advance socially by proving themselves as outstanding warriors."
Commoners paid taxes to the elite in the form of staple goods such as maize flour and game.
It is likely that hard-working commoners who displayed exceptional skills and initiative could become influential members of Maya society.
"Military campaigns were launched for a variety of reasons, including the control of trade routes and tribute, raids to take captives, scaling up to the complete destruction of an enemy state."
"Little is known about Maya military organization, logistics, or training."
"Warfare is depicted in Maya art from the Classic period, and wars and victories are mentioned in hieroglyphic inscriptions."
"Unfortunately, the inscriptions do not provide information upon the causes of war, or the form it took."
"In the 8th–9th centuries, intensive warfare resulted in the collapse of the kingdoms of the Petexbatún region of western Petén."
The rapid abandonment of Aguateca by its inhabitants has provided a rare opportunity to examine the remains of Maya weaponry in situ.
"Aguateca was stormed by unknown enemies around 810 AD, who overcame its formidable defences and burned the royal palace."
"The elite inhabitants of the city either fled or were captured, and never returned to collect their abandoned property."
The inhabitants of the periphery abandoned the site soon after.
"This is an example of intensive warfare carried out by an enemy in order to completely eliminate a Maya state, rather than subjugate it."
"In the Classic period, such trophy heads no longer appeared on the king's belt, but Classic period kings are frequently depicted standing over humiliated war captives."
"Right up to the end of the Postclassic period, Maya kings led as war captains."
"Maya inscriptions from the Classic show that a defeated king could be captured, tortured, and sacrificed."
"In some cases, entire cities were sacked, and never resettled, as at Aguateca."
"In other instances, the victors would seize the defeated rulers, their families, and patron gods."
"The captured nobles and their families could be imprisoned, or sacrificed."
"At the least severe end of the scale, the defeated polity would be obliged to pay tribute to the victor."
"It is likely that the specialised knowledge inherent in the particular military role was taught to the successor, including strategy, ritual, and war dances."
"Maya armies of the Contact period were highly disciplined, and warriors participated in regular training exercises and drills; every able-bodied adult male was available for military service."
Maya states did not maintain standing armies; warriors were mustered by local officials who reported back to appointed warleaders.
There were also units of full-time mercenaries who followed permanent leaders.
"Most warriors were not full-time, however, and were primarily farmers; the needs of their crops usually came before warfare."
"By the Postclassic, the native chronicles suggest that women occasionally fought in battle."
The stick was used to launch the missile with more force and accuracy than could be accomplished by simply hurling it with the arm alone.
Evidence in the form of stone blade points recovered from Aguateca indicate that darts and spears were the primary weapons of the Classic Maya warrior.
"Commoners used blowguns in war, which also served as their hunting weapon."
The bow and arrow is another weapon that was used by the ancient Maya for both war and hunting.
"Although present in the Maya region during the Classic period, its use as a weapon of war was not favoured; it did not become a common weapon until the Postclassic."
"The Contact period Maya also used two-handed swords crafted from strong wood with the blade fashioned from inset obsidian, similar to the Aztec macuahuitl."
Maya warriors wore body armour in the form of quilted cotton that had been soaked in salt water to toughen it; the resulting armour compared favourably to the steel armour worn by the Spanish when they conquered the region.
Warriors bore wooden or animal hide shields decorated with feathers and animal skins.
"The cities that grew to become the most important usually controlled access to vital trade goods, or portage routes."
"Cities such as Kaminaljuyu and Qʼumarkaj in the Guatemalan Highlands, and Chalchuapa in El Salvador, variously controlled access to the sources of obsidian at different points in Maya history."
"The Maya were major producers of cotton, which was used to make the textiles to be traded throughout Mesoamerica."
The most important cities in the northern Yucatán Peninsula controlled access to the sources of salt.
"As an illustration, an Early Classic Maya merchant quarter has been identified at the distant metropolis of Teotihuacan, in central Mexico."
"Within Mesoamerica beyond the Maya area, trade routes particularly focused on central Mexico and the Gulf coast."
"In the Early Classic, Chichen Itza was at the hub of an extensive trade network that imported gold discs from Colombia and Panama, and turquoise from Los Cerrillos, New Mexico."
Long distance trade of both luxury and utilitarian goods was probably controlled by the royal family.
"Shifts in trade routes occurred with the rise and fall of important cities in the Maya region, and have been identified in every major reorganization of the Maya civilization, such as the rise of Preclassic Maya civilization, the transition to the Classic, and the Terminal Classic collapse."
"Even the Spanish Conquest did not immediately terminate all Maya trading activity; for example, the Contact period Manche Chʼol traded the prestige crops of cacao, annatto and vanilla into colonial Verapaz."
"From this, it is known that at least some traders were members of the elite."
"During the Contact period, it is known that Maya nobility took part in long distance trading expeditions."
"The majority of traders were middle class, but were largely engaged in local and regional trade rather than the prestigious long distance trading that was the preserve of the elite."
The travelling of merchants into dangerous foreign territory was likened to a passage through the underworld; the patron deities of merchants were two underworld gods carrying backpacks.
A substantial Maya trading canoe was encountered off Honduras on Christopher Columbus's fourth voyage.
It was made from a large hollowed-out tree trunk and had a palm-covered canopy.
"Trade goods carried included cacao, obsidian, ceramics, textiles, food and drink for the crew, and copper bells and axes."
"Cacao was used as currency (although not exclusively), and its value was such that counterfeiting occurred by removing the flesh from the pod, and stuffing it with dirt or avocado rind."
"However, the Spanish reported a thriving market economy when they arrived in the region."
"At some Classic period cities, archaeologists have tentatively identified formal arcade-style masonry architecture and parallel alignments of scattered stones as the permanent foundations of market stalls."
A 2007 study analysed soils from a modern Guatemalan market and compared the results with those obtained from analysis at a proposed ancient market at Chunchucmil.
Unusually high levels of zinc and phosphorus at both sites indicated similar food production and vegetable sales activity.
The calculated density of market stalls at Chunchucmil strongly suggests that a thriving market economy already existed in the Early Classic.
Archaeologists have tentatively identified marketplaces at an increasing number of Maya cities by means of a combination of archaeology and soil analysis.
"When the Spanish arrived, Postclassic cities in the highlands had markets in permanent plazas, with officials on hand to settle disputes, enforce rules, and collect taxes."
It is almost exclusively concerned with the Maya elite and their world.
"Maya art was crafted from both perishable and non-perishable materials, and served to link the Maya to their ancestors."
"Although surviving Maya art represents only a small proportion of the art that the Maya created, it represents a wider variety of subjects than any other art tradition in the Americas."
"Maya art has many regional styles, and is unique in the ancient Americas in bearing narrative text."
"Correspondingly, they placed high value on apple-green jade, and other greenstones, associating them with the sun-god Kʼinich Ajau."
"The Maya nobility practised dental modification, and some lords wore encrusted jade in their teeth."
"Mosaic funerary masks could also be fashioned from jade, such as that of Kʼinich Janaabʼ Pakal, king of Palenque."
"Maya stone sculpture emerged into the archaeological record as a fully developed tradition, suggesting that it may have evolved from a tradition of sculpting wood."
"Because of the biodegradability of wood, the corpus of Maya woodwork has almost entirely disappeared."
"The few wooden artefacts that have survived include three-dimensional sculptures, and hieroglyphic panels."
"Stone Maya stelae are widespread in city sites, often paired with low, circular stones referred to as altars in the literature."
"Stone sculpture also took other forms, such as the limestone relief panels at Palenque and Piedras Negras."
"At Yaxchilan, Dos Pilas, Copán, and other sites, stone stairways were decorated with sculpture."
"The rough form was laid out on a plain plaster base coating on the wall, and the three-dimensional form was built up using small stones."
"Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards."
The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted.
"Walls were coated with plaster, and polychrome designs were painted onto the smooth finish."
"The majority of such murals have not survived, but Early Classic tombs painted in cream, red, and black have been excavated at Caracol, Río Azul, and Tikal."
Among the best preserved murals are a full-size series of Late Classic paintings at Bonampak.
"Flint, chert, and obsidian all served utilitarian purposes in Maya culture, but many pieces were finely crafted into forms that were never intended to be used as tools."
Eccentric flints are among the finest lithic artefacts produced by the ancient Maya.
"They were technically very challenging to produce, requiring considerable skill on the part of the artisan."
Large obsidian eccentrics can measure over 30 centimetres (12 in) in length.
"Their actual form varies considerably but they generally depict human, animal and geometric forms associated with Maya religion."
"Eccentric flints show a great variety of forms, such as crescents, crosses, snakes, and scorpions."
"A few scraps of textile have been recovered by archaeologists, but the best evidence for textile art is where they are represented in other media, such as painted murals or ceramics."
"Such secondary representations show the elite of the Maya court adorned with sumptuous cloths, generally these would have been cotton, but jaguar pelts and deer hides are also shown."
Ceramics are the most commonly surviving type of Maya art.
"The Maya had no knowledge of the potter's wheel, and Maya vessels were built up by coiling rolled strips of clay into the desired form."
"Maya pottery was not glazed, although it often had a fine finish produced by burnishing."
Maya ceramics were painted with clay slips blended with minerals and coloured clays.
Ancient Maya firing techniques have yet to be replicated.
"A quantity of extremely fine ceramic figurines have been excavated from Late Classic tombs on Jaina Island, in northern Yucatán."
"The Ik-style polychrome ceramic corpus, including finely painted plates and cylindrical vessels, originated in Late Classic Motul de San José."
It includes a set of features such as hieroglyphs painted in a pink or pale red colour and scenes with dancers wearing masks.
One of the most distinctive features is the realistic representation of subjects as they appeared in life.
"The Maya valued Spondylus shells, and worked them to remove the white exterior and spines, to reveal the fine orange interior."
"Around the 10th century AD, metallurgy arrived in Mesoamerica from South America, and the Maya began to make small objects in gold, silver and copper."
"The Maya generally hammered sheet metal into objects such as beads, bells, and discs."
"Additional graffiti, not part of the planned decoration, was incised into the stucco of interior walls, floors, and benches, in a wide variety of buildings, including temples, residences, and storerooms."
"Graffiti has been recorded at 51 Maya sites, particularly clustered in the Petén Basin and southern Campeche, and the Chenes region of northwestern Yucatán."
"At Tikal, where a great quantity of graffiti has been recorded, the subject matter includes drawings of temples, people, deities, animals, banners, litters, and thrones."
"Graffiti was often inscribed haphazardly, with drawings overlapping each other, and display a mix of crude, untrained art, and examples by artists who were familiar with Classic-period artistic conventions."
Maya architecture also incorporates various art forms and hieroglyphic texts.
"Masonry architecture built by the Maya evidences craft specialization in Maya society, centralised organization and the political means to mobilize a large workforce."
"It is estimated that a large elite residence at Copán required an estimated 10,686 man-days to build, which compares to 67-man-days for a commoner's hut."
"It is further estimated that 65% of the labour required to build the noble residence was used in the quarrying, transporting, and finishing of the stone used in construction, and 24% of the labour was required for the manufacture and application of limestone-based plaster."
"Altogether, it is estimated that two to three months were required for the construction of the residence for this single noble at Copán, using between 80 and 130 full-time labourers."
"The labour required to build such a city was immense, running into many millions of man-days."
The most massive structures ever erected by the Maya were built during the Preclassic period.
"Craft specialization would have required dedicated stonemasons and plasterers by the Late Preclassic, and would have required planners and architects."
"Most Maya cities tended to grow outwards from the core, and upwards as new structures were superimposed upon preceding architecture."
Maya cities usually had a ceremonial and administrative centre surrounded by a vast irregular sprawl of residential complexes.
"The centres of all Maya cities featured sacred precincts, sometimes separated from nearby residential areas by walls."
"These precincts contained pyramid temples and other monumental architecture dedicated to elite activities, such as basal platforms that supported administrative or elite residential complexes."
Sculpted monuments were raised to record the deeds of the ruling dynasty.
"City centres also featured plazas, sacred ballcourts and buildings used for marketplaces and schools."
Frequently causeways linked the centre to outlying areas of the city.
"Some of these classes of architecture formed lesser groups in the outlying areas of the city, which served as sacred centres for non-royal lineages."
The areas adjacent to these sacred compounds included residential complexes housing wealthy lineages.
It was also where the inhabitants of the city gathered for public activities.
"Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed further away from the ceremonial centre."
Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.
"The exact type of stone used in masonry construction varied according to locally available resources, and this also affected the building style."
"Across a broad swathe of the Maya area, limestone was immediately available."
"The local limestone is relatively soft when freshly cut, but hardens with exposure."
"There was great variety in the quality of limestone, with good-quality stone available in the Usumacinta region; in the northern Yucatán, the limestone used in construction was of relatively poor quality."
"Volcanic tuff was used at Copán, and nearby Quiriguá employed sandstone."
"In Comalcalco, where suitable stone was not available locally, fired bricks were employed."
"Limestone was burned at high temperatures in order to manufacture cement, plaster, and stucco."
"Lime-based cement was used to seal stonework in place, and stone blocks were fashioned using rope-and-water abrasion, and with obsidian tools."
"The Maya did not employ a functional wheel, so all loads were transported on litters, barges, or rolled on logs."
"Throughout Maya history, common huts and some temples continued to be built from wooden poles and thatch."
Adobe was also applied; this consisted of mud strengthened with straw and was applied as a coating over the woven-stick walls of huts.
"Like wood and thatch, adobe was used throughout Maya history, even after the development of masonry structures."
"In the southern Maya area, adobe was employed in monumental architecture when no suitable stone was locally available."
Some cities also possessed extensive hydraulic systems or defensive walls.
"The exteriors of most buildings were painted, either in one or multiple colours, or with imagery."
Many buildings were adorned with sculpture or painted stucco reliefs.
Maya palaces consisted of a platform supporting a multiroom range structure.
"The term acropolis, in a Maya context, refers to a complex of structures built upon platforms of varying height."
Palaces and acropoleis were essentially elite residential compounds.
"They generally extended horizontally as opposed to the towering Maya pyramids, and often had restricted access."
Some structures in Maya acropoleis supported roof combs.
"Rooms often had stone benches, used for sleeping, and holes indicate where curtains once hung."
"Large palaces, such as at Palenque, could be fitted with a water supply, and sweat baths were often found within the complex, or nearby."
"During the Early Classic, rulers were sometimes buried underneath the acropolis complex."
Some palaces possess associated hieroglyphic descriptions that identify them as the royal residences of named rulers.
"There is abundant evidence that palaces were far more than simple elite residences, and that a range of courtly activities took place in them, including audiences, formal receptions, and important rituals."
"Temples were raised on platforms, most often upon a pyramid."
The earliest temples were probably thatched huts built upon low platforms.
"By the Late Preclassic period, their walls were of stone, and the development of the corbel arch allowed stone roofs to replace thatch."
"By the Classic period, temple roofs were being topped with roof combs that extended the height of the temple and served as a foundation for monumental art."
"The temple shrines contained between one and three rooms, and were dedicated to important deities."
"Such a deity might be one of the patron gods of the city, or a deified ancestor."
"In general, freestanding pyramids were shrines honouring powerful ancestors."
E-Groups were a particular arrangement of temples that were relatively common in the Maya region; they take their names from Group E at Uaxactun.
"They consisted of three small structures facing a fourth structure, and were used to mark the solstices and equinoxes."
The earliest examples date to the Preclassic period.
"Due to its nature, the basic layout of an E-Group was constant."
A structure was built on the west side of a plaza; it was usually a radial pyramid with stairways facing the cardinal directions.
It faced east across the plaza to three small temples on the far side.
"From the west pyramid, the sun was seen to rise over these temples on the solstices and equinoxes."
"Many Maya buildings were aligned with astronomical bodies, including the planet Venus, and various constellations."
"The Caracol structure at Chichen Itza was a circular multi-level edifice, with a conical superstructure."
It has slit windows that marked the movements of Venus.
"At Copán, a pair of stelae were raised to mark the position of the setting sun at the equinoxes."
"They consisted of a dominant structure flanked by two smaller inward-facing buildings, all mounted upon a single basal platform."
"The largest known triadic pyramid was built at El Mirador in the Petén Basin; it covers an area six times as large as that covered by Temple IV, the largest pyramid at Tikal."
The three superstructures all have stairways leading up from the central plaza on top of the basal platform.
"No securely established forerunners of Triadic Groups are known, but they may have developed from the eastern range building of E-Group complexes."
The triadic form was the predominant architectural form in the Petén region during the Late Preclassic.
Examples of triadic pyramids are known from as many as 88 archaeological sites.
"At Nakbe, there are at least a dozen examples of triadic complexes and the four largest structures in the city are triadic in nature."
At El Mirador there are probably as many as 36 triadic structures.
"Examples of the triadic form are even known from Dzibilchaltun in the far north of the Yucatán Peninsula, and Qʼumarkaj in the Highlands of Guatemala."
"The triadic pyramid remained a popular architectural form for centuries after the first examples were built; it continued in use into the Classic Period, with later examples being found at Uaxactun, Caracol, Seibal, Nakum, Tikal and Palenque."
The Qʼumarkaj example is the only one that has been dated to the Postclassic Period.
The triple-temple form of the triadic pyramid appears to be related to Maya mythology.
"Although the majority of Maya ballcourts date to the Classic period, the earliest examples appeared around 1000 BC in northwestern Yucatán, during the Middle Preclassic."
"By the time of Spanish contact, ballcourts were only in use in the Guatemalan Highlands, at cities such as Qʼumarkaj and Iximche."
"Throughout Maya history, ballcourts maintained a characteristic form consisting of an ɪ shape, with a central playing area terminating in two transverse end zones."
The lateral platforms often supported structures that may have held privileged spectators.
"Such styles were influenced by locally available construction materials, climate, topography, and local preferences."
"In the Late Classic, these local differences developed into distinctive regional architectural styles."
"The style is characterised by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway."
"Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the decoration of architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods."
One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I.
"Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá."
The style developed in the Puuc Hills of northwestern Yucatán; during the Terminal Classic it spread beyond this core region across the northern Yucatán Peninsula.
"Puuc sites replaced rubble cores with lime cement, resulting in stronger walls, and also strengthened their corbel arches; this allowed Puuc-style cities to build freestanding entrance archways."
"The upper façades of buildings were decorated with precut stones mosaic-fashion, erected as facing over the core, forming elaborate compositions of long-nosed deities such as the rain god Chaac and the Principal Bird Deity."
"The motifs also included geometric patterns, lattices and spools, possibly influenced by styles from highland Oaxaca, outside the Maya area."
"In contrast, the lower façades were left undecorated."
Roof combs were relatively uncommon at Puuc sites.
It featured fully adorned façades on both the upper and lower sections of structures.
"Some doorways were surrounded by mosaic masks of monsters representing mountain or sky deities, identifying the doorways as entrances to the supernatural realm."
Some buildings contained interior stairways that accessed different levels.
"The Chenes style is most commonly encountered in the southern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula, although individual buildings in the style can be found elsewhere in the peninsula."
"Examples of Chenes sites include Dzibilnocac, Hochob, Santa Rosa Xtampak, and Tabasqueño."
"Its palaces are distinctive for their false-tower decorations, lacking interior rooms, with steep, almost vertical, stairways and false doors."
"These towers were adorned with deity masks, and were built to impress the viewer, rather than serve any practical function."
"Río Bec sites include Chicanná, Hormiguero, and Xpuhil."
"Cities took advantage of the hillsides to support their major architecture, as at Palenque and Yaxchilan."
Sites modified corbel vaulting to allow thinner walls and multiple access doors to temples.
"As in Petén, roof combs adorned principal structures."
Palaces had multiple entrances that used post-and-lintel entrances rather than corbel vaulting.
"Many sites erected stelae, but Palenque instead developed finely sculpted panelling to decorate its buildings."
"Linguistic analysis of reconstructed Proto-Mayan vocabulary suggests that the original Proto-Mayan homeland was in the western or northern Guatemalan Highlands, although the evidence is not conclusive."
"Proto-Mayan diverged during the Preclassic period to form the major Mayan language groups that make up the family, including Huastecan, Greater Kʼicheʼan, Greater Qʼanjobalan, Mamean, Tzʼeltalan-Chʼolan, and Yucatecan."
These groups diverged further during the pre-Columbian era to form over 30 languages that have survived into modern times.
"The language of almost all Classic Maya texts over the entire Maya area has been identified as Chʼolan; Late Preclassic text from Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands, also appears to be in, or related to, Chʼolan."
The use of Chʼolan as the language of Maya text does not necessarily indicate that it was the language commonly used by the local populace – it may have been equivalent to Medieval Latin as a ritual or prestige language.
"Classic Chʼolan may have been the prestige language of the Classic Maya elite, used in inter-polity communication such as diplomacy and trade."
"By the Postclassic period, Yucatec was also being written in Maya codices alongside Chʼolan."
It was the most sophisticated and highly developed writing system of more than a dozen systems that developed in Mesoamerica.
"However, this is preceded by several other Mesoamerican writing systems, such as the Epi-Olmec and Zapotec scripts."
"Early Maya script had appeared on the Pacific coast of Guatemala by the late 1st century AD, or early 2nd century."
Similarities between the Isthmian script and Early Maya script of the Pacific coast suggest that the two systems developed in tandem.
"These are known as the Madrid Codex, the Dresden Codex and the Paris Codex."
"A few pages survive from a fourth, the Grolier Codex, whose authenticity is disputed."
"Archaeology conducted at Maya sites often reveals other fragments, rectangular lumps of plaster and paint chips which were codices; these tantalizing remains are, however, too severely damaged for any inscriptions to have survived, most of the organic material having decayed."
"Most surviving pre-Columbian Maya writing dates to the Classic period and is contained in stone inscriptions from Maya sites, such as stelae, or on ceramics vessels."
"Other media include the aforementioned codices, stucco façades, frescoes, wooden lintels, cave walls, and portable artefacts crafted from a variety of materials, including bone, shell, obsidian, and jade."
"Among the writing systems of the Pre-Columbian New World, Maya script most closely represents the spoken language."
"In excess of 10,000 individual texts have been recovered, mostly inscribed on stone monuments, lintels, stelae and ceramics."
The Maya also produced texts painted on a form of paper manufactured from processed tree-bark generally now known by its Nahuatl-language name amatl used to produce codices.
The skill and knowledge of Maya writing persisted among segments of the population right up to the Spanish conquest.
"Some elements were first deciphered in the late 19th and early 20th century, mostly the parts having to do with numbers, the Maya calendar, and astronomy."
"Major breakthroughs were made from the 1950s to 1970s, and accelerated rapidly thereafter."
"By the end of the 20th century, scholars were able to read the majority of Maya texts, and ongoing work continues to further illuminate the content."
"The block is composed of one or more individual glyphs attached to each other to form the glyph block, with individual glyph blocks generally being separated by a space."
Glyph blocks are usually arranged in a grid pattern.
"For ease of reference, epigraphers refer to glyph blocks from left to right alphabetically, and top to bottom numerically."
"Thus, any glyph block in a piece of text can be identified."
"C4 would be third block counting from the left, and the fourth block counting downwards."
"If a monument or artefact has more than one inscription, column labels are not repeated, rather they continue in the alphabetic series; if there are more than 26 columns, the labelling continues as A', B', etc."
"The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion."
"Once the bottom is reached, the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column."
"These consist of the main sign, and any affixes."
"Main signs represent the major element of the block, and may be a noun, verb, adverb, adjective, or phonetic sign."
"Some main signs are abstract, some are pictures of the object they represent, and others are ""head variants"", personifications of the word they represent."
"Affixes are smaller rectangular elements, usually attached to a main sign, although a block may be composed entirely of affixes."
"Affixes may represent a wide variety of speech elements, including nouns, verbs, verbal suffixes, prepositions, pronouns, and more."
"Small sections of a main sign could be used to represent the whole main sign, and Maya scribes were highly inventive in their usage and adaptation of glyph elements."
"A Classic period sculpture from Copán, Honduras, depicts a scribe with an inkpot fashioned from a conch shell."
"Excavations at Aguateca uncovered a number of scribal artefacts from the residences of elite status scribes, including palettes and mortars and pestles."
"It is not known if all members of the aristocracy could read and write, although at least some women could, since there are representations of female scribes in Maya art."
There were probably scribal schools where members of the aristocracy were taught to write.
"Scribal activity is identifiable in the archaeological record; Jasaw Chan Kʼawiil I, king of Tikal, was interred with his paint pot."
Some junior members of the Copán royal dynasty have also been found buried with their writing implements.
"Usually, only a single scribe signed a ceramic vessel, but multiple sculptors are known to have recorded their names on stone sculpture; eight sculptors signed one stela at Piedras Negras."
"However, most works remained unsigned by their artists."
"The bar-and-dot counting system that is the base of Maya numerals was in use in Mesoamerica by 1000 BC; the Maya adopted it by the Late Preclassic, and added the symbol for zero."
"This may have been the earliest known occurrence of the idea of an explicit zero worldwide, although it may have been predated by the Babylonian system."
The earliest explicit use of zero occurred on monuments dated to 357 AD.
"In its earliest uses, the zero served as a place holder, indicating an absence of a particular calendrical count."
By the Postclassic period a shell symbol represented zero; during the Classic period other glyphs were used.
The Maya numerals from 0 to 19 used repetitions of these symbols.
"The value of a numeral was determined by its position; as a numeral shifted upwards, its basic value multiplied by twenty."
"In this way, the lowest symbol would represent units, the next symbol up would represent multiples of twenty, and the symbol above that would represent multiples of 400, and so on."
"Using this system, the Maya were able to record huge numbers."
Simple addition could be performed by summing the dots and bars in two columns to give the result in a third column.
"However, it was the Maya that developed the calendar to its maximum sophistication, recording lunar and solar cycles, eclipses and movements of planets with great accuracy."
"In some cases, the Maya calculations were more accurate than equivalent calculations in the Old World; for example, the Maya solar year was calculated to greater accuracy than the Julian year."
"The Maya calendar was intrinsically tied to Maya ritual, and it was central to Maya religious practices."
"The calendar combined a non-repeating Long Count with three interlocking cycles, each measuring a progressively larger period."
Each succeeding level of multiplication followed the vigesimal system.
"This is reinforced by the use of the tzolkʼin to record dates of birth, and provide corresponding prophecy."
This was believed by the Maya to be the day of the creation of the world in its current form.
The Maya used the Long Count Calendar to fix any given day of the Calendar Round within their current great Piktun cycle consisting of either 20 bakʼtuns.
The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates.
"The most generally accepted correlation is the Goodman-Martínez-Thompson, or GMT, correlation."
Epigraphers Simon Martin and Nikolai Grube argue for a two-day shift from the standard GMT correlation.
Radiocarbon dating of dated wooden lintels at Tikal supports the GMT correlation.
"We may look down our noses at his ideas, but one may be sure that in outlook he was far closer to a Maya priest astronomer than is an astronomer of our century."
"The Maya made meticulous observations of celestial bodies, patiently recording astronomical data on the movements of the sun, moon, Venus, and the stars."
"This information was used for divination, so Maya astronomy was essentially for astrological purposes."
"Although Mayan astronomy was mainly used by the priesthood to comprehend past cycles of time, and project them into the future to produce prophecy, it also had some practical applications, such as providing aid in crop planting and harvesting."
"The priesthood refined observations and recorded eclipses of the sun and moon, and movements of Venus and the stars; these were measured against dated events in the past, on the assumption that similar events would occur in the future when the same astronomical conditions prevailed."
"Illustrations in the codices show that priests made astronomical observations using the naked eye, assisted by crossed sticks as a sighting device."
"The Maya also followed the movements of Jupiter, Mars and Mercury."
"When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this was associated with the rebirth of the Maya Hero Twins."
"For the Maya, the heliacal rising of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval."
"Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning ""war"" incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet."
Sight-lines through the windows of the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path.
"Eclipses were interpreted as the sun or moon being bitten, and lunar tables were recorded in order that the Maya might be able to predict them, and perform the appropriate ceremonies to ward off disaster."
"At the core of Maya religious practice was the worship of deceased ancestors, who would intercede for their living descendants in dealings with the supernatural realm."
The earliest intermediaries between humans and the supernatural were shamans.
"Maya ritual included the use of hallucinogens for chilan, oracular priests."
"Visions for the chilan were likely facilitated by consumption of water lilies, which are hallucinogenic in high doses."
"As the Maya civilization developed, the ruling elite codified the Maya world view into religious cults that justified their right to rule."
"There were thirteen levels in the heavens and nine in the underworld, with the mortal world in between."
"Each level had four cardinal directions associated with a different colour; north was white, east was red, south was yellow, and west was black."
There the dead could act as protective ancestors.
"Maya lineages were patrilineal, so the worship of a prominent male ancestor would be emphasised, often with a household shrine."
"Maya deities governed all aspects of the world, both visible and invisible."
"The Maya priesthood was a closed group, drawing its members from the established elite; by the Early Classic they were recording increasingly complex ritual information in their hieroglyphic books, including astronomical observations, calendrical cycles, history and mythology."
"The priests performed public ceremonies that incorporated feasting, bloodletting, incense burning, music, ritual dance, and, on certain occasions, human sacrifice."
"During the Classic period, the Maya ruler was the high priest, and the direct conduit between mortals and the gods."
"It is highly likely that, among commoners, shamanism continued in parallel to state religion."
"One important, though incomplete, resource is physical evidence, such as dedicatory caches and other ritual deposits, shrines, and burials with their associated funerary offerings."
"Maya art, architecture, and writing are another resource, and these can be combined with ethnographic sources, including records of Maya religious practices made by the Spanish during the conquest."
"By extension, the sacrifice of a human life was the ultimate offering of blood to the gods, and the most important Maya rituals culminated in human sacrifice."
"The sacrifice of an enemy king was the most prized, and such a sacrifice involved decapitation of the captive ruler in a ritual reenactment of the decapitation of the Maya maize god by the death gods."
"In AD 738, the vassal king Kʼakʼ Tiliw Chan Yopaat of Quiriguá captured his overlord, Uaxaclajuun Ubʼaah Kʼawiil of Copán and a few days later ritually decapitated him."
"Sacrifice by decapitation is depicted in Classic period Maya art, and sometimes took place after the victim was tortured, being variously beaten, scalped, burnt or disembowelled."
"In one ritual, the corpse would be skinned by assistant priests, except for the hands and feet, and the officiating priest would then dress himself in the skin of the sacrificial victim and perform a ritual dance symbolizing the rebirth of life."
Archaeological investigations indicate that heart sacrifice was practised as early as the Classic period.
The Maya had such a broad interpretation of the sacred that identifying distinct deities with specific functions is inaccurate.
"The Maya interpretation of deities was closely tied to the calendar, astronomy, and their cosmology."
"The importance of a deity, its characteristics, and its associations varied according to the movement of celestial bodies."
"The priestly interpretation of astronomical records and books was therefore crucial, since the priest would understand which deity required ritual propitiation, when the correct ceremonies should be performed, and what would be an appropriate offering."
"Each deity had four manifestations, associated with the cardinal directions, each identified with a different colour."
Maya kings frequently identified themselves with Kʼinich Ahau.
"Itzamna also had a night sun aspect, the Night Jaguar, representing the sun in its journey through the underworld."
"The four Pawatuns supported the corners of the mortal realm; in the heavens, the Bacabs performed the same function."
"As well as their four main aspects, the Bakabs had dozens of other aspects that are not well understood."
"The four Chaacs were storm gods, controlling thunder, lightning, and the rains."
The nine lords of the night each governed one of the underworld realms.
It is one of the most outstanding works of indigenous literature in the Americas.
"The Popul Vuh recounts the mythical creation of the world, the legend of the Hero Twins, and the history of the Postclassic Kʼicheʼ kingdom."
"Such worship was rare during the Classic period, but by the Postclassic the feathered serpent had spread to both the Yucatán Peninsula and the Guatemalan Highlands."
"Kukulkan had his origins in the Classic period War Serpent, Waxaklahun Ubah Kan, and has also been identified as the Postclassic version of the Vision Serpent of Classic Maya art."
"Although the cult of Kukulkan had its origins in these earlier Maya traditions, the worship of Kukulkan was heavily influenced by the Quetzalcoatl cult of central Mexico."
"It was believed that shifting cultivation (swidden) agriculture provided most of their food, but it is now thought that permanent raised fields, terracing, intensive gardening, forest gardens, and managed fallows were also crucial to supporting the large populations of the Classic period in some areas."
"Indeed, evidence of these different agricultural systems persist today: raised fields connected by canals can be seen on aerial photographs."
These were supplemented with a wide variety of other plants either cultivated in gardens or gathered in the forest.
"At Joya de Cerén, a volcanic eruption preserved a record of foodstuffs stored in Maya homes, among them were chilies and tomatoes."
"Cotton seeds were in the process of being ground, perhaps to produce cooking oil."
"In addition to basic foodstuffs, the Maya also cultivated prestige crops such as cotton, cacao and vanilla."
"Cacao was especially prized by the elite, who consumed chocolate beverages."
"Ocellated turkeys were unsuitable for domestication, but were rounded up in the wild and penned for fattening."
All of these were used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting.
It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.
"The six sites with particularly outstanding architecture or sculpture are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxmal, and Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copán in Honduras."
"Other important, but difficult to reach, sites include Calakmul and El Mirador."
"The principal sites in the Puuc region, after Uxmal, are Kabah, Labna, and Sayil."
In the east of the Yucatán Peninsula are Coba and the small site of Tulum.
"An extended period of political turmoil followed, which included the Execution of Louis XVI and the Reign of Terror."
"In June, the Estates were converted into a National Assembly, which passed a series of radical measures, among them the abolition of feudalism, state control of the Catholic Church and extending the right to vote."
"The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, exacerbated by economic depression and social unrest."
"External powers like Austria, Britain and Prussia viewed the Revolution as a threat, leading to the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792."
"In June, an uprising in Paris replaced the Girondins who dominated the National Assembly with the Committee of Public Safety, headed by Maximilien Robespierre."
"As well as external enemies, the Republic faced a series of internal Royalist and Jacobin revolts; in order to deal with these, the French Directory took power in November 1795."
"Despite military success, the war led to economic stagnation and internal divisions, and in November 1799 the Directory was replaced by the French Consulate."
"Over the next two centuries, its key principles like equality would inspire campaigns for the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage."
"Its values and institutions dominate French politics to this day, and many historians regard the Revolution as one of the most important events in human history."
"Rapid population growth and restrictions caused by the inability to adequately finance government debt resulted in economic depression, unemployment and high food prices."
"Combined with a regressive tax system and resistance to reform by the ruling elite, the result was a crisis Louis XVI proved unable to manage."
"From the late 17th century on, political and cultural debate became part of wider European society, rather than being confined to a small elite."
"This took different forms, such as the English 'coffeehouse culture', and extended to areas colonised by Europeans, particularly British North America."
"Contacts between diverse groups in Edinburgh, Geneva, Boston, Amsterdam, Paris, London or Vienna were much greater than often appreciated."
"Under Louis XIV, the Court at Versailles was the centre of culture, fashion and political power."
"Improvements in education and literacy over the course of the 18th century meant larger audiences for newspapers and journals, with Masonic lodges, coffee houses and reading clubs providing areas where people could debate and discuss ideas."
"Inefficient agricultural methods meant domestic farmers could not support these numbers, while primitive transportation networks made it hard to maintain supplies even when there was sufficient."
"Food shortages were particularly damaging for the regime, since many blamed price increases on government failure to prevent profiteering."
"Although French borrowing costs were higher, the percentage of tax revenue devoted to interest payments was about the same in both countries."
"The underlying problem was these taxes were predominantly paid by the urban and rural poor, and attempts to share the burden more equally were blocked by the regional parlements which controlled financial policy."
"The resulting impasse in the face of widespread economic distress led to the calling of the Estates-General, which became radicalised by the struggle for control of public finances."
"The court became the target of popular anger, especially Queen Marie-Antoinette, who was viewed as a spendthrift Austrian spy, and blamed for the dismissal of 'progressive' ministers like Jacques Necker."
"For their opponents, Enlightenment ideas on equality and democracy provided an intellectual framework for dealing with these issues, while the American Revolution was seen as confirmation of their practical application."
"Unlike Britain, where Parliament determined both expenditures and taxes, in France, the Crown controlled spending, but not revenue."
"Although willing to authorise one-time taxes, these bodies were reluctant to pass long-term measures, while collection was outsourced to private individuals."
"This significantly reduced the yield from those that were approved and as a result, France struggled to service its debt despite being larger and wealthier than Britain."
"The war was financed by state debt, creating a large rentier class who lived on the interest, primarily members of the French nobility or commercial classes."
"By 1785 the government was struggling to cover these payments; since default would ruin much of French society, this required an increase in taxes."
"When the parlements refused to comply, Calonne persuaded Louis to summon the Assembly of Notables, an advisory council dominated by the upper nobility."
"Led by de Brienne, former archbishop of Toulouse,  the Assembly argued that tax increases could only be authorised by the Estates-General."
"Although they contained ideas that would have seemed radical only months before,  most supported the monarchy, and assumed the Estates-General would agree to financial reforms, rather than fundamental constitutional change."
"The lifting of press censorship allowed widespread distribution of political writings, mostly written by liberal members of the aristocracy and upper middle-class."
"As was customary, each Estate assembled in separate rooms, whose furnishings and opening ceremonies deliberately emphasised the superiority of the First and Second Estates."
"They also insisted on enforcing the rule that only those who owned land could sit as deputies for the Second Estate, and thus excluded the immensely popular Comte de Mirabeau."
"As separate assemblies meant the Third Estate could always be outvoted by the other two, Sieyès sought to combine all three."
"His method was to require all deputies be approved by the Estates-General as a whole, instead of each Estate verifying its own members."
"Since this meant the legitimacy of deputies derived from the Estates-General, they would have to continue sitting as one body."
"After an extended stalemate, on 10 June the Third Estate proceeded to verify its own deputies, a process completed on 17 June; two days later, they were joined by over 100 members of the First Estate, and declared themselves the National Assembly."
The governor de Launay surrendered after several hours of fighting that cost the lives of 83 attackers.
"Taken to the Hôtel de Ville, he was executed, his head placed on a pike and paraded around the city; the fortress was then torn down in a remarkably short time."
"Although rumoured to hold many prisoners, the Bastille held only seven: four forgers, two noblemen held for ""immoral behaviour"", and a murder suspect."
"Nevertheless, as a potent symbol of the Ancien Régime, its destruction was viewed as a triumph and Bastille Day is still celebrated every year."
"Alarmed by the prospect of losing control of the capital, Louis appointed Lafayette commander of the National Guard, with Jean-Sylvain Bailly as head of a new administrative structure known as the Commune."
"However, it was clear power had shifted from his court; he was welcomed as 'Louis XVI, father of the French and king of a free people."
'The short-lived unity enforced on the Assembly by a common threat quickly dissipated.
"Deputies argued over constitutional forms, while civil authority rapidly deteriorated."
"In rural areas, wild rumours and paranoia resulted in the formation of militia and an agrarian insurrection known as la Grande Peur."
The breakdown of law and order and frequent attacks on aristocratic property led much of the nobility to flee abroad.
"Other decrees included equality before the law, opening public office to all, freedom of worship, and cancellation of special privileges held by provinces and towns."
"From its early stages, the Revolution therefore displayed signs of its radical nature; what remained unclear was the constitutional mechanism for turning intentions into practical applications."
"However France had reached no consensus on the role of the Crown, and until this question was settled, it was impossible to create political institutions."
"Although Jefferson made major contributions to Lafayette's draft, he himself acknowledged an intellectual debt to Montesquieu, and the final version was significantly different."
"Mounier, supported by conservatives like Gérard de Lally-Tollendal, wanted a bicameral system, with an upper house appointed by the king, who would have the right of veto."
"On this basis, a new committee was convened to agree on a constitution; the most controversial issue was citizenship, linked to the debate on the balance between individual rights and obligations."
"This came to a head in late September, when the Flanders Regiment arrived in Versailles to take over as the royal bodyguard and in line with normal practice were welcomed with a ceremonial banquet."
"These protests quickly turned political, and after seizing weapons stored at the Hôtel de Ville, some 7,000 marched on Versailles, where they entered the Assembly to present their demands."
"Next morning, some of the protestors broke into the Royal apartments, searching for Marie Antoinette, who escaped."
"They ransacked the palace, killing several guards."
"Although the situation remained tense, order was eventually restored, and the Royal family and Assembly left for Paris, escorted by the National Guard."
"Announcing his acceptance of the August Decrees and the Declaration, Louis committed to constitutional monarchy, and his official title changed from 'King of France' to 'King of the French'."
"One suggestion is that after a century of persecution, some French Protestants actively supported an anti-Catholic regime, a resentment fuelled by Enlightenment thinkers such as Voltaire."
"The Revolution caused a massive shift of power from the Catholic Church to the state; although the extent of religious belief has been questioned, elimination of tolerance for religious minorities meant by 1789 being French also meant being Catholic."
"The church was the largest individual landowner in France, controlling nearly 10% of all estates and levied tithes, effectively a 10% tax on income, collected from peasant farmers in the form of crops."
"In return, the state assumed responsibilities such as paying the clergy and caring for the poor, the sick and the orphaned."
Pope Pius VI and many French Catholics objected to this since it denied the authority of the Pope over the French Church.
"This stiffened popular resistance against state interference, especially in traditionally Catholic areas such as Normandy, Brittany and the Vendée, where only a few priests took the oath and the civilian population turned against the revolution."
"Widespread refusal led to further legislation against the clergy, many of whom were forced into exile, deported, or executed."
"While certainly true, many provincial areas experienced conflict over the source of legitimate authority, where officers of the Ancien Régime had been swept away, but new structures were not yet in place."
"This was less obvious in Paris, since the formation of the National Guard made it the best policed city in Europe, but growing disorder in the provinces inevitably affected members of the Assembly."
"Centrists led by Sieyès, Lafayette, Mirabeau and Bailly created a majority by forging consensus with monarchiens like Mounier, and independents including Adrien Duport, Barnave and Alexandre Lameth."
"At one end of the political spectrum, reactionaries like Cazalès and Maury denounced the Revolution in all its forms, with extremists like Maximilien Robespierre at the other."
"He and Jean-Paul Marat gained increasing support for opposing the criteria for 'active citizens', which had disenfranchised much of the Parisian proletariat."
"Despite this show of unity, the Assembly was increasingly divided, while external players like the Paris Commune and National Guard competed for power."
"However, moderate deputies were uneasy at popular demands for universal suffrage, labour unions and cheap bread, and over the winter of 1790 and 1791, they passed a series of measures intended to disarm popular radicalism."
"Growing disorder meant many professional officers either left or became émigrés, further destabilising the institution."
"The attempted escape had a profound impact on public opinion; since it was clear Louis had been seeking refuge in Austria, the Assembly now demanded oaths of loyalty to the regime, and began preparing for war, while fear of 'spies and traitors' became pervasive."
"Despite calls to replace the monarchy with a republic, Louis retained his position but was generally regarded with acute suspicion and forced to swear allegiance to the constitution."
"A new decree stated retracting this oath, making war upon the nation, or permitting anyone to do so in his name would be considered abdication."
"On 27 August, Emperor Leopold II and Frederick William II of Prussia issued the Declaration of Pillnitz declaring their support for Louis, and hinting at an invasion of France on his behalf."
"In reality, Leopold and Frederick had met to discuss the Partitions of Poland, and the Declaration was primarily made to satisfy Comte d'Artois and other émigrés."
"Although Robespierre himself was one of those excluded, his support in the clubs gave him a political power base not available to Lafayette and Bailly, who resigned respectively as head of the National Guard and the Paris Commune."
"On 30 September, the Constituent Assembly was dissolved, and the Legislative Assembly convened the next day."
"These were exacerbated by Louis' refusal to accept limitations on his powers and attempts to mobilise external support to reverse it, combined with discontent over rising prices due to monetary inflation, which particularly impacted the urban working class."
"245 were affiliated with the Feuillants, led by Barnave, constitutional monarchists who considered the Revolution had gone far enough."
"136 were Jacobin leftists, led by Brissot and often referred to as Brissotins, who regarded Louis with hostility and wanted a republic."
"The first concerned émigrés; between October and November, the Assembly approved measures confiscating their property and threatening them with the death penalty."
"The second was non-juring priests; opposition to the Civil Constitution had resulted in a state of near civil war in southern France, which Bernave tried to defuse by relaxing the more punitive provisions."
"On 29 November, the Assembly passed a decree giving refractory clergy eight days to comply, or face charges of 'conspiracy against the nation', which even Robespierre viewed as too far, too soon."
"Accompanying this was a campaign for war against Austria and Prussia, also led by Brissot, whose aims have been interpreted as a mixture of cynical calculation and revolutionary idealism."
"It exploited popular anti-Austrianism, especially as represented by Marie Antoinette, but also a genuine belief in exporting the values of political liberty and popular sovereignty."
"Ironically, Marie Antoinette headed a faction within the court that also favoured war, seeing it as a way to win control of the military, and restore royal authority."
"On the morning of 10 August, a combined force of Parisian National Guard and provincial fédérés attacked the Tuileries Palace, killing many of the Swiss Guard protecting it."
"Louis and his family took refuge with the Assembly and shortly after 11:00 am, the deputies present voted to 'temporarily relieve the king', effectively suspending the monarchy."
"The former Brissotins now split into moderate Girondins led by Brissot, and radical Montagnards, headed by Maximilien Robespierre, Georges Danton and Jean-Paul Marat."
"While loyalties constantly shifted, around 160 of the 749 deputies were Girondists, 200 Montagnards and 389 members of La Plaine."
"Responsibility is disputed, but even moderates expressed sympathy for the action, which soon spread to the provinces; the killings reflected widespread concern over social disorder On 20 September, the French army won a stunning victory over the Prussians at Valmy."
"The next few months were taken up with the trial of Citoyen Louis Capet, formerly Louis XVI."
"While the Convention was evenly divided on the question of his guilt, members were increasingly influenced by radicals centred in the Jacobin clubs and Paris Commune."
"Horrified conservatives across Europe called for the destruction of revolutionary France; in February the Convention anticipated this by declaring war on Britain and the Dutch Republic; these countries were later joined by Spain, Portugal, Naples and the Tuscany in the War of the First Coalition."
Many left for the provinces.
"Already unsettled by changes imposed on the church, in March the traditionally conservative and royalist Vendée rose in revolt."
"On 18th, Dumouriez was defeated at Neerwinden and defected to the Austrians."
"Uprisings followed in Bordeaux, Lyon, Toulon, Marseilles and Caen."
"The Girondins made a fatal political error by indicting Marat before the Revolutionary Tribunal for allegedly directing the September massacres; he was quickly acquitted, further isolating the Girondins from the sans-culottes."
Growing discontent allowed the clubs to mobilise against the Girondins.
"The urgent task of suppressing internal dissent was helped by divisions among their opponents; while areas like the Vendée and Brittany wanted to restore the monarchy, most supported the Republic but opposed the regime in Paris."
"At the end of July, the Convention set price controls over a wide range of goods, with the death penalty for hoarders, and on 9 September 'revolutionary groups' were established to enforce them."
"However, France's biggest challenge was servicing the huge public debt inherited from the former regime, which continued to expand due to the war."
"Initially financed by sales of confiscated property, this was hugely inefficient; since few would buy assets that might be repossessed, fiscal stability could only be achieved by continuing the war until French counter-revolutionaries had been defeated."
"In mid-October, Marie Antoinette was found guilty of a long list of crimes and guillotined; two weeks later, the Girondist leaders arrested in June were also executed, along with Philippe Égalité."
The extent of the brutal repression that followed has been debated by French historians since the mid-19th century.
"Although those numbers have been challenged, François Furet concluded it ""not only revealed massacre and destruction on an unprecedented scale, but a zeal so violent that it has bestowed as its legacy much of the region's identity."""
"At the height of the Terror, the slightest hint of counter-revolutionary thought could place one under suspicion, and even its supporters were not immune."
"Under the pressure of events, splits appeared within the Montagnard faction, with violent disagreements between radical Hébertists and moderates led by Danton."
"Robespierre saw their dispute as de-stabilising the regime, and as a deist he objected to the anti-religious policies advocated by the atheist Hébert."
"Those arrested in the provinces were now sent to Paris for judgement; from March to July, executions in Paris increased from five to twenty-six a day."
"Many Jacobins ridiculed the festival of the Cult of the Supreme Being on 8 June, a lavish and expensive ceremony led by Robespierre, who was also accused of circulating claims he was a second Messiah."
"Relaxation of price controls and rampant inflation caused increasing unrest among the sans-culottes, but the improved military situation reduced fears the Republic was in danger."
"Many feared their own survival depended on Robespierre's removal; during a meeting on 29 June, three members of the Committee of Public Safety called him a dictator in his face."
"Robespierre responded by not attending sessions, allowing his opponents to build a coalition against him."
"When he refused to give names, the session broke up in confusion."
"That evening he made the same speech at the Jacobins club, where it was greeted with huge applause and demands for execution of the 'traitors'."
"His voice failed when he tried to speak, a deputy crying ""The blood of Danton chokes him!"
"That evening, units loyal to the Convention stormed the building, and Robespierre was arrested after a failed suicide attempt."
François Furet argues the intense ideological commitment of the revolutionaries and their utopian goals required the extermination of any opposition.
"A middle position suggests violence was not inevitable but the product of a series of complex internal events, exacerbated by war."
"Although the victors of Thermidor asserted control over the Commune by executing their leaders, some of the leading ""terrorists"" retained their positions."
"They included Paul Barras, later chief executive of the French Directory, and Joseph Fouché, director of the killings in Lyon who served as Minister of Police under the Directory, the Consulate and Empire."
"Others were exiled or prosecuted, a process that took several months."
"Largely designed by Pierre Daunou and Boissy d'Anglas, it established a bicameral legislature, intended to slow down the legislative process, ending the wild swings of policy under the previous unicameral systems."
"Since they were also subject to stringent property qualification, it guaranteed the return of conservative or moderate deputies."
"Although these criticisms were certainly valid, it also faced internal unrest, a stagnating economy and an expensive war, while hampered by the impracticality of the constitution."
"As a result, the Directory was characterised by ""chronic violence, ambivalent forms of justice, and repeated recourse to heavy-handed repression."
"""Retention of the Conventionnels ensured the Thermidorians held a majority in the legislature and three of the five Directors, but they faced an increasing challenge from the right."
"Despite limited support from sections of the military, it was easily crushed, with Babeuf and other leaders executed."
"The same percentage were broadly centrist or unaffiliated, along with two Directors, Étienne-François Letourneur and Lazare Carnot."
"With Royalists apparently on the verge of power, the Republicans staged a coup on 4 September."
"The election results were cancelled, sixty-three leading royalists deported to French Guiana and new laws passed against émigrés, Royalists and ultra-Jacobins."
"Without a majority in the legislature, the Directors relied on the army to enforcing decrees and extract revenue from conquered territories."
"The architect of its end was Sieyès, who when asked what he had done during the Terror allegedly answered ""I survived""."
"Nominated to the Directory, his first action was removing Barras, using a coalition that included Talleyrand and former Jacobin Lucien Bonaparte, Napoleon's brother and president of the Council of 500."
"Austria was at war with the Ottomans, as were the Russians, while both were negotiating with Prussia over partitioning Poland."
"Since it expected a short war, the recruits were to serve for twelve months."
"It was a different kind of war, fought by nations rather than kings, intended to destroy their opponents' ability to resist, but also to implement deep-ranging social change."
"After defeating a second Austrian army at Jemappes on 6 November, they occupied the Netherlands, areas of the Rhineland, Nice and Savoy."
"Despite high rates of desertion, this was large enough to manage multiple internal and external threats; for comparison, the combined Prussian-Austrian army was less than 90,000."
"Second, armies were primarily loyal to their generals, for whom the wealth achieved by victory and the status it conferred became objectives in themselves."
"As long as the generals and their armies stayed away from Paris, they were happy to allow them to continue fighting, a key factor behind sanctioning Bonaparte's invasion of Egypt."
"""The Revolution in Saint Domingue was the most notable example of slave uprisings in French colonies."
Among the most significant were Marat's L'Ami du peuple and Elysée Loustallot's Revolutions de Paris.
"There was a widespread assumption writing was a vocation not a business, and the role of the press advancement of civic republicanism."
"To this end, symbols were borrowed from historic cultures and redefined, while those of the old regime were either destroyed or reattributed acceptable characteristics."
These revised symbols were used to instil in the public a new sense of tradition and reverence for the Enlightenment and the Republic.
It acquired its nickname after being sung in Paris by volunteers from Marseille marching on the capital.
"The song is the first example of the ""European march"" anthemic style, while the evocative melody and lyrics led to its widespread use as a song of revolution and incorporation into many pieces of classical and popular music."
De Lisle was instructed to 'produce a hymn which conveys to the soul of the people the enthusiasm which it (the music) suggests.'
"Invented by a physician during the Revolution as a quicker, more efficient and more distinctive form of execution, the guillotine became a part of popular culture and historic memory."
Vendors sold programmes listing the names of those scheduled to die.
"Many people came day after day and vied for the best locations from which to observe the proceedings; knitting women (tricoteuses) formed a cadre of hardcore regulars, inciting the crowd."
Parents often brought their children.
"By the end of the Terror, the crowds had thinned drastically."
"Repetition had staled even this most grisly of entertainments, and audiences grew bored."
They now pinned the blue-and-red cockade of Paris onto the white cockade of the Ancien Régime.
"Blue and red are the traditional colours of Paris, and they are used on the city's coat of arms."
"It reflects Roman republicanism and liberty, alluding to the Roman ritual of manumission, in which a freed slave receives the bonnet as a symbol of his newfound liberty."
"They expressed these demands using pamphlets and clubs such as the Cercle Social, whose largely male members viewed themselves as contemporary feminists."
"However, in October 1793, the Assembly banned all women's clubs and the movement was crushed; this was driven by the emphasis on masculinity in a wartime situation, antagonism towards feminine ""interference"" in state affairs due to Marie Antoinette, and traditional male supremacy."
"Activists included Girondists like Olympe de Gouges, author of the Declaration of the Rights of Woman and of the Female Citizen, and Charlotte Corday, the killer of Marat."
They also demanded vigorous price controls to keep bread – the major food of the poor people – from becoming too expensive.
Fist fights broke out in the streets between the two factions of women.
"Meanwhile, the men who controlled the Jacobins rejected the Revolutionary Republican Women as dangerous rabble-rousers."
"At this point the Jacobins controlled the government; they dissolved the Society of Revolutionary Republican Women, and decreed that all women's clubs and associations were illegal."
They sternly reminded women to stay home and tend to their families by leaving public affairs to the men.
Organised women were permanently shut out of the French Revolution after 30 October 1793.
"Her publications emphasised that women and men are different, but this shouldn't prevent equality under the law."
Manon or Marie Roland) was another important female activist.
Her political focus was not specifically on women or their liberation.
"She focused on other aspects of the government, but was a feminist by virtue of the fact that she was a woman working to influence the world."
"Her personal letters to leaders of the Revolution influenced policy; in addition, she often hosted political gatherings of the Brissotins, a political group which allowed women to join."
"This sparked a counter-revolutionary movement led by women; while supporting other political and social changes, they opposed the dissolution of the Catholic Church and revolutionary cults like the Cult of the Supreme Being."
"In response to this measure, women in many areas began circulating anti-oath pamphlets and refused to attend masses held by priests who had sworn oaths of loyalty to the Republic."
These women continued to adhere to traditional practices such as Christian burials and naming their children after saints in spite of revolutionary decrees to the contrary.
"All church lands were nationalised, along with those owned by Royalist exiles, which were used to back paper currency known as assignats, and the feudal guild system eliminated."
"It also abolished the highly inefficient system of tax farming, whereby private individuals would collect taxes for a hefty fee."
"The state sold the lands but typically local authorities did not replace the funding and so most of the nation's charitable and school systems were massively disruptedBetween 1790 to 1796, industrial and agricultural output dropped, foreign trade plunged, and prices soared, forcing the government to finance expenditure by issuing ever increasing quantities assignats."
"When this resulted in escalating inflation, the response was to impose price controls and persecute private speculators and traders, creating a Black market."
"Its impact on French nationalism was profound, while also stimulating nationalist movements throughout Europe."
"Its influence was great in the hundreds of small German states and elsewhere, where it was either inspired by the French example or in reaction against it."
The system established by Louis XIV centralised political power at Versailles and was controlled by the monarch.
"His power derived from immense personal wealth, control over the army and appointment of clergy, provincial governors, lawyers and judges."
"In less than a year, the king was reduced to a figurehead, the nobility deprived of titles and estates and the church of its monasteries and property."
"Clergy, judges and magistrates were controlled by the state, and the army sidelined, with military power placed held by the revolutionary National Guard."
"""The long-term impact on France was profound, shaping politics, society, religion and ideas, and polarising politics for more than a century."
"The French Revolution differed from other revolutions in being not merely national, for it aimed at benefiting all humanity."""
"In 1788, it held a dominant position within society, to the extent being French was synonymous with Catholicism."
"By 1799, much of its property and institutions had been confiscated and its senior leaders dead or in exile."
"Its cultural influence was also under attack, with efforts made to remove  such as Sundays, holy days, saints, prayers, rituals and ceremonies."
Ultimately these attempts not only failed but aroused a furious reaction among the pious; opposition to these changes was a key factor behind the revolt in the Vendée.
"Over the centuries, charitable foundations had been set up to fund hospitals, poor relief, and schools; when these were confiscated and sold off, the funding was not replaced, causing massive disruption to these support systems."
Demand remained strong and after 1800 nuns resumed their work in hospitals and on rural estates.
"An effort was made to replace the Catholic Church altogether with the Cult of Reason, and with civic festivals replacing religious ones, leading to attacks by locals on state officials."
"The Concordat was a compromise that restored some of the Church's traditional roles but not its power, lands or monasteries; the clergy became public officials controlled by Paris, not Rome, while Protestants and Jews gained equal rights."
"However, debate continues into the present over the role of religion in the public sphere and related issues such as church-controlled schools."
"Recent arguments over the use of Muslim religious symbols in schools, such as wearing headscarves, have been explicitly linked to the conflict over Catholic rituals and symbols during the Revolution."
"With the breakup of large estates controlled by the Church and the nobility and worked by hired hands, rural France became more a land of small independent farms."
"Harvest taxes were ended, such as the tithe and seigneurial dues, much to the relief of the peasants."
"Primogeniture was ended both for nobles and peasants, thereby weakening the family patriarch."
"Because all the children had a share in the family's property, there was a declining birth rate."
"Cobban says the Revolution bequeathed to the nation ""a ruling class of landowners."
"""In the cities, entrepreneurship on a small scale flourished, as restrictive monopolies, privileges, barriers, rules, taxes and guilds gave way."
"However, the British blockade virtually ended overseas and colonial trade, hurting the cities and their supply chains."
"Overall, the Revolution did not greatly change the French business system, and probably helped freeze in place the horizons of the small business owner."
"Another 2017 paper found that the redistribution of land had a positive impact on agricultural productivity, but that these gains gradually declined over the course of the 19th century."
"Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one."
"However, there were no efforts by the Bourbons, Vichy or anyone else to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789."
France permanently became a society of equals under the law.
"In the Soviet Union, ""Gracchus"" Babeuf was regarded as a hero."
"They suggest that ""areas that were occupied by the French and that underwent radical institutional reform experienced more rapid urbanization and economic growth, especially after 1850."
There is no evidence of a negative effect of French invasion.
"Yet in Britain the majority, especially among the aristocracy, strongly opposed the French Revolution."
"Britain led and funded the series of coalitions that fought France from 1793 to 1815, and then restored the Bourbons."
"Philosophically and politically, Britain was in debate over the rights and wrongs of revolution, in the abstract and in practicalities."
"The Revolution Controversy was a ""pamphlet war"" set off by the publication of A Discourse on the Love of Our Country, a speech given by Richard Price to the Revolution Society on 4 November 1789, supporting the French Revolution (as he had the American Revolution), and saying that patriotism actually centers around loving the people and principles of a nation, not its ruling class."
"It stimulated the demand for further reform throughout Ireland, especially in Ulster."
"At first it brought liberal and democratic ideas, the end of guilds, serfdom and the Jewish ghetto."
It brought economic freedoms and agrarian and legal reform.
Above all the antagonism helped stimulate and shape German nationalism.
"The interference with localism and traditional liberties was deeply resented, although some modernising reforms took place."
"In the Austrian Netherlands, the Brabant Revolution succeeded in expelling Austrian forces and established the new United Belgian States."
The Liège Revolution expelled the tyrannical Prince-Bishop and installed a republic.
Both failed to attract international support.
"During the Revolutionary Wars, the French invaded and occupied the region between 1794 and 1814, a time known as the French period."
"The new government enforced new reforms, incorporating the region into France itself."
New rulers were sent in by Paris.
Belgian men were drafted into the French wars and heavily taxed.
"Nearly everyone was Catholic, but the Church was repressed."
"Resistance was strong in every sector, as Belgian nationalism emerged to oppose French rule."
"The French legal system, however, was adopted, with its equal legal rights, and abolition of class distinctions."
"France promoted commerce and capitalism, paving the way for the ascent of the bourgeoisie and the rapid growth of manufacturing and mining."
"In economics, therefore, the nobility declined while middle-class Belgian entrepreneurs flourished because of their inclusion in a large market, paving the way for Belgium's leadership role after 1815 in the Industrial Revolution on the Continent."
Reform was gradual and the regime itself carried out agrarian reforms that had the effect of weakening absolutism by creating a class of independent peasant freeholders.
Much of the initiative came from well-organised liberals who directed political change in the first half of the 19th century.
"Press coverage in Quebec on the Revolution was reliant, and reflective of public opinion in London, with the colony's press reliant on newspapers and reprints from journals from the British Isles."
"The early positive reception of the French Revolution had made it politically difficult to justify withholding electoral institutions from the colony to both the British and Quebec public; with the British Home Secretary William Grenville remarking how it was hardly possible to ""maintain with success,"" the denial ""to so large a body of British Subjects, the benefits of the British Constitution""."
"Most of these migrants moved to Montreal or Quebec City, although French nobleman Joseph-Geneviève de Puisaye also led a small group of French royalists to settle lands north of York (present day Toronto)."
"The influx of religious migrants from France reinvigorated the Roman Catholic Church in the Canadas, with the refectory priests who moved to the colonies being responsible for the establishment of a number of parishes throughout the Canadas."
"George Washington and his unanimous cabinet, including Jefferson, decided that the treaty did not bind the United States to enter the war."
Washington proclaimed neutrality instead.
"Under President John Adams, a Federalist, an undeclared naval war took place with France from 1798 until 1799, often called the ""Quasi War""."
"However, the two entered negotiations over the Louisiana Territory and agreed to the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, an acquisition that substantially increased the size of the United States."
"The views of historians, in particular, have been characterised as falling along ideological lines, with disagreement over the significance and the major developments of the Revolution."
"The central theme of this argument was that the Revolution emerged from the rising bourgeoisie, with support from the sans-culottes, who fought to destroy the aristocracy."
"However, Western scholars largely abandoned Marxist interpretations in the 1990s."
"The old model or paradigm focusing on class conflict has been discredited, and no new explanatory model had gained widespread support."
"Within France itself, the Revolution permanently crippled the power of the aristocracy and drained the wealth of the Church, although the two institutions survived despite the damage they sustained."
"Revolution became a tradition, and republicanism an enduring option."
The Revolution represented the most significant and dramatic challenge to political absolutism up to that point in history and spread democratic ideals throughout Europe and ultimately the world.
"Throughout the 19th century, the revolution was heavily analysed by economists and political scientists, who saw the class nature of the revolution as a fundamental aspect in understanding human social evolution itself."
The Egyptian pyramids are ancient pyramid-shaped masonry structures located in Egypt.
Several of the Giza pyramids are counted among the largest structures ever built.
The Pyramid of Khufu is the largest Egyptian pyramid.
It is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World still in existence.
"Although Egyptologists often credit his vizier Imhotep as its architect, the dynastic Egyptians themselves, contemporaneously or in numerous later dynastic writings about the character, did not credit him with either designing Djoser's pyramid or the invention of stone architecture."
"The Pyramid of Djoser was first built as a square mastaba-like structure, which as a rule were known to otherwise be rectangular, and was expanded several times by way of a series of accretion layers, to produce the stepped pyramid structure we see today."
He gave up after only damaging the Pyramid of Menkaure because the task proved too large.
"The shape of a pyramid is also thought to be representative of the descending rays of the sun, and most pyramids were faced with polished, highly reflective white limestone, in order to give them a brilliant appearance when viewed from a distance."
Pyramids were often also named in ways that referred to solar luminescence.
"For example, the formal name of the Bent Pyramid at Dahshur was The Southern Shining Pyramid, and that of Senusret II at El Lahun was Senusret Shines."
"While it is generally agreed that pyramids were burial monuments, there is continued disagreement on the particular theological principles that might have given rise to them."
"One suggestion is that they were designed as a type of ""resurrection machine."
One of the narrow shafts that extend from the main burial chamber through the entire body of the Great Pyramid points directly towards the center of this part of the sky.
A great many more have since been discovered.
"If visible at all, they may appear as little more than mounds of rubble."
"As a consequence, archaeologists are continuing to identify and study previously unknown pyramid structures."
"The most important of these are listed geographically, from north to south, below."
"Originally it was thought that this pyramid had never been completed, but the current archaeological consensus is that not only was it completed, but that it was originally about the same size as the Pyramid of Menkaure, which would have placed it among the half-dozen or so largest pyramids in Egypt."
Its location adjacent to a major crossroads made it an easy source of stone.
"Quarrying, which began in Roman times, has left little apart from about fifteen courses of stone superimposed upon the natural hillock that formed part of the pyramid's core."
A small adjacent satellite pyramid is in a better state of preservation.
"Of the three, only Khafre's pyramid retains part of its original polished limestone casing, near its apex."
"This pyramid appears larger than the adjacent Khufu pyramid by virtue of its more elevated location, and the steeper angle of inclination of its construction – it is, in fact, smaller in both height and volume."
The Giza pyramid complex has been a popular tourist destination since antiquity and was popularized in Hellenistic times when the Great Pyramid was listed by Antipater of Sidon as one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
Today it is the only one of those wonders still in existence.
"The northern structure's owner is believed to be pharaoh Nebka, while the southern structure, known as the Layer Pyramid, may be attributable to the Third Dynasty pharaoh Khaba, a close successor of Sekhemkhet."
"If this attribution is correct, Khaba's short reign could explain the seemingly unfinished state of this step pyramid."
The quality of construction of the Abusir pyramids is inferior to those of the Fourth Dynasty – perhaps signaling a decrease in royal power or a less vibrant economy.
They are smaller than their predecessors and are built of low-quality local limestone.
"The three major pyramids are those of Niuserre, which is also the best-preserved, Neferirkare Kakai and Sahure."
The site is also home to the incomplete Pyramid of Neferefre.
"Most of the major pyramids at Abusir were built using similar construction techniques, comprising a rubble core surrounded by steps of mudbricks with a limestone outer casing."
"The largest of these Fifth Dynasty pyramids, the Pyramid of Neferirkare Kakai, is believed to have been built originally as a step pyramid some 70 m (230 ft) high and then later transformed into a ""true"" pyramid by having its steps filled in with loose masonry."
"Also at Saqqara is the Pyramid of Unas, which retains a pyramid causeway that is one of the best-preserved in Egypt."
"Together with the pyramid of Userkaf, this pyramid was the subject of one of the earliest known restoration attempts, conducted by Khaemweset, a son of Ramesses II."
"Saqqara is also the location of the incomplete step pyramid of Djoser's successor Sekhemkhet, known as the Buried Pyramid."
"Archaeologists believe that had this pyramid been completed, it would have been larger than Djoser's."
"South of the main pyramid field at Saqqara is a second collection of later, smaller pyramids, including those of Pepi I, Djedkare Isesi, Merenre, Pepi II and Ibi."
Most of these are in a poor state of preservation.
The Fourth Dynasty pharaoh Shepseskaf either did not share an interest in or have the capacity to undertake pyramid construction like his predecessors.
"His tomb, which is also sited at south Saqqara, was instead built as an unusually large mastaba and offering temple complex."
"The southern Pyramid of Sneferu, commonly known as the Bent Pyramid, is believed to be the first Egyptian pyramid intended by its builders to be a ""true"" smooth-sided pyramid from the outset; the earlier pyramid at Meidum had smooth sides in its finished state, but it was conceived and built as a step pyramid, before having its steps filled in and concealed beneath a smooth outer casing of dressed stone."
"As a true smooth-sided structure, the Bent Pyramid was only a partial success – albeit a unique, visually imposing one; it is also the only major Egyptian pyramid to retain a significant proportion of its original smooth outer limestone casing intact."
As such it serves as the best contemporary example of how the ancient Egyptians intended their pyramids to look.
Several kilometres to the north of the Bent Pyramid is the last – and most successful – of the three pyramids constructed during the reign of Sneferu; the Red Pyramid is the world's first successfully completed smooth-sided pyramid.
"The structure is also the third-largest pyramid in Egypt, after the pyramids of Khufu and Khafra at Giza."
"Also at Dahshur is one of two pyramids built by Amenemhat III, known as the Black Pyramid, as well as a number of small, mostly ruined subsidiary pyramids."
The latter is surrounded by the ruins of ten smaller subsidiary pyramids.
"One of these subsidiary pyramids is known to be that of Amenemhat's cousin, Khaba II."
"The site which is in the vicinity of the oasis of the Faiyum, midway between Dahshur and Meidum, and about 100 kilometres south of Cairo, is believed to be in the vicinity of the ancient city of Itjtawy (the precise location of which remains unknown), which served as the capital of Egypt during the Twelfth Dynasty."
"However, that attribution is uncertain, as no record of Huni's name has been found at the site."
"It was constructed as a step pyramid and then later converted into the first ""true"" smooth-sided pyramid, when the steps were filled in and an outer casing added."
The pyramid suffered several catastrophic collapses in ancient and medieval times.
"Medieval Arab writers described it as having seven steps, although today only the three uppermost of these remain, giving the structure its odd, tower-like appearance."
"The hill on which the pyramid is situated is not a natural landscape feature, it is the small mountain of debris created when the lower courses and outer casing of the pyramid gave way."
It is the Hawara pyramid that is believed to have been Amenemhet's final resting place.
Its builders reduced the amount of work necessary to construct it by using as its foundation and core a 12-meter-high natural limestone hill.
He was the first Egyptian pharaoh to be buried in a pyramid in centuries.
It was the largest in the area (North Sudan).
"Each pyramid is identified through the pharaoh who ordered it built, his approximate reign, and its location."
"In 2013, papyri discovered at the Egyptian desert near the Red Sea by archaeologist Pierre Tallet revealed the Diary of Merer, an official of Egypt involved in transporting limestone along the Nile River."
"It is possible that quarried blocks were then transported to the construction site by wooden sleds, with sand in front of the sled wetted to reduce friction."
"Droplets of water created bridges between the grains of sand, helping them stick together."
Its continental European territory is situated on the Iberian Peninsula.
"Its territory also includes two archipelagos: the Canary Islands off the coast of North Africa, and the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea."
Several small islands in the Alboran Sea are also part of Spanish territory.
"The country's mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean respectively."
"Spain's capital and largest city is Madrid; other major urban areas include Barcelona, Valencia, Seville, Zaragoza, Málaga, and Bilbao."
"Various cultures developed alongside Phoenician, Greek, Celtic and Carthaginian migration and settlement."
"Spain remained under Roman rule until the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the fourth century, which ushered in Germanic tribal confederations from Central Europe."
"The Visigoths emerged as the dominant faction by the fifth century, with their kingdom spanning much of the peninsula."
"In the early eighth century, the Visigothic Kingdom was conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate, ushering in over 700 years of Muslim rule."
"Islamic Spain became a major economic and intellectual center, with the city of Cordoba being among the largest and richest in Europe."
"Several Christian kingdoms emerged in the northern periphery of Iberia, chief among them León, Castile, Aragon, Portugal and Navarre."
"Over the next seven centuries, an intermittent southward expansion of these kingdoms—metahistorically framed as a reconquest, or Reconquista—culminated with the Christian seizure of the last Muslim polity, the Nasrid Kingdom of Granada, in 1492."
"That same year, Christopher Columbus arrived in the New World on behalf of the Catholic Monarchs, whose dynastic union of Castile and Aragon is sometimes considered the emergence Spain as a unified country."
Spain hosts the world's third-largest number of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.
"Spain is a secular parliamentary democracy and a parliamentary monarchy, with King Felipe VI as head of state."
"It is a highly developed country and a high income country, with the world's fourteenth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the sixteenth-largest by PPP."
"It may be a derivation of the Phoenician I-Shpania, meaning ""island of rabbits"", ""land of rabbits"" or ""edge"", a reference to Spain's location at the end of the Mediterranean; Roman coins struck in the region from the reign of Hadrian show a female figure with a rabbit at her feet, and Strabo called it the ""land of the rabbits""."
Both men wrote in two different published works that the first Jews to reach Spain were brought by ship by Phiros who was confederate with the king of Babylon when he laid siege to Jerusalem.
"Phiros was a Grecian by birth, but who had been given a kingdom in Spain."
"Phiros became related by marriage to Espan, the nephew of king Heracles, who also ruled over a kingdom in Spain."
"Heracles later renounced his throne in preference for his native Greece, leaving his kingdom to his nephew, Espan, from whom the country of España (Spain) took its name."
Early on its coastal areas were settled by Phoenicians who founded Western Europe's most ancient cities Cádiz and Málaga.
"Phoenician influence expanded as much of the Peninsula was eventually incorporated into the Carthaginian Empire, becoming a major theatre of the Punic Wars against the expanding Roman Empire."
"After an arduous conquest, the peninsula came fully under Roman rule."
"During the early Middle Ages it came under Visigothic rule, and then much of it was conquered by Muslim invaders from North Africa."
"In a process that took centuries, the small Christian kingdoms in the north gradually regained control of the peninsula."
"A global empire began which saw Spain become the strongest kingdom in Europe, the leading world power for one and a half  centuries, and the largest overseas empire for three centuries."
Continued wars and other problems eventually led to a diminished status.
"The Napoleonic conflict in Spain led to chaos, triggering independence movements that tore apart most of the empire and left the country politically unstable."
"Eventually, democracy was restored in the form of a parliamentary constitutional monarchy."
"Spain joined the European Union, experiencing a cultural renaissance and steady economic growth until the beginning of the 21st century, that started a new globalised world with economic and ecological challenges."
"In Atapuerca fossils have been found of the earliest known hominins in Europe, the Homo antecessor."
Archaeological and genetic evidence suggests that the Iberian Peninsula acted as one of several major refugia from which northern Europe was repopulated following the end of the last ice age.
The largest groups inhabiting the Iberian Peninsula before the Roman conquest were the Iberians and the Celts.
"The Iberians inhabited the Mediterranean side of the peninsula, from the northeast to the southeast."
"The Celts inhabited much of the inner and Atlantic sides of the peninsula, from the northwest to the southwest."
"Basques occupied the western area of the Pyrenees mountain range and adjacent areas, the Phoenician-influenced Tartessians culture flourished in the southwest and the Lusitanians and Vettones occupied areas in the central west."
"Several cities were founded along the coast by Phoenicians, and trading outposts and colonies were established by Greeks in the East."
"Eventually, Phoenician-Carthaginians expanded inland towards the meseta; however, due to the bellicose inland tribes, the Carthaginians got settled in the coasts of the Iberian Peninsula."
"Although it took the Romans nearly two centuries to complete the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, they retained control of it for over six centuries."
"Hispania served as a granary for the Roman market, and its harbours exported gold, wool, olive oil, and wine."
"Agricultural production increased with the introduction of irrigation projects, some of which remain in use."
"Emperors Hadrian, Trajan, Theodosius I, and the philosopher Seneca were born in Hispania."
"Most of Spain's present languages and religion, and the basis of its laws, originate from this period."
The Suebi established a kingdom in what is today modern Galicia and northern Portugal whereas the Vandals established themselves in southern Spain by 420 before crossing over to North Africa in 429 and taking Carthage in 439.
"As the western empire disintegrated, the social and economic base became greatly simplified: but even in modified form, the successor regimes maintained many of the institutions and laws of the late empire, including Christianity and assimilation to the evolving Roman culture."
"The Byzantines established an occidental province, Spania, in the south, with the intention of reviving Roman rule throughout Iberia."
"Eventually, however, Hispania was reunited under Visigothic rule."
"Wallia extended his rule over most of the peninsula, keeping the Suebians shut up in Galicia."
"Theodoric I took part, with the Romans and Franks, in the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains, where Attila was routed."
"Euric (466), who put an end to the last remnants of Roman power in the peninsula, may be considered the first monarch of Spain, though the Suebians still maintained their independence in Galicia."
Euric was also the first king to give written laws to the Visigoths.
"In the following reigns the Catholic kings of France assumed the role of protectors of the Hispano-Roman Catholics against the Arianism of the Visigoths, and in the wars which ensued Alaric II and Amalaric lost their lives."
"Athanagild, having risen against King Agila, called in the Byzantines and, in payment for the succour they gave him, ceded to them the maritime places of the southeast (554)."
"Liuvigild restored the political unity of the peninsula, subduing the Suebians, but the religious divisions of the country, reaching even the royal family, brought on a civil war."
The religious unity established by this council was the basis of that fusion of Goths with Hispano-Romans which produced the Spanish nation.
The Spanish-Gothic scholars such as Braulio of Zaragoza and Isidore of Seville played an important role in keeping the classical Greek and Roman culture.
"Isidore was one of the most influential clerics and philosophers in the Middle Ages in Europe, and his theories were also vital to the conversion of the Visigothic Kingdom from an Arian domain to a Catholic one in the Councils of Toledo."
Isidore created the first western encyclopedia which had a huge impact during the Middle Ages.
These conquests were part of the expansion of the Umayyad Caliphate.
Only a small area in the mountainous north-west of the peninsula managed to resist the initial invasion.
"Legend has it that Count Julian, the governor of Ceuta, in revenge for the violation of his daughter, Florinda, by King Roderic, invited the Muslims and opened to them the gates of the peninsula."
"Under Islamic law, Christians and Jews were given the subordinate status of dhimmi."
"The Berber people of North Africa, who had provided the bulk of the invading armies, clashed with the Arab leadership from the Middle East."
"Over time, large Moorish populations became established, especially in the Guadalquivir River valley, the coastal plain of Valencia, the Ebro River valley and (towards the end of this period) in the mountainous region of Granada."
"Córdoba, the capital of the caliphate since Abd-ar-Rahman III, was the largest, richest and most sophisticated city in western Europe."
Mediterranean trade and cultural exchange flourished.
Muslims imported a rich intellectual tradition from the Middle East and North Africa.
"Some important philosophers at the time were Averroes, Ibn Arabi and Maimonides."
"The Romanised cultures of the Iberian Peninsula interacted with Muslim and Jewish cultures in complex ways, giving the region a distinctive culture."
"The arrival from North Africa of the Islamic ruling sects of the Almoravids and the Almohads restored unity upon the Muslim holdings, with a stricter, less tolerant application of Islam, and saw a revival in Muslim fortunes."
This re-united Islamic state experienced more than a century of successes that partially reversed Christian gains.
The Reconquista (Reconquest) was the centuries-long period in which Christian rule was re-established over the Iberian Peninsula.
The Reconquista is viewed as beginning with the Battle of Covadonga won by Don Pelayo in 722 and was concurrent with the period of Muslim rule on the Iberian Peninsula.
The Christian army's victory over Muslim forces led to the creation of the Christian Kingdom of Asturias along the northwestern coastal mountains.
"The Kingdom of Castile, formed from Leonese territory, was its successor as strongest kingdom."
The kings and the nobility fought for power and influence in this period.
"The example of the Roman emperors influenced the political objective of the Crown, while the nobles benefited from feudalism."
"Muslim armies had also moved north of the Pyrenees but they were defeated by Frankish forces at the Battle of Poitiers, Frankia and pushed out of the very southernmost region of France along the seacoast by the 760s."
"Later, Frankish forces established Christian counties on the southern side of the Pyrenees."
These areas were to grow into the kingdoms of Navarre and Aragon.
"For several centuries, the fluctuating frontier between the Muslim and Christian controlled areas of Iberia was along the Ebro and Douro valleys."
The Islamic transmission of the classics is the main Islamic contributions to Medieval Europe.
"Basque, the only non-Romance language in Spain, continued evolving from Early Basque to Medieval."
"From the mid 13th century, literature and philosophy started to flourish again in the Christian peninsular kingdoms, based on Roman and Gothic traditions."
An important philosopher from this time is Ramon Llull.
Abraham Cresques was a prominent Jewish cartographer.
Roman law and its institutions were the model for the legislators.
"The king Alfonso X of Castile focused on strengthening this Roman and Gothic past, and also on linking the Iberian Christian kingdoms with the rest of medieval European Christendom."
Alfonso worked for being elected emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and published the Siete Partidas code.
"The Toledo School of Translators is the name that commonly describes the group of scholars who worked together in the city of Toledo during the 12th and 13th centuries, to translate many of the philosophical and scientific works from Classical Arabic, Ancient Greek, and Ancient Hebrew."
"The 13th century also witnessed the Crown of Aragon, centred in Spain's north east, expand its reach across islands in the Mediterranean, to Sicily and Naples."
"Having conquered these, they turned their arms against the Byzantines, who treacherously slew their leaders; but for this treachery, the Spaniards, under Bernard of Rocafort and Berenguer of Entenca, exacted the terrible penalty celebrated in history as ""The Catalan Vengeance"" and seized the Frankish Duchy of Athens (1311)."
"The royal line of Aragon became extinct with Martin the Humane, and the Compromise of Caspe gave the Crown to the House of Trastámara, already reigning in Castile."
"As in the rest of Europe during the Late Middle Ages, Antisemitism greatly increased during the 14th century in the Christian kingdoms (a key event in that regard was the Black Death, as Jews were accused of poisoning the waters)."
"In 1391, Christian mobs went from town to town throughout Castile and Aragon, killing an estimated 50,000 Jews."
"Women and children were sold as slaves to Muslims, and many synagogues were converted into churches."
"1478 commenced the completion of the conquest of the Canary Islands and in 1492, the combined forces of Castile and Aragon captured the Emirate of Granada from its last ruler Muhammad XII, ending the last remnant of a 781-year presence of Islamic rule in Iberia."
"That same year, Spain's Jews were ordered to convert to Catholicism or face expulsion from Spanish territories during the Spanish Inquisition."
"A few decades after the Morisco rebellion of Granada known as the War of the Alpujarras, a significant proportion of Spain's formerly-Muslim population was expelled, settling primarily in North Africa."
"Columbus's first voyage crossed the Atlantic and reached the Caribbean Islands, beginning the European exploration and conquest of the Americas, although Columbus remained convinced that he had reached the Orient."
"Large numbers of indigenous Americans died in battle against the Spaniards during the conquest, while others died from various other causes."
Some scholars consider the initial period of the Spanish conquest— from Columbus's first landing in the Bahamas until the middle of the sixteenth century—as marking the most egregious case of genocide in the history of mankind.
The colonisation of the Americas started with conquistadores like Hernán Cortés and Francisco Pizarro.
Miscegenation was the rule between the native and the Spanish cultures and people.
"Juan Sebastian Elcano completed the first voyage around the world in human history, the Magellan-Elcano circumnavigation."
"Andrés de Urdaneta discovered the tornaviaje or return route from the Philippines to Mexico, making possible the Manila galleon trading route."
"The Spanish once again encountered Islam, but this time in Southeast Asia and in order to incorporate the Philippines, Spanish expeditions organised from newly Christianised Mexico had invaded the Philippine territories of the Sultanate of Brunei."
"The Spanish used the conflict between Pagan and Muslim Philippine kingdoms to pit them against each other thus using the ""Divide and Conquer Principle""."
"The Spanish considered the war with the Muslims of Brunei and the Philippines, a repeat of the Reconquista."
"With their wide-ranging political, legal, religious and military reforms, Spain emerged as the first world power."
"The death of their son Prince John caused the Crown to pass to Charles I (the Emperor Charles V), son of Juana la Loca."
"The unification of the crowns of Aragon and Castile by the marriage of their sovereigns laid the basis for modern Spain and the Spanish Empire, although each kingdom of Spain remained a separate country socially, politically, legally, and in currency and language."
There were two big revolts against the new Habsburg monarch and the more authoritarian and imperial-style crown: Revolt of the Comuneros in Castile and Revolt of the Brotherhoods in Majorca and Valencia.
"After years of combat, Comuneros Juan López de Padilla, Juan Bravo and Francisco Maldonado were executed and María Pacheco went into exile."
Germana de Foix also finished with the revolt in the Mediterranean.
"This period saw the Italian Wars, the Schmalkaldic War, the Dutch Revolt, the War of the Portuguese Succession, clashes with the Ottomans, intervention in the French Wars of Religion and the Anglo-Spanish War."
"Through exploration and conquest or royal marriage alliances and inheritance, the Spanish Empire expanded to include vast areas in the Americas, islands in the Asia-Pacific area, areas of Italy, cities in Northern Africa, as well as parts of what are now France, Germany, Belgium, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands."
It was the first empire on which it was said that the sun never set.
"This was an Age of Discovery, with daring explorations by sea and by land, the opening-up of new trade routes across oceans, conquests and the beginnings of European colonialism."
"Spanish explorers brought back precious metals, spices, luxuries, and previously unknown plants, and played a leading part in transforming the European understanding of the globe."
The cultural efflorescence witnessed during this period is now referred to as the Spanish Golden Age.
The expansion of the empire caused immense upheaval in the Americas as the collapse of societies and empires and new diseases from Europe devastated American indigenous populations.
"The rise of humanism, the Counter-Reformation and new geographical discoveries and conquests raised issues that were addressed by the intellectual movement now known as the School of Salamanca, which developed the first modern theories of what are now known as international law and human rights."
Juan Luis Vives was another prominent humanist during this period.
The Protestant Reformation dragged the kingdom ever more deeply into the mire of religiously charged wars.
The result was a country forced into ever-expanding military efforts across Europe and in the Mediterranean.
These conflicts drained it of resources and undermined the economy generally.
"Spain managed to hold on to most of the scattered Habsburg empire, and help the imperial forces of the Holy Roman Empire reverse a large part of the advances made by Protestant forces, but it was finally forced to recognise the separation of Portugal and the United Provinces, and eventually suffered some serious military reverses to France in the latter stages of the immensely destructive, Europe-wide Thirty Years' War."
"In the latter half of the 17th century, Spain went into a gradual decline, during which it surrendered several small territories to France and England; however, it maintained and enlarged its vast overseas empire, which remained intact until the beginning of the 19th century."
The decline culminated in a controversy over succession to the throne which consumed the first years of the 18th century.
"The War of the Spanish Succession was a wide-ranging international conflict combined with a civil war, and was to cost the kingdom its European possessions and its position as one of the leading powers on the Continent."
"During this war, a new dynasty originating in France, the Bourbons, was installed."
The new Bourbon monarchy drew on the French system of modernising the administration and the economy.
Enlightenment ideas began to gain ground among some of the kingdom's elite and monarchy.
Bourbon reformers created formal disciplined militias across the Atlantic.
"Spain needed every hand it could take during the seemingly endless wars of the eighteenth century—the Spanish War of Succession or Queen Anne's War (1702–13), the War of Jenkins' Ear (1739–42) which became the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–48), the Seven Years' War (1756–63) and the Anglo-Spanish War (1779–83)—and its new disciplined militias served around the Atlantic as needed."
Napoleon's troops entered the country to invade Portugal but instead occupied Spain's major fortresses.
"The Spanish king abdicated in favour of Napoleon's brother, Joseph Bonaparte."
Joseph Bonaparte was seen as a puppet monarch and was regarded with scorn by the Spanish.
These revolts marked the beginning of a devastating war of independence against the Napoleonic regime.
"It met as one body, and its members represented the entire Spanish empire."
These events foreshadowed the conflict between conservatives and liberals in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
Spain's conquest by France benefited Latin American anti-colonialists who resented the Imperial Spanish government's policies that favoured Spanish-born citizens (Peninsulars) over those born overseas (Criollos) and demanded retroversion of the sovereignty to the people.
"King Ferdinand VII's attempt to re-assert control proved futile as he faced opposition not only in the colonies but also in Spain and army revolts followed, led by liberal officers."
"The Napoleonic War left Spain economically ruined, deeply divided and politically unstable."
"Isabelline forces prevailed, but the conflict between progressives and moderates ended in a weak early constitutional period."
In the late 19th century nationalist movements arose in the Philippines and Cuba.
"El Desastre (the Disaster), as the war became known in Spain, gave added impetus to the Generation of '98 who were analyzing the country."
"Although the period around the turn of the century was one of increasing prosperity, the 20th century brought little social peace; Spain played a minor part in the scramble for Africa, with the colonisation of Western Sahara, Spanish Morocco and Equatorial Guinea."
The heavy losses suffered during the Rif War in Morocco brought discredit to the government and undermined the monarchy.
"Industrialisation, the development of railways and incipient capitalism developed in several areas of the country, particularly in Barcelona, as well as Labour movement and socialist and anarchist ideas."
"In the anarcho-sindicalist trend of the labour movement in Spain, Confederación Nacional del Trabajo was founded in 1910 and Federación Anarquista Ibérica in 1927."
"Catalanism and vasquism, alongside other nationalisms and regionalisms in Spain, arose in that period, being the Basque Nationalist Party formed in 1895 and Regionalist League of Catalonia in 1901."
Political corruption and repression weakened the democratic system of the constitutional monarchy of a two-parties system.
The Tragic Week events and repression examples the social instability of the time.
"These gave a resounding victory to the Republican-Socialist candidacies in large cities and provincial capitals, with a majority of monarchist councilors in rural areas."
"During the Second Republic there was a great political and social upheaval, marked by a sharp radicalization of the left and the right."
"On the other hand, it is also during the Second Republic when important reforms to modernize the country were initiated: a democratic constitution, agrarian reform, restructuring of the army, political decentralization and women's right to vote."
"The situation led to a civil war, in which the territory was divided into two zones: one under the authority of the Republican government, that counted on outside support from the Soviet Union and Mexico (and from International Brigades), and the other controlled by the putschists (the Nationalist or rebel faction), most critically supported by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy."
The Republic was not supported by the Western powers due to the British-led policy of non-intervention.
An uneasy relationship between the Republican government and the grassroots anarchists who had initiated a partial Social revolution also ensued.
The civil war was viciously fought and there were many atrocities committed by all sides.
"The regime remained chiefly ""neutral"" from a nominal standpoint in the Second World War (it briefly switched its position to ""non-belligerent""), although it was sympathetic to the Axis and provided the Nazi Wehrmacht with Spanish volunteers in the Eastern Front."
"The name of ""Movimiento Nacional"", sometimes understood as a wider structure than the FET y de las JONS proper, largely imposed over the later's name in official documents along the 1950s."
"After World War II Spain was politically and economically isolated, and was kept out of the United Nations."
"Franco's rule was also characterised by authoritarianism, promotion of a unitary national identity, National Catholicism, and discriminatory language policies."
"The conventional explosives in two of the Mk28-type hydrogen bombs detonated upon impact with the ground, dispersing plutonium over nearby farms."
"With the approval of the new Spanish Constitution of 1978 and the restoration of democracy, the State devolved much authority to the regions and created an internal organisation based on autonomous communities."
"The Spanish 1977 Amnesty Law let people of Franco's regime continue inside institutions without consequences, even perpetrators of some crimes during transition to democracy like the Massacre of 3 March 1976 in Vitoria or 1977 Massacre of Atocha."
"In the Basque Country, moderate Basque nationalism coexisted with a radical nationalist movement led by the armed organisation ETA until the latter's dissolution in May 2018."
The group was formed in 1959 during Franco's rule but has continued to wage its violent campaign even after the restoration of democracy and the return of a large measure of regional autonomy.
"New cultural movements based on freedom appeared, like La Movida Madrileña and a culture of human rights arose with Gregorio Peces-Barba."
"That year the Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) came to power, the first left-wing government in 43 years."
"Though initial suspicions focused on the Basque terrorist group ETA, evidence soon emerged indicating Islamist involvement."
In 2005 the Spanish government legalised same sex marriage.
"Decentralisation was supported with much resistance of Constitutional Court and conservative opposition, so did gender politics like quotas or the law against gender violence."
"High levels of unemployment, cuts in government spending and corruption in Royal family and People's Party served as a backdrop to the 2011–12 Spanish protests."
Catalan independentism also rose.
"As prime minister, he continued to implement austerity measures required by the EU Stability and Growth Pact."
Later that day the Senate granted the power to impose direct rule and Mr Rajoy dissolved the Catalan parliament and called a new election.
Mount Teide (Tenerife) is the highest mountain peak in Spain and is the third largest volcano in the world from its base.
"Spain is a transcontinental country, having territory in both Europe and Africa."
"Along the Pyrenees in Girona, a small exclave town called Llívia is surrounded by France."
The peninsula of Vélez de la Gomera is also regarded as a plaza de soberanía.
"The isle of Alborán, located in the Mediterranean between Spain and North Africa, is also administered by Spain, specifically by the municipality of Almería, Andalusia."
The little Pheasant Island in the River Bidasoa is a Spanish-French condominium.
"Alluvial plains are found along the coast, the largest of which is that of the Guadalquivir in Andalusia."
The Csa zone is associated to areas with hot summers.
"It is predominant in the Mediterranean and Southern Atlantic coast and inland throughout Andalusia, Extremadura and much, if not most, of the centre of the country."
"The Csa zone covers climatic zones with both relatively warm and cold winters which are considered extremely different to each other at a local level, reason for which Köppen classification is often eschewed within Spain."
"Local climatic maps generally divide the Mediterranean zone (which covers most of the country) between warm-winter and cold-winter zones, rather than according to summer temperatures."
"Note areas with relatively high rainfall such as Galicia are not considered Mediterranean under local classifications, but classed as oceanic."
"It covers most of the Region of Murcia, southern Valencia and eastern Andalusia, where true hot desert climates also exist."
"Further to the north, it is predominant in the upper and mid reaches of the Ebro valley, which crosses southern Navarre, central Aragon and western Catalonia."
"It also is found in Madrid, Extremadura, Castilla-La Mancha, and some locations of western Andalusia."
The dry season extends beyond the summer and average temperature depends on altitude and latitude.
"The oceanic climate (Cfb), located in the northern quarter of the country, especially in the Atlantic region (Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias, and partly Galicia and Castile–León)."
"Additionally it is also found in northern Navarre, in most highlands areas along the Iberian System and in the Pyrenean valleys, where a humid subtropical variant (Cfa) also occurs."
"The vegetation of Spain is varied due to several factors including the diversity of the terrain, the climate and latitude."
"Spain includes different phytogeographic regions, each with its own floral characteristics resulting largely from the interaction of climate, topography, soil type and fire, and biotic factors."
"In June 1976, Spain's new King Juan Carlos dismissed Carlos Arias Navarro and appointed the reformer Adolfo Suárez as Prime Minister."
The constitution also specifies that Spain has no state religion and that all are free to practice and believe as they wish.
The Spanish administration approved the Gender Equality Act in 2007 aimed at furthering equality between genders in Spanish political and economic life.
"The executive branch consists of a Council of Ministers presided over by the Prime Minister, who is nominated as candidate by the monarch after holding consultations with representatives from the different parliamentary groups, voted in by the members of the lower house during an investiture session and then formally appointed by the monarch."
"Deputy prime ministers (designated by the Prime Minister): Currently Carmen Calvo Poyato (1st), Pablo Iglesias Turrión (2nd), Nadia Calviño Santamaría (3rd), Teresa Ribera Rodríguez (4th)."
"Spain is organisationally structured as a so-called Estado de las Autonomías (""State of Autonomies""); it is one of the most decentralised countries in Europe, along with Switzerland, Germany and Belgium; for example, all autonomous communities have their own elected parliaments, governments, public administrations, budgets, and resources."
"Health and education systems among others are managed by the Spanish communities, and in addition, the Basque Country and Navarre also manage their own public finances based on foral provisions."
"In Catalonia, the Basque Country, Navarre and the Canary Islands, a full-fledged autonomous police corps replaces some of the State police functions (see Mossos d'Esquadra, Ertzaintza, Policía Foral/Foruzaingoa and Policía Canaria)."
Spain's EU membership represents an important part of its foreign policy.
"The overwhelming majority of Gibraltarians strongly oppose this, along with any proposal of shared sovereignty."
UN resolutions call on the United Kingdom and Spain to reach an agreement over the status of Gibraltar.
"The Spanish claim makes a distinction between the isthmus that connects the Rock to the Spanish mainland on the one hand, and the Rock and city of Gibraltar on the other."
"While the Rock and city were ceded by the Treaty of Utrecht, Spain asserts that the ""occupation of the isthmus is illegal and against the principles of International Law""."
"In clash with the Portuguese position, Spain claims that they are rocks rather than islands, and therefore Spain does not accept any extension of the Portuguese Exclusive Economic Zone (200 nautical miles) generated by the islands, while acknowledging the Selvagens having territorial waters (12 nautical miles)."
Its sovereignty is disputed between Spain and Morocco.
The incident ended when both countries agreed to return to the status quo ante which existed prior to the Moroccan occupation of the island.
The islet is now deserted and without any sign of sovereignty.
"Besides the Perejil Island, the Spanish-held territories claimed by other countries are two: Morocco claims the Spanish cities of Ceuta and Melilla and the plazas de soberanía islets off the northern coast of Africa."
Portugal does not recognise Spain's sovereignty over the territory of Olivenza which was annexed by Spain in 1801 after the War of the Oranges.
Portugal stance has been the territory being de iure Portuguese territory and de facto Spanish.
"Their Commander-in-chief is the King of Spain, Felipe VI."
The next military authorities in line are the Prime Minister and the Minister of Defence.
The fourth military authority of the State is the Chief of the Defence Staff (JEMAD).
"The concept of a comarca exists in all autonomous communities, however, unlike Catalonia, these are merely historical or geographical subdivisions."
"The autonomous communities were to comprise adjacent provinces with common historical, cultural, and economic traits."
"This territorial organisation, based on devolution, is known in Spain as the ""State of Autonomies""."
The basic institutional law of each autonomous community is the Statute of Autonomy.
"Andalusia also took that denomination in its first Statute of Autonomy, even though it followed the longer process stipulated in the constitution for the rest of the country."
"The distribution of powers may be different for every community, as laid out in their Statutes of Autonomy, since devolution was intended to be asymmetrical."
"In addition, the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre have police corps of their own: Ertzaintza, Mossos d'Esquadra and the Policía Foral respectively."
"Other communities have more limited forces or none at all, like the Policía Autónoma Andaluza in Andalusia or the BESCAM in Madrid."
"Nonetheless, recent amendments to existing Statutes of Autonomy or the promulgation of new Statutes altogether, have reduced the asymmetry between the powers originally granted to the nationalities and the rest of the regions."
These are two exclaves located in the northern African coast.
"In turn, provinces are divided into municipalities."
"The existence of both the provinces and the municipalities is guaranteed and protected by the constitution, not necessarily by the Statutes of Autonomy themselves."
"The communities of Asturias, Cantabria, La Rioja, the Balearic Islands, Madrid, Murcia and Navarre are the only communities that comprise a single province, which is coextensive with the community itself."
"In these cases, the administrative institutions of the province are replaced by the governmental institutions of the community."
The centre-right government of former prime minister José María Aznar worked successfully to gain admission to the group of countries launching the euro in 1999.
"Spain is the second biggest foreign investor there, after the United States."
"Spanish companies have also expanded into Asia, especially China and India."
This early global expansion is a competitive advantage over its competitors and European neighbours.
The reason for this early expansion is the booming interest towards Spanish language and culture in Asia and Africa and a corporate culture that learned to take risks in unstable markets.
"Areas relying on non-irrigated cultivation (secano), which made up 85% of the entire crop area, depended solely on rainfall as a source of water."
"They included the humid regions of the north and the northwest, as well as vast arid zones that had not been irrigated."
"The much more productive regions devoted to irrigated cultivation (regadío) accounted for 3 million hectares in 1986, and the government hoped that this area would eventually double, as it already had doubled since 1950."
Particularly noteworthy was the development in Almería—one of the most arid and desolate provinces of Spain—of winter crops of various fruits and vegetables for export to Europe.
"More than half of the irrigated area was planted in corn, fruit trees, and vegetables."
"Other agricultural products that benefited from irrigation included grapes, cotton, sugar beets, potatoes, legumes, olive trees, mangos, strawberries, tomatoes, and fodder grasses."
"Depending on the nature of the crop, it was possible to harvest two successive crops in the same year on about 10% of the country's irrigated land."
"Because of the changed diet of an increasingly affluent population, there was a notable increase in the consumption of livestock, poultry, and dairy products."
"Meat production for domestic consumption became the single most important agricultural activity, accounting for 30% of all farm-related production in 1983."
Increased attention to livestock was the reason that Spain became a net importer of grains.
"Ideal growing conditions, combined with proximity to important north European markets, made citrus fruits Spain's leading export."
"Fresh vegetables and fruits produced through intensive irrigation farming also became important export commodities, as did sunflower seed oil that was produced to compete with the more expensive olive oils in oversupply throughout the Mediterranean countries of the European Community."
The headquarters of the World Tourism Organization are located in Madrid.
"Spain's geographic location, popular coastlines, diverse landscapes, historical legacy, vibrant culture, and excellent infrastructure has made the country's international tourist industry among the largest in the world."
Spain is also Europe's main producer of wind energy.
"The former Minister of Industry Miguel Sebastián said that ""the electric vehicle is the future and the engine of an industrial revolution."
"On average, the Spanish high-speed train is the fastest one in the world, followed by the Japanese bullet train and the French TGV."
There are 47 public airports in Spain.
"Also, more than 30 airports with the number of passengers below 4 million."
"Despite the conditions, some important scientists and engineers emerged."
"The most notable were Miguel Servet, Santiago Ramón y Cajal, Narcís Monturiol, Celedonio Calatayud, Juan de la Cierva, Leonardo Torres y Quevedo, Margarita Salas and Severo Ochoa."
The Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) is the leading public agency dedicated to scientific research in the country.
"With the exception of the region surrounding the capital, Madrid, the most populated areas lie around the coast."
A sizeable portion of foreign residents in Spain also comes from other Western and Central European countries.
"These are mostly British, French, German, Dutch, and Norwegian."
"They reside primarily on the Mediterranean coast and the Balearic islands, where many choose to live their retirement or telecommute."
"Substantial populations descended from Spanish colonists and immigrants exist in other parts of the world, most notably in Latin America."
Spain has been described as a de facto plurinational state.
The identity of Spain rather accrues of an overlap of different territorial and ethnolinguistic identities than of a sole Spanish identity.
In some cases some of the territorial identities may conflict with the dominant Spanish culture.
"Distinct traditional identities within Spain include the Basques, Catalans, Galicians, Andalusians and Valencians, although to some extent all of the 17 autonomous communities may claim a distinct local identity."
"It is this last feature of ""shared identity"" between the more local level or autonomous community and the Spanish level which makes the identity question in Spain complex and far from univocal."
Smaller numbers of immigrants from several Sub-Saharan countries have recently been settling in Spain.
"There are also sizeable numbers of Asian immigrants, most of whom are of Middle Eastern, South Asian and Chinese origin."
Their origin is unclear.
"Historically, Sephardi Jews and Moriscos are the main minority groups originated in Spain and with a contribution to Spanish culture."
The Spanish government is offering Spanish nationality to Sephardi Jews.
"There are a number of reasons for the high level of immigration, including Spain's cultural ties with Latin America, its geographical position, the porosity of its borders, the large size of its underground economy and the strength of the agricultural and construction sectors, which demand more low cost labour than can be offered by the national workforce."
Another statistically significant factor is the large number of residents of EU origin typically retiring to Spain's Mediterranean coast.
"The programme had little effect; during its first two months, just 1,400 immigrants took up the offer."
"What the programme failed to do, the sharp and prolonged economic crisis has done from 2010 to 2011 in that tens of thousands of immigrants have left the country due to lack of jobs."
"For the first time in decades the net migration rate was expected to be negative, and nine out of 10 emigrants were foreigners."
"In the North African Spanish autonomous city of Melilla, Riff Berber is spoken by a significant part of the population."
"Similarly, in Ceuta Darija Arabic is spoken by a significant percentage of the population."
"In the tourist areas of the Mediterranean coast and the islands, English and German are widely spoken by tourists, foreign residents, and tourism workers."
"In regards to the professional development education or the vocational education, there are three levels besides the university degrees: the Formación Profesional Básica (basic vocational education); the Ciclo Formativo de Grado Medio or CFGM (medium level vocation education) which can be studied after studying the secondary education, and the Ciclo Formativo de Grado Superior or CFGS (higher level vocational education), which can be studied after studying the post-16 education level."
"The health care is public, universal and free for any legal citizen of Spain."
"Although it no longer has official status by law, in all public schools in Spain students have to choose either a religion or ethics class."
"Catholicism is the religion most commonly taught, although the teaching of Islam, Judaism, and evangelical Christianity is also recognised in law."
Most Spaniards do not participate regularly in religious services.
There have been four Spanish Popes.
"Spanish mysticism provided an important intellectual resource against Protestantism with Carmelites like Teresa of Ávila, a reformist nun and John of the Cross, a priest, taking the lead in their reform movement."
"Later, they became Doctors of the Church."
"The Society of Jesus was co-founded by Ignatius of Loyola, whose Spiritual Exercises and movement led to the establishment of hundreds of colleges and universities in the world, including 28 in the United States alone."
"The Society's co-founder, Francis Xavier, was a missionary who reached India and later Japan."
Late 19th-century colonial expansion in northwestern Africa gave a number of residents in Spanish Morocco and Western Sahara full citizenship.
"Most are arrivals in the past century, while some are descendants of earlier Spanish Jews."
"Almost every aspect of Spanish life is permeated by its Roman heritage, making Spain one of the major Latin countries of Europe."
"Spanish culture is marked by strong historic ties to Catholicism, which played a pivotal role in the country's formation and subsequent identity."
"Spanish art, architecture, cuisine, and music have been shaped by successive waves of foreign invaders, as well as by the country's Mediterranean climate and geography."
"The centuries-long colonial era globalised Spanish language and culture, with Spain also absorbing the cultural and commercial products of its diverse empire."
"These include the landscape of Monte Perdido in the Pyrenees, which is shared with France, the Prehistoric Rock Art Sites of the Côa Valley and Siega Verde, which is shared with Portugal, the Heritage of Mercury, shared with Slovenia and the Ancient and Primeval Beech Forests, shared with other countries of Europe."
The Valencian chivalric romance Tirant lo Blanch written in Valencian is also remarkable.
"Other major plays from the medieval times were Mester de Juglaría, Mester de Clerecía, Coplas por la muerte de su padre or El Libro de buen amor (The Book of Good Love)."
The Baroque is the most important period for Spanish culture.
We are in the times of the Spanish Empire.
The famous Don Quijote de La Mancha by Miguel de Cervantes was written in this time.
Realism offered depictions of contemporary life and society 'as they were'.
"In the spirit of general ""Realism"", Realist authors opted for depictions of everyday and banal activities and experiences, instead of romanticised or stylised presentations."
"The group that has become known as the Generation of 1898 was marked by the destruction of Spain's fleet in Cuba by US gunboats in 1898, which provoked a cultural crisis in Spain."
"These writers, along with Ramón del Valle-Inclán, Antonio Machado, Ramiro de Maeztu, and Ángel Ganivet, came to be known as the Generation of '98."
"The next supposed ""generation"" of Spanish writers following those of '98 already calls into question the value of such terminology."
"While still driven by the national and existential questions that obsessed the writers of '98, they approached these topics with a greater sense of distance and objectivity."
"Salvador de Madariaga, another prominent intellectual and writer, was one of the founders of the College of Europe and the composer of the constitutive manifest of the Liberal International."
"All were scholars of their national literary heritage, again evidence of the impact of the calls of regeneracionistas and the Generation of 1898 for Spanish intelligence to turn at least partially inwards."
"Spain is one of the countries with the most laureates of the Nobel Prize in Literature, and including Latin American Nobel laureates, Spanish language literature ranks among the highest in numbers of laureates."
Saramago was also well known by his Iberist ideas.
Premio Planeta de Novela and Miguel de Cervantes Prize are the two main awards nowadays in Spanish literature.
"Due to historical, geographical and generational diversity, Spanish art has known a great number of influences."
"The Mediterranean heritage with Greco-Roman and some Moorish and influences in Spain, especially in Andalusia, is still evident today."
